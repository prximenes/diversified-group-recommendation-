<Content>Over-priced, poorly thought through amenities If you are male, not allergic to feathers, and tolerant of small amounts of dirt in high priced hotels, then this hotel may be for you. If you don't have a feather allergy, the bed was fantastic. Even with the feather mattress topper stripped off, it was extremely comfortable and extremely large with no roll together and no transmission of your other half's fidgeting. Unfortunately, in two nights, their best replacement for the feather mattress topper, pillows and duvet, was three tatty non-feather pillows and a couple of blankets which it took 30 minutes and two phones calls to get (one of which the chambermaid took away when she came, without replacing it with the requested non-feather duvet, leading to yet another later night phone call to get enough bedding to sleep in back). This is also the only hotel I've ever been in that considers one sanitary bag the appropriate number for each 24 hours (and the bathroom bin has no lid).The small amount of dirt was (hopefully) squashed and smeared insects both in the bathroom and on the blackout blind. The blackout blind was very effective.The hotel did not suffer from traffic noise, but if you are sensitive to noise, get a room away from the lifts, as you can hear other people talking as they go back to their rooms.The decor was beauiful, and the staff attentive - unless you wanted something more complicated than help using the lift. Overall though, at that price, I would expect the room to be spotless and for them to be able to cater to a feather allergy better and quicker. Other luxury hotels are clearly aware of the problem and cater to it more efficiently and appealingly.

<Content>got what I paid for I stayed here for 1 night when on business and so I booked the cheapest room available - and I got what I paid for. Others suggest upgrading and perhaps you could consider that is this is to be a special holiday. I was in rm 1607 which was right next to the lifts (no noise) and at the back of the hotel - no real view - except over the street, other blds and construction site.I suppose the building is really old and the room must been the original size - really small! I've had bigger rooms in Japan! the king bed had barely any room around it. At least the decor was modern and fresh and quality.The wall with the window had the desk and TV cabinet built in. the TV had lots of cable channels but I had to get the technician in twice as it suffered the blue screen of death.the bed was very comfy but the pillows were uncomfy duck feather no support type - fortunately House keeping provided a foam pillow on request. They had that doona in a sheet thing that is becoming popular - but WAY too hot. I ran the A/C down to 16 degrees and then had the too cold to not be covered, too hot under the doona situation. Ordinary Sheets Please!! The entrance hall had the mini bar cabinet - all very nice - but no coffee machine. Cupboard had safe, ironing board, bathrobe, luggage rack etc The entrance hall was teeny - had troubles opening the door and letting room service in - I couldn't work out how I was going to open the door whilst holding the tray to put it out again - impossible.The bathroom had these teeny doors - nice marble room - good towels, great selection of good quality toiletries, magnifying mirror, etc just all on the small scale.Then the next morning when getting ready all the lights went out in my room and the technician had to come up and reconnect me. I had breakfast in the buffet - which was the worst part - outrageously expensive and the selection was very average - basically for the price I've had gourmet brekkies in other places. Also there were not enough tables so there was a long queue and wait for a table; and a long queue for the chap making the eggs, and a wait to bring the tea etc - very slow and not particularly great. I had dinner the night before from room service and that was good! a little bit expensive - but very good quality, large serving, delivered in average time and enjoyed.All up I think I spent too much time interacting with a variety of hotel staff. they all came quickly and were very pleasant, achieved the aim but I should not have met 3 technicians in a 1 night stay.I went to a conference in the hotel and the conference room was fine - the A/C was a bit cold, the food was fine and plentiful etc

<Content>Not what we expected The Sofitel Sydney was a bit of a letdown. The rooms were small, no views and construction noise to keep us awake. The other big issue was housekeeping which was very hit and miss. On the plus side the concierge service was very good, helpful at arranging transfers and giving directions. The breakfast was very disappointing with limited selection and average quality. We also found the reception staff unhelpful and not particularly friendly

<Content>Great start to our honeymoon Having just got married (for the 2nd time) my new wife and I had booked a 13 night cruise for our honeymoon.We flew into Sydney the day before and stayed the night pre-cruise at the Sofitel Wentworth.I had booked through the Accor website as an Advantage Plus member and thought that I'd splurge a little and stay in a Club Sofitel room.It's not often that my expectations are exceeded when it comes to hotels but in this case they most certainly were.We arrived by taxi and were warmly greeted at the entrance, luggage was quickly whisked away and we were escorted to the comfort of the Club Lounge for private check in by a very friendly young Frenchman.Within a very short time we were in our room (luggage was already there) and to our delight realised that we had been upgraded to a Club Suite with bubbly and petit fours on arrival compliments of the management on our recent marriage.The 15th floor suite was just lovely and very clean and modern with (of course) separate lounge and large marble bathroom with Roger and Gallet toiletries.The Sofitel My Bed is just divine and guarantees a good night's sleep.Club inclusions were : complimentary Lenotre afternoon tea,pre-dinner drinks and canapes,and of course,full buffet breakfast. Even when I couldn't see something that I wanted (pancakes with maple syrup and cream) I simply asked if it was possible and they made it happen.I liked the several large plasma screens dotted throughout the lounge and the wait staff were ultra friendly at all times.We were so impressed with what we saw,we shelved our plans to see Sydney at night and stayed in.The lobby was just lovely and very inviting and my wife just adored the flower arrangements.At every turn we encountered a friendly staff member...from the valet to the doorman,waitresses to cleaners...nothing was too much trouble and all with a big smile...how lovely!If this is how they treat their guests worldwide then I can't see any reason why I would stay anywhere else other than Sofitel.

<Content>Fantastic! I stayed at the Sofitel Wentworth in December 2007 for 2 nights, what a fantastic experience. The lobby was stunning, the staff extremely attentive and very very helpful, our bags were taken to our room while we went to explore the city. Our room was moderm and tasteful, clean and the fact that we had a room with a juliet balcony made our stay much more memorable, I must admit being able to open a window in your room and stand out on a balcony, small but perfectly suitable, is a great bonus.I am bemused by people that comment about the hotel not having a view, since when do you come to Sydney to sit in your hotel room and look out the window? The hotel is older from the outside, yet inside it is one of the most elegant hotels I have stayed at. Much better than the Sofitel in my home town of Melbourne. Would definately go back and next time choose one of the Club Rooms. Highly recommended.

<Content>French Indulgence without going to Paris ! Stayed at the Wentworth for a significant birthday and wanted somewhere special. We had reserved a Club room and on arrival were upgraded to a Junior Suite (but in hindsight the Junior Suite was facing the rear and a construction site with noise so would have prefered the Club room). Check-in staff were very courteous and whisked us straight up to the Level 5 club where you have a seperate check-in. We got a quick tour around the sofitel club as well as afternoon teas, evening drinks and breakfasts are all included here.The room was excellent with two TVs, well appointed bathroom and all facilities you expect of a five star hotel. The bed and pillows were the highlight and easily the most comfortable we've ever experienced and 'triangle pillows' appeared in our room within minutes of the request. On the negative, there was a welcome note for another guest with a piece of old fruit on the desk that had not been removed.We loved the club experience as we spent most of our time at the hotel. The Lenotre afternoon teas were delicious and tempting and so petite that you didn't feel guilty indulging. We drank enough fine teas over the 4 day stay to sink a ship. The canapes and two hours free drinks that come with club access were another highlight and the canapes were of a very high standard and it's amazing how many glasses of champagne you can drink in two hours ! Staff in the club were exceptional and clearly of a standard not seen in Australia. Most were European, several French and we only noticed one Australian. Agree with other reviewers that paying the extra for club access is almost essential here as our review would be different if we had not. There is not much the hotel can do about the building site with construction noise (and we could have requested a move) but the noise is disconcerting and quite loud. Dinner at the Garden Court was incredible with a price to match but the standard of service and quality of food was extr emely high. My wife said she's never tasted oysters so good, We had an accor card so got half price food but even with that Dinner for two and a wine flight came to $140. Bottles of water were charged at $10 eachThe recent renovations are obvious and the public areas and rooms all look wonderful. If you want a view or a a swimming pool in your hotel then go elsewhere but if you want a high quality experience in the heart of the CBD this will do the job. We had a great stay and next time will know to request a room away from the construction site !

<Content>Luxury in the heart of a bustling city This is the first time we've stayed at the Sofitel in Sydney. Being Accor privilege members, we have stayed at numerous Sofitel hotels throughout the world and Sydney was one that did not dissapoint. The furniture was well appointed and was furnished with taste. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't have a view of the harbour due to its locations but don't let this point get you down. Some of the other reviews commented on noise issues but we definitely didn't encounter any. The staff went well and beyond to help with luggage held for the day, thorough instructions to get to shopping destinations, the correct buses to hop on/off etc.Breakfast was pretty good in terms of Sofitel standards.The location was perfect in terms of buses to the Paddington shops and Bondi Beach. It was just a short walk (about 100m to the bus stop).We'll definitely make a stop here again for a weekend.

<Content>Great service We stayed at this hotel to mark a special occasion. We arrived early but the room was available. We were pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to a junior suite. The service provided at the desk was wonderful and this was followed up with a gift in the room.The hotel is older than some but has been beautifully decorated and has a warm comfortable feel.Location is very central for both business and pleasure travellers.All in all we could not fault the hotel or the wonderful service.

<Content>Not 5* unless pay for Club rooms! As other reviewers have indicated, unless you are willing to pay for a Club room, this hotel is not 5*.This is compounded by the lack of a pool and an 'indpendent' in-house gym (which closes at 12pm on Sat and Sun!).Also beware that there is currently a very large demolition project underway directly opposite the standard room windows - nothing like window panes shaking all day to take the already dulled gloss completely off the experience.Breakfast was underwhelming, and not just because it was $40.Normally stay at Sheraton-on-the-Park, but was full at the rate I normally book. Will definitely go for the next rate up at Sheraton next time (which will work out cheaper than a Club room at the Wentworth anyway!).

<Content>Just the Best!!! We have previously stayed at the Sofitel Wentworth, however their recent refurbishment, including the Sofitel Club is quite spectacular.We normally book Club Floors so as have access to the Clubs for breakfast etc..... and this visit proved to be the Best Experience ever.We were directed to the Club to check in - which was ever so pleasant and welcoming, nothing a problem, welcome drink in hand, shown around the new club facilities etc etc etc....Fabulous room as well, and the service impecable.so much so that this would have to be our favourite Hotel now with a far Superior Club service than what we have ever ever received. Top Marks!!

<Content>Fantastic the Second Time round!! I stayed at the Sofitel in December, 2007 and was less than impressed. However, I decided to give the hotel a second chance in May, 08 and I'm so very glad I did! The members of staff that I encountered could not have been more polite, helpful and courteous. The hotel has really improved in this area and cannot be faulted. The GM, Simon Harris should be commended for these efforts. The atsmosphere was very pleasant and welcoming. The hotel room was clean, well lit  beautiful and in-room noise has never been an issue for me. The blackout blinds are excellent!I enjoyed another fantastic buffet breakfast, consuming my body weight in Latte's and omelettes. lolI have found most 5 star hotels in Sydney to be quite similar, but the staff at the Sofitel make all the difference. Well Done.

<Content>A Very Comfortable Stay Stayed at the Sofitel Wentworth over the Easter weekend in a Club room and was delighted by all aspects during my stay. From check-in to when it was time to leave, each staff member I encountered was thoroughly gracious, very friendly and more than helpful, which helped to make the weekend away most enjoyable. The intoxicating scent of lavender and ylang ylang in the lobby was a precursor to the wonderful facilities provided on the Club Level and to a very comfortable, well appointed room with a good sized, very clean, modern bathroom. The bed was so wonderfully luxurious, it was hard to leave! I slept very well indeed. I highly recommend this hotel and would strongly suggest staying in a Sofitel Club room as the use of the Club lounge certainly made all the difference,

<Content>Good Club Lounge and Staff Stayed in a Club Room here on Friday night. Hotel has recently been renovated and a new Club Lounge created since our last stay (approx 6 months ago).Likes- Very friendly and accomodating staff especially James who was excellent and always smiling even when struggling with out large suitcases!- Great restaurant for dinner (Garden Court), food was excellent and particularly liked the extensive list of water available- Attractively designed Club Room with good quality food and beverages- The Sofitel bedDislikes- The renovated rooms still have the shallow old bath and low water pressure- No poolOverallI thought this was a hotel well worth staying in. The Club Lounge could expand it's food and beverage range slightly but no real complaints. Staff were friendly, professional and very helpful

<Content>highly recommended This hotel may be expensive, but it's worth it. A beautifully designed building in a quiet part of downtown, with Circular Quay and the main shopping areas a short walk away. Front desk and room service staff were very helpful. The fire alarm went off while we were there and by the time we had taken the steps to street level, they had identified that it was a false alarm. All the staff was informative, calm, and professional during the crisis.The business center was small, but did not charge me for printing, nor did the front desk charge me for sending an international fax. The room was clean and simple. Some might say sparse, but I'd rather not be surrounded by cheap graphic prints. Bathroom was great, it even had a fogless mirror!The breakfast is expensive, but worth it - everything was fresh, and there was lots of it. The staff gives you newspapers and doesn't try to rush you through your meal.I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Most beautiful Club Lounge I have ever seen I am a big fan of Sofitel in Asia and the US so it was natural for me to consider this property while spending 7 nights in Sydney recently. The Hotel was built in the 1960's and can be considered a landmark in the city. It is a nice walk to the harbour and next to great shopping and restaurants. The hotel was completely renovated recently and the rooms (I stayed in a suite) are tastfully furnished although I am not a big fan of blond wood finishes. The fabrics and linens are excellent. The bathroom is a bit too small.The highlight of the hotel is Le Club lounge, which is available to guests at an extra cost. The finish and design of this lounge is absolutely beautiful. It is spacious and has a side array of snacks and drinks throughout the day, including champagne and fine wines. It has many different kinds of seating, so it was enjoyable at breakfast (with big flatscreens tuned to the local news and plenty of newspapers) and superb coffee. The staff is no doubt a notch above the rest of the hotel in this venue. I visited several othe hotels while I was in Sydney for various meetings and the selection is excellent. None of the other properties have this kind of experience, however.The reason why I rate this hotel only at 4 is because it had a poor selection of tv channels and $29/day internet. Do you believe that BBC and CNN are not available? I watched local news for a week and got international news off my blackberry and online. Of course, I paid the $29/day for the internet (on top of my $550 room rate), but I think this is a bit over the top. Maybe this is severe to complain about but I like many frequesnt travellers are fed up with this fee and go nuts when it is so extreme.

<Content>Don't miss dinner We stayed in the Wentworth for one night in February 2008. The staff are friendly and helpful even if they greet you in French, I suppose to accentuate the French Accor Group ownership of the chain. The room was clean and modern but we felt small for this level and price of hotel. The bathroom was very small and did not have a bath only a shower. When I mentioned the size of the room it was explained as being a 鈥渉eritage鈥?building which restricted alterations that could be made.The buffet breakfast in the Garden Court Restaurant was underwhelming and the impression we got was that they just could not cope.In the evening dinner at the same restaurant was sublime, such a change from breakfast time. The service was impeccable, the knowledgeable and friendly staff always seemed to be there when you wanted them. The food was some of the best that we have eaten in Sydney. We especially recommend the scallops, had to ask for extra bread so we did not miss a drop of the delicious sauce. The meal was finished with crepe suzette flamb茅ed at the table, a treat not offered in many restaurants these days.So to sum up the Sofitel Wentworth in Sydney, small rooms, give the breakfast buffet a miss but even if you are not staying there go for dinner.

<Content>An Experience to Remember As a first time visitor to Australia, I was impressed with kindness of the people and with the Sofitel. Upon entering the lobby, there is a wonderful smell which I found out was lavender and ylang-ylang. The reception was so kind and gave us all kind of tips for enjoying Aussie in it's true form. We wanted a reservation for our anniversary and asked the Concierge of he could get us one at Icebergs? He tried really hard and was unable to, so they sent us a bottle of chilled wine on our anniversary. A nice touch. My only complaint was the pillows smelled of mold, like they had been wet and weren't properly dried. But they brought new ones quickly and we were ok after that. I wasn't bothered at all by the noise. We could hear the trash trucks in the morning, but you really had to listen for them. Maybe it was because we were on the courtyard side. I would recommend the Sofitel without hestiation and we are already planning to return to Sydney and will be staying there.

<Content>Club Sofitel very special After just reading the other reviews, I am pleased I was there during the week, as even then the street noise was noticeable on a Wednesady as it seems to bounce around the hotel (semi-circlular shape).Apart from that the Club Sofitel lounge is definitely something that you should experience. Personal check-in, tea/coffee and softdrinks all day, then champagne and canapes from 1730-1930, and a beautiful peaceful breakfast in the Sofitel lounge. The standard of food was exceptional and the service impeccable in the lounge.The only gripe I have is the standard of the rooms. Travelling alot with work, this is certaily not the usual Sofitel 5 star standard (even staying on the Club Sofitel floors). Rooms were smallish and quite plain, which was dissappointing.Would stay again if just for the Club Sofitel experience.

<Content>Hotel was great but the NOISE!! We stayed in one of the suites at the sofitel. The suite was lovely. Club sofitel was fab. It was all good till we tried to go to sleep...At about 10:30pm (on a Saturday), dance music from a bar down on Bligh St started. We were on the 11th floor but still the noise floated straight up and we may as well have been lying in bed on the dancefloor. At about midnight, after staring at the ceiling for for a few hours, I called reception. They said that it should get better soon.At 1am, the club shut the doors where the bar was open to the street . The noise was muffled but there was no mistaking that thumping bass. I fiinally went to sleep at 4am when the bar closed. So my tip is, don't stay there on the weekend unless you can stay on the Philip St side. We booked through a last minute site so got a great rate. I couldn't help but wonder if thats why we were in that location.

<Content>Awful I stayed one Friday night here - the room and bathroom were incredibly small (only slighhtly larger than one in the Hotel Formule 1 chain, and you expect them to be small for the price).Also the NOISE was awful , from the pub on the ground floor ( I was on the 14th floor but still heard everything until 2am) The reception staff qucikly brought up ear plugs when I complained ?a common eventWould NEVER stay there again

<Content>Don't take room *07 or *08 Stayed 3 nights in this hotel. 1st night unfortunately in a room next to the lift - there are 4 lifts in the liftwell and the outside 2 which are next to the bedrooms *07  *08 seem to be programmed to be the 1st call so they are up and down all night. They can be heard inside the rooms. Spoke to deskstaff the next morning and was moved immediately - upgraded with an apology. Other than this problem the hotel was excellent.

<Content>I love this hotel Lovely lobby with really pretty flower arrangements which scent the area. Charming reception staff. Rooms smallish, modern and very clean, with effective blackout blinds, and soft high quality beds and bedding. AC silent and effective. Breakfast buffet excellent, room service delicious and promptly served. Concierge very knowlegable and helpful. The building is an architecturally significant ex office building which has been clevely converted. The area is in the CBD with a five minute walk to The Rocks, and shopping areas near Pitt Street.The hotel have an arrangement witha Parisian pattisserie and the desserts are amazing and world class.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed at Sofitel Wentworth during Easter this year. It was without a doubt a fantastic experience. The hotels atmosphere was lovely. The room itself was furnished elegantly and the bed was very comfortable. Housekeeping did an excellent job and were helpful in any extra requests we had such as blankets. The staff were very pleasant and even suggested places for us to go. The location itself was great, only a short stroll to Circular Quay.The hotels restaurant IS A MUST. The food there was just exquisite. I cant remember the name of the chef but he is french and has added his own flair and experience to the restaurant at the sofitel and it shows. I highly recommend eating there.All in all, a lovely hotel and we will definately return :-)

<Content>Love The Wentworth I travel a lot for business and i have recently experienced the new Qantas first lounge - here i learnt that Sofitel manage this amazing product and decided to experience their hotel in Sydney, The Wentworth. Unfortunately, they were refurbushing their restaurant, but the new designs look great. The overall stay was far superior than my previous hotel - The Hilton, which quite simply - rubbish. The staff seemed more refined and the reception staff were professional and knowledgable about their hotel and city. Housekeeping were prompt and my room was always serviced before i got back at 3pm. Am certainly staying here again and will try the other Sofitels soon. ps: if you join Sofitel Privilege Club (which is free), you get free acess to theor health club.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Good Location I stayed at the Sofitel for a week long business trip.Room was clean and very nicely appointed with a comfortable bed, nice furnishings and small decorative touches. Hotel staff was courteous and friendly. All in all I had a very comfortable stay.The Circular Quay is just a couple blocks away and walking to any area such as the Pitt Street Mall, Darling Harbor, Hyde Park or the Rocks was only 10-15 min away.On the downside鈥?the hotel has limited amenities outside of just nice rooms and good restaurant. The worst is the high cost of Internet access. When will international hotels start providing free access like they do in the States?

<Content>Attentive and comfortable We ended up here after a short-notice trip to Sydney. The staff are attentive without being intrusive and try to please. We were offered a room for three (2 adults, 1 child - 10yo) which only had a king bed. When we pointed out it wasn't possible to sleep three in that, we we given a rollaway bed at no extra charge.The staff paid particular attention to our daughter, treating her as much as a guest as my wife and I.I would definitely stay again.

<Content>WOW - Service is amazing WOW - this hotel has amazing service. I recently stayed at Radisson but it was full on this occasion, so I stayed at the Sofitel which is just a short distance away - still well located. The hotel rooms are really comfortable and they overlook a courtyard which looked like a great place to have a drink, but I found out that their restaurant was under construction - nonetheless I had a drink in their lobby bar. Throughout my stay (4 days) the staff were just amazing - they seemed so happy and pleased to be working there - what a credit to management - best overall service i have ever received.

<Content>Very good, for a one stop trip to Sydney Staff were brilliant at reception, arrvd at about 7a.m. from New Zealand, and the room was ready. It was great that we did not have to spend hours filling in the time after an early start. Location is super, a stones throw from the Opera House. And access to most Sydney has to offer. Room nice and neat and really comfortable.

<Content>Great stay at the Sofitel The Sofitel Wentworth is a lovely place to stay right in the heart of Sydney. A stroll away from the Opera House and Circular Quay, a stones throw away from the shopping district.Right from the check in the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. We were in room 1114 which was a junior suite. Given some of the slightly negatvice reviews here I was a little apprehensive as this was an important occasion for my wife and I. I shouldn't have worried!The lounge area was skinny but well appointed, furnishings were all of a very high quality. The bedroom was a good size with a very classy feel, features included; a beautiful timber wardrobe/entertainment unit, side tables with an ambient night light which was a thoughtful inclusion, last but not least the bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept in. The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with seperate shower and bath, nice marble finishes were all appreciated.Food in the restaurant was excellent and again the staff were professional and the service could not be faulted.There may be hotels in Sydney which have a better view of the Harbour etc, and there may be hotels which offer larger rooms, however for what the hotel offers, you would have to be really nit picking or have suffered an unfortunate experience to rate this hotel less than 5 out of 5.

<Content>Great business hotel I travel to Sydney often from LA and my company has a pre-selected range of hotels to use in Sydney - quite frankly they are OK. but I overheard someone in the UA lounge talking about the Sofitel brand so i thought i would try it in Sydney. The hotel has a boutique feel (tick) with a great interior design - really soft colors - but maked me feel right at home (tick). The beds are really comfortable (tick) and i thick they call them my beds. The service was efficient and I had guest relations always greeting me every morning as i was leaving the hotel. Would really have to say this is one of the best business hotels i have ever used.

<Content>Room not up to snuff for Sofitel brand Poorly designed room - virtually no storage space for your clothes. No chest of drawers or armoire. Limited closet space was taken up by the safety deposit box, ironing board and luggage rack. Two bathrobes took up further space, leaving only 3-4 hangers for your clothes, while the shelf above was too high to be used and, in any event, was filled with extra pillows and blankets. Minute corner shelves were filled with an iron and a shoe mitt. Every day I had to unpack my suitcase and repack everything in the AM, as there was nowhere else to put my clothes!Lots of wasted space in the room. Built-in bookshelves contained glass vases, which took up valuable space that could have been used for drawer space. Mirrors behind the shelves and on the wall facing the bed were disconcerting to look at. You felt as if you were sleeping in someone's living room, not a hotel room. Roll-up window blinds took forever to roll up or down - there were two layers, so it took twice as long. The TV was placed at a perpendicular angle on one of the bookshelves (on the side of the room), so you had to twist your neck to watch TV in the evening.Lots of sharp edges in the room, particularly the cabinets housing the barware and mini-fridge. Watch your elbows!Bathroom has lots of granite, but little counter space. Hand/face towels, glasses and hotel toiletries took up most of the limited counter space. Barely enough room to put down your toothbrush. Shower stall had two plastic soap holders - obviously dysfunctional, as a third metal shelf was added to hold the soap, shampoo, etc., but the metal shelf still jutted out at a downward angle, causing the shampoo to fall off - and you had to be careful not to scrape your elbow against the shelf. If you turned the shower head away from the shelf, you risked leaking water outside the shower stall. There is no ventilation in the bathroom, so if you wish to do hand laundry, it is pointless to hang it on the clothesline in the stall, as the door bumps into the clothesline if you leave it open, so you must close the door and shut off all air to the wet clothes. You could try leaving the glass shower door partially open, but you might accidentally walk into the door if you want to use the toilet in the middle of the night.The queen size bed is actually two twin beds joined together, so have fun sleeping in the middle of the crack. Also, the left side of the bed sagged terribly - too many heavy people have evidently left their mark on this bed.Finally, the hotel is located in the central business district, which is DEAD at night. Nowhere interesting to dine (except for the Bligh restaurant, which apparently belongs to the family that manages the Sofitel).Overall, this stay was a huge disappointment, and whoever designed the interiors fell far short of the goal of customer satisfaction. I will not stay here again.

<Content>Value light I booked the top Accor hotel in Sydney for my mother visiting from England, to ensure we had a good time. So we were disappointed when the little things kept going wrong. The rooms were nice and comfortable, if a little cramped. And the views no longer exisit as the hotel has been completely dwarfed on all sides by office blocks, so close I could read posters on their office walls.Initially we were delivered to the wrong room, which was corrected within 20 minutes. The staff were very obliging and friendly.Room service was so asleep. Still jet lagged we ordered some missing spoons and some fresh milk about 5am, which never arrived even after a reminder an hour later. A later request met with an incredibly long wait, so we gave up trying anymore.Dinner in the hotel is restricted to the only (open style) restaurant, with prices to match the 5star impression, but the fare was quite goodOn check-out it took about 40 minutes to locate our car in the car park and bring it up, at a reasonably quiet time of the day.There are better value for the money locations in Sydney, even though this is centrally located and well established.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Great service. Hotel staff helped us out with everything from umbrellas when it rained to booking tours to locating hard-to-find shops. Rooms were well decorated and clean. Location is within walking distance from key tourist attractions (The Rocks, Sydney Opera House, Circular Quay) and shopping malls on Pitt Street and Castlereagh.

<Content>Highly recommend. Stayed 3 nights in January 2007, on a breakfast included rate.Got the usual 'Sotitel privilege card' advantages (complimentary Evian  Perrier bottles, strawberries, chocolate mousse, etc. were waiting for us in our room on arrival) and I highly recommend taking this (free) card.Very nice hotel, perfectly located, with small but top notch room.Breakfast buffet with comprehensive food and drink offerings, among which some sophisticated items.Many French (or French speaking) employees.Only complaint : some TV channels sometimes unavailable (called maintenance but it was not our TV set fault, major hotel problem with antenna...).

<Content>An enjoyable stay in the end I stayed at the Sofitel for Valentine's Day with my partner for 2 nights. Check-in was pretty smooth and easy; although when we walked into our room, we were a bit shocked to see how small it was (we were given a standard room even though we had booked a superior room). It wasn't until I woke up the next day that I realised we were probably given the wrong room type. I didn't make a fuss on the first day because I'm so used to small hotel rooms in Asia and didn't think at the time we were given the wrong room type.I decided to take charge and approached the front desk and asked why they didn't provide me with the correct room type. The lady looked into the system and said they cancelled the upgrade yesterday because they were fully booked. I then mentioned that I had booked the hotel months in advance (December) and the fact that the cancellation of the upgrade was not communicated to me at check-in. The lady promptly went to see the Duty Manager and 2 minutes later, we were upgraded for free on our second night to a Deluxe Suite. What a nice touch! I was thoroughly impressed.The Deluxe Suite is a world's difference to the standard room. The furnishings were very modern and tasteful, and the bathroom was very luxurious. In fact, they use the exact shower head that I have at home (although I have much better water pressure at home). The Sofitel MyBed is truly wonderful, particular the pillows and linen - incredibly soft and comfortable. I'm going to try and see if I can order some! The room service deluxe burger was also very nice, although the Sofitel signature pizza was a bit dry. The views from the room were nothing to write home about, but I didn't stay there for the view and I liked that the opera house was only 5 minutes away by foot. Also, for those that don't know, one should apply for the Sofitel Privilege Card (it's free) which entitles you to a late check out at 4pm (extremely useful). We were also provided 4 large bottles of complimentary water and free drink vouchers at the lounge which I thought were nice touches. In terms of the lobby area, there really wasn't anything grand about it (which was disappointing because I like my grand hotel lobbies). Very different to the Sofitel Melbourne (where we stay for new years).Overall, it was a great stay in the end and I did enjoy my stay at the Sofitel; although I might give another place a try next time (maybe one of the Amex Platinum FHR hotels which will also give late checkouts).

<Content>Huge dissapointment for a Sofitel Hotel After disembarking on a cruise (on which we were thorougly spoiled) my husband and I were expecting more of the same service during our stay in Sydney when we checked in to the Sofitel Wentworth for two nights. Checkin was courteous and prompt, but the room was disappointing - walls were grubby with lots of scuff marks (not a good standard for a Sofitel) the furnishings overall are not in keeping with what one normally expects of a Sofitel no quality in the finishes, window coverings are blinds which are very impractical one redeeming feature the bed was comfortable though there was no turn down service with the little chocolate on the pillow - like housekeeping this must be another service that has been cut back.Requested assistance from concierge to make a reservation for a show - and even though we had a $10 tip in our hand to give him - we were directed out onto the street to make our own reservation at the Ticket shop. Tried to dine in the hotel restaurant on a Friday evening as it is open plan the noise level from the adjoing bar area which was in full swing with pre-Christmas parties was horrendous and since they only have one inhouse restaurant had to go by taxi to Darling Harbour to dine. Had similar problem on the Saturday night, could not dine inhouse as they were fully booked and with no other inhouse restaurant had to again take taxi to go to Darling Harbour to dine. Should have stayed in Darling Harbour, where the restaurants are superb, and THE Sofitel Wentworth did not live up to the Sofitel standard.

<Content>Good value for money The Hotel is really close to all major attractions: the Rocks, Opera House and Circular Quay where you can also catch bus to Bondi Beach. We stayed for two nights at a Superior King bedroom which was comfortable and cosy. Our rate did non included breakfast - and it is relatively expensive (35$pp) -, we've walked to the nearby Museum Coffe House - cca. two blocks toward Circular Quay -, they serve hot breakfast which was superb and cost only 36$ for two persons.The hotel has no pool or any view in particular compared to nearby Marriott, Shangri-La, Intercontinental or Four Seasons but you can excpect a good quality, recently refurbished hotel, at excellent location in Sydney at a reasonable price.Check out the hotel website, they offer good promotional rates also.Good value for money.

<Content>Not bad --could do better We're from Sydney and stayed overnight after a nearby function. The staff were friendly (some perhaps inexperienced) and the room comfortable if a bit small. The view is not great --but doesn't pretend to be. When combined with some minor things --old towels, room service breakfast later than ordered, difficulty getting bags from the car, not being able to ask for the car to be ready when leaving etc -- meant to us that it was fine but not spectacular. We think there are better hotels, particularly those with great views for tourists if they are in your price range. However, when you can get this considerably cheaper than some of the opposition, it might be worth it. We got a last minute rate from the hotel itself that was a little cheaper even than the usual last minute sites.

<Content>Not a bad hotel We stayed in a twin room and the room size was quite small. There was not much space to place our luggage in the room. We requested to change the room because the first room we were allocated was very dusty and a bit stuffy as if it was unused for a long time. The second room was a bit better.The water pressure of the showers are quite weak for hotel standards. There are also no bathtubs in the bathroom.Their housekeeping is quite inefficient as we called to ask them to bring up some slippers and cotton pads, but it usually takes a few phone calls before they respond. Don't bother calling housekeeping at night (i.e. after 10pm) as they will never come.The location of the hotel is not bad as it's close to The Rocks and Circular Quays. It's also within walking distance to the main shopping areas. There aren't many restaurants nearby for dinner at night so you would either have to walk a bit further or catch a taxi to other places.The service at the concierge is excellent. One of the staff called Travis was especially helpful. We would always go through our itinerary for the day with him in the morning so he can give us advice. He also recommended a few good restaurants for dinner at night and called to make our reservations for us.It's not a bad hotel for the price and location and I would stay there again although I have heard that the Marriot nearby is even better.

<Content>Great stay in Sydney My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Wentworth at the end of September. Sydney was our first stop. After flying across the U.S. and then overseas to Sydney, we were ready for a good night's sleep. The Sofitel Wentworth was fantastic! We like Sofitel hotels and were not disappointed. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had a Superior room (1 level above a Standard room) - it was a bit bigger than the standard room and was only a few dollars/night more. The room was a decent size and comfortable. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in. The bathroom was a good size as well. The hotel toilettries were fantastic (L'Occitane). We did not find the room to be too small and we had a nice view off our balcony. The location of the hotel is great. It's in a safe area. It was an easy walk to the Circular Quay and we also were in walking distance of Darling Harbor, the Pitt Street Mall, the Sydney Tower and the Queen Victoria Building. We didn't take any taxis while in Sydney.I recommend getting the Sofitel Loyalty card. It's free to sign up and they offer some discounts. Because of the card, we had preferred check-in status and had the option to keep the room until 4pm on the day of check out. They also gave us fruit and a couple bottles of water in the room.I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Perfet location in Sydney vs deluxe hotels I had the opportunity to spend my holidays with some friends in Sydney, we did stay at SOFITEL WENTWORTH ; perfectly located in the city walking distance from everywhere (circular quay, opera, museum, shopping). Even if the hotel is a really business oriented, it fits to tourists looking to discover beautiful Sydney and surrounding. The rooms are large; well decorated, the associates are really professional (especially the concierge desk, all of them are really helpful and I do make a special note to their sense of service). From my point of view it is not worth to psend extras dollars to stay on Circular Quay as this hotel is not far away and looks as elegant as the Four Seasons and much better that Shangri-La (OK, you don't have a view ...). A tip for other leisure fellow who would like to stay at this hotel, the breakfasts are quite expensive (nice buffet) , you just cross the street and go to Chifley square, there you will find a cafe-restaurant callesAVENUE on Chifley , the quality is outstanding and the staff and owners very nice, smiling and welcoming and the prices half !

<Content>Great Service We stayed at this hotel for the first stop of our honeymoon. We arrived at 6am after 23 hours flying not expecting to be able to check in. However, the check in staff were amazing and not only did they check in but upgraded us to a suite. The suite was lovely (a little small) but had separate lounge with TV and desk and then bedroom with another TV and a huge bathroom with separate bath and huge powerful shower. The only downsides were that there were no nice views from the rooms but you would pay a lot more for that!!!

<Content>Not what I expected unfortunately. After booking in for business travel I was given a small rooom with barely enough space to walk around the queen size bed. Not very luxurious with regular TV etc (no flat sceen), and no view from the 6th floor. I requested a better room and was given a room on the top floor right next to the elevators, which were noisy and disturbed my sleep. After requesting a room change again I was given another average room by front desk staff who seem reluctant to help.As far as deluxe hotels go this place is really quite average - I think there are many better 5* hotels out there.

<Content>Very nice place For the money, I think the Sofitel is probably the best place to stay in all of Sydney (a statement that will probably lead to this hotel becoming just as expensive as its competitors!)Anyhow, we considered the Establishment or the Four Seasons, but they were both at least a third more money, and in hindsight are confident were not worth the extra money.The common areas (lobby, hallways, etc.) are top-notch, as good as you'd find pretty much anywhere save Mandarin Oriental.We stayed in a Superior room (upgraded at check-in), and it was VERY nice. The rooms are definitely on the small side, but not overly so, and they are well-appointed. Regardless, I would take a small nice room over a large unattractive one anyday. The circular-shaped bathroom was very nicely done, but I will say the tub/shower combination with its half-shower door was a bit awkward.The breakfast was really good. It's a bit pricey (32 AUS, I think), but in line with what you'd expect to pay at a place like this, and they really put out quite a spread and with excellent service. I will say there was a bit of street noise in our room and we asked to switch to a higher floor, but I didn't like the layout of the new room as much so we stayed put. Overall, a few flaws, but a very nice hotel and one I'd recommend.

<Content>great room, great location... The room was great, had a King Sized bed, flat screen tv. No view but the room made up for it. Great location - could walk to Circular Quay quite easily. Staff was great too.Only problem was the noise of the hallway - the door was not soundproof and I could hear all the noise - including a loud tour group that had just arrived late at night.

<Content>Constant elevator noise Great staff and nice rooms in good downtown location. 5 star ratings apparently don't consider the noise factor, though. A design flaw in the recent upgrade has ductwork passing through the elevator shaft and through to the rooms. That ductwork conveys the noises to the rooms 24/7 ! When I asked for a room change because of the noise (and we were several rooms away from the shaft), I was told the noise goes to ALL the rooms!

<Content>5 + star service from 4 star hotel We stayed at several hotels in sydney for various reasons amongst them would be the siebel pier one, the sofitel wentworth, and the four seasons. The siebel pier one I would not reccomend to anyone, overpriced 3 star hotel. The Sofitel although not quite the same as the four seasons, gives it a good run for the money. Costs less than the siebel pier one but 5 + star treatment. Excellent service, excellent rooms, excellent location, great hotel and great price. Could not fault it in anyway.

<Content>Highly recommended We stayed at the Sofitel Sydney for four nights, and we highly recommend it. The staff was excellent, the room was elegant, and the breakfast was great. It is an high class hotel that would is appropriate for both business and tourist stays. We booked a weekend rate on their website that was very reasonable.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Nice Location, Tiny Room We stayed in this hotel the last weekend of November 2005. We arrived from the tropical north in shorts and tshirts, and felt VERY underdressed. The main lobby is very ornate and sophisticated. The hotel itself is located in the CBD (central business district), and so if you arrive during the week (as we did) most people around are in suits.The check-in process was quick (we had made our reservations through wotif), and bellhop took our bags when we arrived at the front doors, and proceeded to take them up to our room when we were ready.This royal treatment set us up for a bit of a let-down when we saw the room itself - it was tiny. The bed was comfortable (unless you wanted to sleep in the center), but was obviously two twin beds that had been made into one larger bed. The tv recessed into an alcove. The floor to ceiling window looked out onto office buildings, and had a desk in front of it. The window had both blackout and sheer blinds to use. Next to the bed, on either side, were lighting controls - whole room, reading, night light. Nice touch.In the closet were two robes for our use, an iron and board, and an in-room safe. The bathroom was cramped. There was no space to hang our toiletry bags, the sink was huge, but it left little counter space for our toiletries. The toilet was fine, but the toilet paper holder was almost on the floor, making it difficult to use when needed. The shower/tub combination was poor. The shower didn't have much pressure, and after about 5 minutes, the temperature began to fluctuate wildly. The tub you stand in is very narrow - there is no way to stand with your legs apart unless you turn sideways.Sydney is very hilly - Circular Quay and The Rocks are about 5 minute walk away (downhill), and the main shopping area is about a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction.Any time we had a question about where to find something, or how to get to an area, the concierge was extremely helpful. They have wonderful maps, and will even lend you umbrellas if you need.

<Content>Excellent hotel.....fabulous lobby flowers My husband and I stayed for a weekend at this great hotel. The lobby had huge vases of lilies and orchids, plus smaller vases of orchids the scent was heaven to me. At night time the reception desk has welcoming (safe) tea lights. The room had a tiny balcony overlooking the courtyard garden, the bed was comfortable and everything was spotlessly clean. The IT gadgets such as phone and TV were state of the art. Two nights was not long enough to stay here. The food was good value too.
