<Content>Nothing fancy, but great service! We stayed in this hotel for the weekend of this year's Berlin Marathon. It was our first visit to Berlin and good hotels were hard to come by! This hotel had brilliant service and a very nice bar and restaurant on the ground floor. We thought that our bedroom was a little sub-par - definitely more three star than four star - and the air conditioning left a lot to be desired: our room was really stuffy.I wouldn't book this hotel for a romantic weekend away or anything, but as a base for exploring the city it would be fantastic - it's a couple of minutes' walk to the train (and Berlin's public transport is wonderful). Some reviews have slated the hotel breakfasts, but we found it to be absolutely fine! It was also great that the hotel staff obviously anticipated that a lot of their guests were in town to run the marathon - they had a big pasta buffet for dinner the night before, for example.

<Content>Made a good choice Stayed here a total of 7 nights with my husband. It was a good thing that a S-bahn station and not a U-bahn station is very nearby as we arrived in the middle of a strike by the public transport sector. Although the hotel is located on Storkower Stasse, the name of the S-bahn station is Landsberger Allee and it takes about 2-3 minutes on foot to get there. The hotel may not be in the centre but there is no problem getting to the major sights in Berlin. The room is of good size and comfortable. The housekeeping did a fantastic job as the room was spotless. We got good rates from the hotel's website (the hot deals) and we considered that to be a bargain. If you do not want to have breakfast at the hotel, there is a bakery shop just around the corner by the name of Kamps and a kebab shop. There is also a small supermarket and a One Euro shop at the basement of the Forum Landsberger which is in the same building as the Kamps and the hotel (though it is not connected). You will see a convenient store on the ground floor of Forum Landsberger but the one at the basement has more choices and the prices are better too. Service at the front desk was good as well. The only downside was that the internet charge was on the high side. But I guess that is the normal rate charged by hotels. All in all it was a good stay.

<Content>Nice hotel Stayed in this Hotel in May 2007 with tour group. The staff were very helpful. Bought transport ticket at front desk. Young guy on desk only to happy to give transport info and map. Tram across the road, as is train station. 10 minutes from Alexanderplatz. Plenty of places to eat near by. Had italian one night [ family run]and chinese another, both very reasonable. We were lucky to have a large corner suite {2 rooms} It was very clean and not too noisy even though it was overlooking the main street.

<Content>Better than expected but far from city centre The hotel, located in former East Berlin, is new, nice, clean and an excellent value for the money. It is also very close to, and well connected by public transportation to everywhere in Berlin including Schoenefeld airport.It is however not near to city centre: you would need to change at least two lines on the S-Bahn/U-bahn network or take a tram. Both rides take 25-30 minutes. Taxi may be faster depending on traffic but a ride to Mitte would be no less than 10 Euros making this quite unconvenient. Moreover, taxies are not readily available outside of the hotel: you may have to wait for some time to have one called by the very polite and efficient staff at peak hours or in bad weather.In the end, the hotel is a best choice if you use it only to sleep and get changed, or if you do not mind about commuting time between major attractions in Berlin and your room. If you wish to stay where action takes place you might think of treating yourself at a more centrally located option.

<Content>Loved Park Plaza The staff here were fantastic, the room was more than comfortable, the breakfast was lovely, and a lovely breakfast room, and the hotel restaurant was exceptional!!! Very clean, a really nice stay! Can't say anything bad about our time at Park Plaza Prenzlauer Berg Berlin. Fantastic location with the tram right outside the door, and close to main train line.

<Content>Very helpful and an nice place to stay 11 of us stayed here for a stag do, that was booked very cheaply. We were expecting something ok, but found this to be a delightful hotel in a nice area which was a quick taxi or tram ride into Mitte. The staff were very friendly and helpful and kept us supplied with beer.After booking for 10 we had an additional member to the party whom i phoned the hotel direct and he was added into one of the rooms without the slightest fuss.All in all, a great place to stay and Berlin is a must do city.You wont be dissappointed.

<Content>Weary Traveller Found Rest I was in Berlin at the end of a two-week book tour sponsored by my German publisher for my book Yiddishkeit: oder das eigene Leben (Secret Anniversaries of the Heart in the original English version) and wanted to be comfortable. It was hard getting someplace for the May 1 holiday weekend, and this was one of the few choices.I had an executive room with good minibar and soaking tub in the small bathroom. Having traveled extensively in Europe, I find a soaking tub a true luxury, even if it's not a luxus hotel. The side facing Storkowerstrasse is quieter than the other and I was at the end of the hallway and far away from the elevator. There's golden oldie music in the hallways and elevator that you can't hear inside your room. Sometimes it annoyed me, but often I found the 80s tunes a hilarious trip back in time.The room was cheerful and hip and I enjoyed my stay. I didn't realize right away that the arrow controls by the door were for the exterior light-damping window shades, so learn from my ignorance! :-). I've stayed elsewhere in Berlin and though this is not a scenic part of the city per se (though elsewhere in Prenzlauer Berg is hip and lovely), you get a feel for the old East Berlin which i find very suggestive, stimulating and intriguing as a writer. And the trips I made from there to Kreuzberg and back were really fascinating.The hotel food was good, though breakfast merely average. Staff was helpful whether I spoke German or English, though perhaps somewhat more so with the former. Cabs come amazingly quickly when called by the front desk.A special treat: a few doors down is a Bulgarian restaurant. Good food at reasonable prices.

<Content>New but smal rooms Stayed here in February, for business.The hotel is brand new, clean, in one of the main squares of Berlin next to the TV tower.Not tested the restaurant. Only problem i faced is that the room was very small. At the top of the hotel there is a casino, but you must ear a jacket and no jeans are allowed.

<Content>a real sleeper We booked a great 4-day package that included the breakfast buffet, one free dinner, an executive suite and a city tour bus. While the executive suite was ok, it certainly did not live up to American expectations for an accommodation so labelled. Nonetheless, the room was large and clean, although a bit in need of refurbishing. The breakfast buffet was simple, but more than adequate, particularly when included in the rate. The single dinner we had at the motel was nothing fancy, but well prepared. The bathroom was immaculate and the bed comfortable. While this hotel looks a bit inconvenient for the traveller, the S-Bahn circle route stops a half-block away, making it easy to get almost anywhere (use Landsberger stop). The real secret to a quick trip downtown was the use of the tram running down the middle of nearby Landsberger Allee - a straight shot to Alexander Platz, museums, etc. I can't imagine getting a better deal in Berlin for the money. The only drawback was the very expensive wireless internet service, but we found this to be the unfortunate norm in Germany.

<Content>Good Hotel Although a short journey outside of the city centre, this hotel makes a good base for people on a city break. As one of the other reviewers has said, it is in the east of the city, so is in amongst run-down blocks of flats and the views aren't very inspiring! But, don't be put off. It's very near to a train station and a tram stop, and a taxi journey to the Brandenburg Gate only costs around 拢8 (ask the receptionist to call a taxi for you). Make sure you write down the address of the hotel though, to show taxi drivers when you want to return to it, as there are TWO Park Plaza Hotels in Berlin (the other is the Park Plaza Wallstreet).On the whole we found the staff very efficient, but the levels of friendliness ranged from extremely friendly to not at all friendly! However, all of the staff spoke good English and were able to give us information on local events - we were there for the Berlin Marathon, and the staff were able to advise us about road blocks etc. The hotel was not totally what I was expecting - on its website, the communal areas sound much larger than they are! In reality, the bar is a tiny extension of the reception desk, and there are 3 or 4 tables with chairs round, then that's it (apart from the restaurant, which is rather canteen like). So, don't pick this hotel if you want to sit around in the lounge and meet up with friends etc. There is, however, a small cafe/restaurant next door, a supermarket just up the road (for water and snacks) and a kebab shop and internet cafe around the corner. Our room was large and spotlessly clean, with a really nice bathroom, and was very comfortable. Our room rate did not include breakfast though, so we had to pay around 拢8 extra (each). We did this on the first day, but then for the remainder of our stay we went to the supermarket and bought fruit and bread etc instead - much cheaper! Our room was equipped with a kettle - first time ever I've seen one, in a continental hotel! There's also a fridge (containing the mini bar) that you can buy milk and then keep in there. Oh, one more thing - on our arrival, there was a little packet of Harribo on our pillows! A nice touch!

<Content>Clean, friendly hotel. A nice hotel. We stayed in September 2006. Staff were friendly and helpful, and all spoke fluent english. Although a little outside the centre of Berlin (about 20 mins to the centre) the public transport system is excellent. Frequent trains from the Landsberger Allee station (2 minutes walk from the hotel).Whilst the restaurant menu was quite basic the food was of a good quality and the service was good. The hotel rooms are a good size, modern and very clean. The bathroom had a full bath/shower setup and was again very clean (and kept that way during our four day visit). There was a mini-bar in the room although we didn't use it. There is a small shopping centre just around the corner from the hotel (near the S-bahn station) which contains a Lidl supermarket, hairdresser, restaurant and internet cafe (useful if you don't have a laptop!).The only downsides were the view from the hotel (flats and roads) and the noise from the busy road during the day. However, the noise quickly died down at night and the soundproofing within the hotel itself is excellent.

<Content>a little gem My husband and I have just returned from 3 nights at this hotel. Although a tram ride outside berlin city centre for the price this is a great little hotel.The staff are young and incredibly helpful and knowledgable about what to see and do and transport. The rooms are small but clean and warm. The bar is tiny but not at all pricey. The restaurant is underused with a small menu but the food is tasty and well cooked. The tram into berlin city stops just outside the hotel and takes 10-15 mins and they run frequently and on time. I would recommend travellers getting a travel pass at the airport and take the excellent airport express train into the city. All in all a great trip

<Content>Good, nice hotel We have just spent 3 nights in this hotel. We did arrive a few hours before official check in time, so hotel did not have a non smoking standard room available at that time, but we were instead offered an executive room for an extra 5 euros per night, which was still very cheap. The room was very nice, bed was so comfortable that we didn't want to get up. View wasn't fantastic, but we literally only used the room for sleeping, so this did not matter much to us.Only had breakfast once at the hotel for 10euros per person. The usual- cereals, yoghurts, scrambled egg, meatballs, etc. Very nice.Staff were also friendly, but were once given an evil look by a receptionist (who was on the phone) when we came out of the lift chatting...The location was extremely good for transport, the s-bahn and tram stop just around the corner from the hotel (you need the 'Landsberger Allee' s-bahn stop, not 'Storkower St' ; if you're taking tram it's the the same again, and not 'peterberg st/landsberger allee')There wasn't much going on at all by the hotel itself, so we felt like we had to stay out the whole day, since it wasn't worth popping back to the hotel in the middle of the day cos there was nothing to do in that area.Overall a very good hotel, just not close to anything of interest. Be prepared to travel. If we hadn't been in such a hurry, and done more research,we would have chosen something more central because when we got back in the evenings, the area by the hotel was very quiet, quite eerie, no people around.5.80 euros for a day ticket (use this on S  U-bahn and the trams aswell). Good value for money.A 2 hour ticket is 2.10 euros.

<Content>Very good hotel, very good location, very good price Just finished 4 nites at this excellent hotel. I'd say that the hotel is more like a 4 star than 3 star, and that's just the accomodation. Add in the location, and I might score it even higher.I paid a little less than $80/nite for an almost 2 room room (i.e. bedroom and sitting room didn't have a door between them, by they were very nearly separate.) Amenities (including 2 TVs and free daily bottled water) were nice surprises.I found the location to be outstanding, though not for the view from the windows or the community - it's pretty plain. What was excellent, though, was the city access via public transport. With a tramstop (10 mins to Alexanderplatz about every 5 minutes) and S-bahn just outside, nowhere in the city was more than about 15 or 20 minutes away. (On my getaway day, I took the S-bahn 10 minutes (to Beuchstrasse) to directly connect with the airport bus to Tegel to get to the airport in 15 minutes for 3.20 Euros.)Staff  attention was good, with everyone speaking fluent English.If I had to try to find a negative, the bathroom was a bit small, but came with better than average amenities.Overall, I enjoyed my stay, and will now seek out other Park Plaza properties in the future.

<Content>Big room, good breakfast, friendly staff I have just stayed here for seven nights (part business, part pleasure) and was very pleased. I had a huge room (called a business suite); very clean and RadissonSAS-esque furniture and decor. The hotel is located right by Landsberger Allee S-bahn station (on the ring lines) and the tram stop (same name) is served by three high frequency Metrotram routes into the city centre. It takes aboiut 10 minutes into Alexanderplatz.There was a good buffet breakfast at 鈧?0; the minbar prices were on a par with most hotels (eg beer 鈧?.50).The only downside was that every night there was a coach party staying so I needed to choose breakfast times to avoid them as they all went in together.The staff were all friendly and helpful and very willing to speak in English to any non-German speakers.All in all a very pleasing experience and very good value.

<Content>The Park Plaza The hotel it's self is quite modern but we had no idea that it was so far away from the centre and tourist areas of Berlin. Also we were quite surprised to find that there is still such a big divide between East and West Berlin. The Park Plaza Hotel is in East Berlin and the area consists mainly of large derelict buildings, graffiti clad walls and couple of small shops. Our only escape from this was by the wonderful transport system in Berlin, which you should try, as taxis are quite expensive. The staff in the hotel, although pleasant (but rarely smiling) , were unable to speak good English and were unable to give us directions and explain local stuff to us. We found that the bar facilities in the hotel were non-existent and the restaurant menu remained the same for the entire duration of our stay, and to be honest, it didn't inspire us to eat there. The rooms were a good size and clean but the views left an awful lot to be desired and the mini bar was truly over priced as it is in most hotels. It was an experience one which I don't think I'd be too keen to repeat.
