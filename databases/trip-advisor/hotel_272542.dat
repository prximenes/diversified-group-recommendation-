<Content>Excellent small hotel, short walking distance to central Florence This is an excellent small hotel situated about 20 minutes walk from central Florence. We found it necessary to really study the maps to find directions to the hotel, this is because we drove from Pisa in the dark - probably a mistake. Florence's roads are tricky, lots of one-ways, including the hotel's street, plus the traffic volumes are bad. Anyway, we got there after a few detours. Google's Street View of Florence is excellent, it is especially useful to see what you're doing when a U-turn is needed on the Piazza della Liberta!The hotel has car parking in the garden area. Unfortunately, it is a bit tight at times, but the hotel compensates superbly by offering valet parking. The whole deal is just Euros10 per night, which is very reasonable.We had a room in the Garden building, facing the garden, which I suppose was quieter than rooms in the front of the hotel - I didn't hear any ring road noise, but via Lorenzo Il Magnifico is itself a busy road. The staff are first-rate - extremely helpful.The only problem we had was with the heating not coming on. This was quickly fixed.Overall, would recommend the hotel unreservedly for business or tourism.

<Content>Beware of Room 401 Do not stay in room 401. This is a twin bedded room without windows, not even in the bathroom! There is a skylight, but that will not tell you what the weather is like outside. The room is clean and comfortable but without windows it tends to be claustrophobic. The bathroom is beautiful, very modern and well appointed. The beds are comfortable. The breakfast which was included in the package was satisfactory but not exceptional. Warning, the elevator does not go to the floor on which this room is located, you will have to walk up three short flights of steps to get there from the 3rd floor landing. The hotel is walking distance from most of the major attractions in Florence but there is a decided lack of good restaurants in the area. The staff were friendly and mostly spoke reasonable English.

<Content>Excellent Stay - Top Rate Hotel We only stayed here one night mid July through a last minute booking on booking.com. We had a great deal for 鈧?0 per room.The hotel is situated outside the city center. It is a good 20-30 minute walk to the center. We chose this hotel because we were coming by car and the hotel offers private parking.Staff was very friendly and helpful and gave us directions to a wonderful and tasty restaurant 2 blocks away. As we were leaving they were more than helpful to show us the route to Bologna airport, even looking things up on their computer.The room itself was very clean, spacious and provided with airconditioning. The bathroom was also very clean and the rainshower was very welcome after a day exploring this magnificent city.There is a terras outside were you can order drinks. It's very quiet and inviting. Staff informed us a pool was under construction.Breakfast was excellent! A wide range of bread, yoghurt, cereal, juices, cheese, ham, cake,...If I should ever return to Florence (and I hope I will!) I will stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good and not so good We had a 4 night break over the weekend after Easter. Paid 拢360 on web which I guess is pretty fair for this time of year in what can be a very expensive city anyway (Florence is pretty well geared up to extract money from tourists!).Hotel is quite a way out of town - if you include the time to negotiate the nearby ring road in one piece you are probably the best part of half an hour stroll. The route is direct though and you can't get lost.Nothing much of interest around the hotel, a couple of restaurants nearby (will cost about Euro 60-70 for two for 2 courses and house wine and this seems to be the norm in Florence). Good deli just up the road on the Plazza della Liberta with nice people and great cheeses, olives, etc.By the way, beware restaurants in Florence with bottles of wine pre-set on the table - the impression is that this is the normal house wine but it is more likely you'll be charged Euro 25 or so for something that tastes no better. We had a bad experience of this and awful expensive food at Ristorante da Mimmo on the Via San Gallo which runs from near the hotel to the town centre. Not a nice experience.Anyway, back to the hotel. I travel extensively for business and I'd rate this hotel as a good 3 star, not a 4 star. The staff are very friendly and pleasant, our room was pristine in terms of cleanliness (which is the most important thing for me) and the breakfast is quite adequate (you might not be entirely happy if you like english style hot breakfast though I suppose). Room was big enough although no bath or facilities to make a hot drink in the room which was a nuisance.The big downside with our room was the noise. We were at the front of the hotel and it was like a race track out there at certain times of the day. This sadly meant we could not open the windows as the noise would have been intolerable and we could not get the air-con to work but this was't an issue for us as the weather was mild.We were expecting a double bed but in fact we got two twin beds pushed together. Not the end of the world though. Got a pleasant surprise with the room safe - we were not charged anything for using it which is most unusual in my experience. All in all, would be happy to return to this hotel but I think we'd make sure we got a room away from the front.

<Content>Small and very comfortable hotel well positioned in Florence This is a charming and comfortable hotel in Florence, with excellent deals for bookings in advance. The staff was top shelf, and often could not do enough to make me feel welcome, especially in the breakfast room. The location, just a few blocks out from the center of the city, is ideal, and surprisingly quiet, yet everything of interest is easily within walking distance.

<Content>Solid 4 star hotel about 15-20 minutes walk to major attractions I stayed at this hotel one night. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk from major Florence attractions and is located in a safe neighborhood. We paid about 70 Euros for our small 2 bed room. The bathroom was gorgeous but the stunning shower fixtures were clogged and corroded with limescale, so the shower was terrible but pretty to look at. Our room had a high glass ceiling with electric black-out blinds to block out the daylight. In-room WiFi is free if you ask the front desk for a temporary password. The staff is helpful and spoke English fairly well.

<Content>Gold Discovered Again After a bad experience in London with a supposed FOUR STAR experience, we hit pay dirt in Florence. The Lorenzo Il Magnifico is all FOUR STAR at a reasonable price. Rooms excellent, bath is modern, jacuzzi tub and separate shower, mini bar, outdoor patio, private parking, outstanding breakfast and excellent staff. But the most important is their location. Just off the busy feeder streets, the hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio and the river. What a find. Thanks Lorenzo! We'll be back.

<Content>Not the best location On arrival to this Hotel we were welcomed by a clerly inexperienced young female receptionist who just about managed to hand over a key for the room.We were given a twin room on the 3 rd floor which was clearly unsuitable for 2 people .Small and seriously cramped!Unhappy with that I went back to the reception and asked to the female receptionist to be shown something else.Usual answer We are fully booked ...My reply was  Don't be ridiculous there is hardly anyone here...but if you want me to i'll check your website to see if you really are ...So she called someone else, a rather unpleasant and clearly unhappy caracther who reluctantly showed me about 5 empty rooms, some on the outside building across the court yard...I needed a twin and not a double and apparently there wasn't anyone available to make the beds for us....so in the end ,fed up and rather tired to go up and down ,i decided for a room and made the beds myself.....Great service for a 4 star hotel! Didn't she say they were fully booked ????The rooms are in general spacious enough ( i have seen quite few ) and fixtures and fittings adequate but the ones by the main road should be avoided as this hotel is located by a very busy and noisy road .The common areas don't offend the eyes and the breakfast served in the morning is plentyful and good enough for anyone.It is served by pleasant and helpful staff.On the plus side there is a car park at no extra charge ,nedeed as you can not park anywhere around the area or Florence for that matterThe location is hardly ideal as this place is not remotely near to anything of relevant importance..The heart of Florence is an expensive cab ride away ...public transport is an other option or a strong pair legs will be very useful.If you are on a budget this place will certainly suit your needs as for a claimed 4 stars and clearly is not , the facilities are more than adequate but the distance from the centre can put quite few people off.

<Content>Would recommend this hotel I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting florence and who is prepared to walk into the city and back again. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast staff were very keen to help. The hotel was in good condition, clean and our room was fine. There is a great little restaurant about a 10 minute walk towards the centre called Messere try it, and for those on a real budget on the opposite corner there you will find a really cheap place to eat offering reasonable quality food. PS. Try not to go in August if you can help it the Italians and the rest of the world holiday here then and if you go to the Ufizzi gallery reserve a ticket, we qued for 3.5 hours to get in. Enjoy....

<Content>Great Service My friend and I stayed at the Lorenzo il Magnifico at the end of May 2007. The hotel itself is just outside the main business district, but a very easy walk to all attractions and the train station. Our room air conditioner stopped working and we were immediately given a better room at no additional cost. The breakfast buffet was American-style with eggs, fresh fruit , assortment of breads and coffee. General Manager Marco and his staff were very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely go back again.

<Content>A real; gem What a find. On short notice, we found a room here -- 4 stars at a reasonable rate since iit is not directly in the central area. But not so far. (It is not like Florence is NYC -- it is a small city/town). We walked it in the morining, cabbed home. 20 minute, flat walk (Was worried about how far this was really going to be, but it is in the city, just not in the historic area. ), 8-10 Euro cab. Great clean room, large, sploless bathroom (in the newer garden house annex), very comfortable bed. Included breakfast buffet in the moring, wine in a drawing room late afternon. Exttremely accomodating staff, great with restaraunt recommendations, reservations,, calling cabs, etc. Free wireless. Free parking in their little lot. (I think it was free) If you like a nice hotel and are willing to be just a little out of the main, don't hestitate about this one.

<Content>Hot and small! I was very disappointed in this hotel. The room was very small and very got! We traveled to Florence in the Spring, the air conditioning had not yet been turned on and they still had the heat on. We asked them to turn the heat off. They did not even have a fan system to circulate the air, it was very hot and stuffy even with the window open. The bathroom was also very small, we had to sit sideways on the toilet because it was so close to the wall! It was not worth the money!

<Content>Lovely hotel, wonderful staff Although the hotel is in a quiet location about a 15-minute walk into the centre, it is excellent value for money. It also has its own secure parking, which was difficult to find in Florence.The staff are very friendly and helpful, even providing us with complimentary maps and guidebooks to Florence. Our room was an excellent size, with a lovely bathroom and plenty of space although a little dark as we only had one window. Breakfast was lovely.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely go back.

<Content>really good value for money Excellent hotel - despite of the fact that it faces a busy street.I spent only one night at Lorenzo Il Magnifico in July 2004. We had already booked a hotel in Florence for 5 days (Diana Park Hotel - also an excellent accomodation), but arrived a day earlier, Diana Park was fully booked, so we had to find an other hotel room. That was in Lorenzo Il Magnifico. I think that the price was exceptional regarding Florence hotel prices: 90 EUR/night. Staff was very polite and nice.The room and bathroom are nicely decorated and spotlessly clean (bathroom is huge with double basins and a jacuzzi tube).Rooms facing the main street may be noisy, but we managed to get a room at the back of the hotel facing the garden/courtyard, so it was quiet.Breakfast is also fine with great choice of food.We had a chance to park our car within the courtyard of the hotel as well.City center is in easy reach from the hotel (by foot 20 minutes, but there are frequent bus lines also).All in all, in my opinion this is a good city hotel near to the historical centere of Florence.

<Content>Very Nice We ended up booking this hotel for one night while we were in Florence and were very happy. The room was nice with a large whirlpool tub. The staff was very friendly and recommended a wonderul restraunt within walking distance. The only thing is location, it's a bit of a walk...but you can always grab a cab....with the price you save on such a nice hotel it's worth it. Overall, we were extremely happy with the hotel and would stay again.

<Content>Mosquitos This hotel would get a much better rating if there were screens on the windows. Since it was spring, air was not on yet, so had to open the windows--the mosquitos were horrendous. Choice was stifling in heat or being eaten alive. The rooms were elegant but very small. The staff was friendly and helpful, breakfast good. Walking distance to the Duomo.

<Content>Highly recommended We stayed in the Lorenzo Il Magnifico for 3 nights in August 2004. The standard of the accommodation was excellent and the staff were extremely helpful - to the extent that they sent out for a takeaway pizza on our behalf when my wife was feeling unwell. Considering that accommodation in Florence can be expensive we felt that the hotel represented very good value for money. The location is in a quiet part of town but is within easy reach of the city centre by public transport. Would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Value and Wonderful Service! Found a good deal on this hotel at one of the discount web-sites, and it was by far the best value out of my month-long tour of Europe. The room was big, and the bathroom had two sinks and a walk in shower. Breakfast was included in the price, which included breads, cereals, juices, coffee, and buffet. The hotel is a bit of a walk to the Arno River, but taxis, buses and my own two feet always got me around very easily. I would stay here again in the future, and highly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>I love this hotel! Lorenzo il Magnifico is a wonderful hotel. I've stayed in this hotel twice and I love it.True- it is located on a busy street and the views are not impressive... but everything else inside the hotel is very nice. The sheets and towels are amazing and both my rooms had sunken Jacuzzi tubs. Everything is sanitized, which is really important to me. As a matter of fact, it probably the cleanest hotel I've stayed in.The Duomo is about a 15 min walk, but in Italy, walking is what it's all about!In my opinion, Lorenzo il Magnifico offers excellent service and impeccable cleanliness!

<Content>Don't do it!!!! The first lesson to be learnt from staying here is DON'T TRUST THE PHOTOS on internet sites! The majority of pictures of the hotel show the rear of the hotel - it actually fronts onto a very busy main road - so if you are looking for peace  quiet demand a room at the rear of the building.If you do get a room at the rear of the building then watch out for the fact that you might end up with a room without hardly any window - we were given a room with a window about 1 ft high by 4ft across!!! This was all masked of course with huge drapes! The walls were paper thin - we spent the next morning listening to our neighbours washing, using the toilet, packing etc...!We then learnt that aside from the evening manager (who was fantastic) the rest of the management had an appalling attitude. When we complained about the room we were told tough, we then asked why there was no mention of this room on the hotel website (which provoked a bout of failing to understand English). It was only when we demanded our money back and a move to a new hotel that they eventually relented and moved us into a new room.The hotel is NOT 10 mins walk from the centre either - it is at least 20 mins walk from the Duomo - we ended up getting taxis which are cheap and plentiful.Breakfast is great, but I don't usually choose hotels on this merit alone - my advice to you is to leave this hotel WELL alone - there are plenty of better hotels in the city!
