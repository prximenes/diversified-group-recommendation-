<Content>Relaxing, quiet location. Great service. We and our friends each took a super-delux room for 8 nights and were very happy with the generous size room, with a sitting area and spacious balcony. Staff were also great and always helpful, with Bali smiles all round.The restaurant on-site was good and reasonably priced and there are also some (not all) good restaurants only a short walk away if you want extra variety. Location is the big issue with Tegal Sari. We hadn't done much research so didn't realise quite how large Bali was! Ubud is central-ish and it's at least a 1 hour drive to any beach. Many travellers, though, would find Ubud a very pleasant change from the touristy beaches of the south - you could be anywhere in the world sitting in Sanur- , but you should be prepared for this. Ubud can be a busy town, so you don't feel remote as such. In our view Ubud offered a much better view of Bali life - we were lucky we aren't that fussed about sitting on beaches. [a tour of the island staying at 3-4 different parts of the island would be my choice next time.] Bali is a large island and the road system is quite basic, so it can sometimes takes ages to get anywhere. Instead of using shuttles and taxis, we used the hotel's car + driver service (3 times) and would thoroughly recommend it, as it works out a much more comfortable option than using a taxi, plus you get a fairly useful guide and a less life-threatening ride than mbike rental! For 2 or more people it is more economical than taking one-way shuttles and it's miles more flexible of course.

<Content>We Have Made Reservations for 2009! Our family's (my wife and I and two teenaged children, aged 13 and 15) stay in Tegal Sari in 2007 was so enjoyable that we booked a full year ahead for a 10 day stay from 6 - 16 Dec 2008. And yes, we had a great time again! Our Super Delux rooms (19  20) were simple but very clean, quiet and comfortable, with great views of the padi fields. An unlikely bonus - no TVs, so we had many family chats in the balcony over drinks and snacks as we watched the evening sky soften into shades of pink and orange and the padi fields sway in the breeze. Breakfast in the rooms was a treat, laundry was cheap (so we brought only 2 set of clothes), transport easily arranged and very reasonably priced (RP60000 per hour, but free to Ubud centre) and massages consistently good. The best part of Tegal Sari must be the people. Always smiling and helpful, they certainly take pride in their work and everyone we encountered in our 10 day stay was friendly and went out of their way to make our stay a positive experience. For instance, on inquiring about how to better protect a large framed painting I purchased, it came back to me well fortified with cardboard, with a raffia handle included. Another example was when Pande, who drove us to the airport, waited in the reception area until all our luggage was checked in. This was in response to our concern that some of the stuff we bought was a little too large and heavy and may not be accepted as luggage. Pande's reply to us was, If there is any problem, I'll be in the reception and will take the stuff back to the hotel and you can decide how you wish to ship them over later. And yes, he was there when I went to inform him that all the luggage had cleared the check-in.We have made reservations for 2009 already.

<Content>super time, gorgeous place put simply, I loved this place. It was a nice little hideaway on a great shopping street. It was so pretty and quiet, the staff always smiling and happy to help. I must have called them for rides 10 times while I was there and it was never a problem. I also loved their pumpkin soup and lime juice. I hope to go back again, this time for my honeymoon.

<Content>Family's favourite hotel This is the second time our family stayed in Tegal Sari. The first was in Dec 2006 and the most recent one, from Dec 5 - 8, 2008. We brought another family along with us this time and they loved it too.This is one of our favourite hotels in Bali. Beautiful settings, friendly and accommodating staff and the rice-field views. What else can you ask for? The hotel also offers cheap laundry, complimentary transfers to ubud central. We also arranged for spa treatments during our stay there. Thoroughly enjoyed it. A session of 2.5 hours including massage, scrub, mask and floral bath cost 175000RP. Heavenly. With kids around, we also got the hotel staff to arrange for kite-making session and the village walk. They loved it and they proclaimed that TS is the NO 1 hotel in this trip (We stayed in 3 hotels when we were in Bali in early Dec) . We will be back for sure..

<Content>Best Value and great experience Wow, such good value at $70 a night, really large room overlooking the rice paddies. This little resort is amazing, so service orientated, great sister property (beauty salon, though go for the massage not the facial) Also really cheap laundery service. Cute little breakfasts, did not eat lunch or dinner their as went to various other places in Ubud. But as a family we really enjoyed our time at Tegal Sari. This place has got so much going for it, no wonder I had to book 6 months in advance. Would def recommend it.

<Content>Exceeded All Expectations I found this hotel through TripAdvisor.com, and needless to say, my expectations were rather high after reading the reviews on this site.However, my expectations were exceeded. It was simply the best hotel I stayed in Asia so far. The rooms were great, with excellent views of tranquil rice paddies which you can even wade in. Not some kitsch display, but real rice paddies which farmers still work in every morning.The best thing about this hotel was its impeccable service. You get free room service for the free breakfast they provide (or any other meal you wish to have, in fact) - imagine dining with the view of the rice paddies and rural Ubud in front of you! And the staff are always so polite, smiley and courteous. I recommend booking the hotel car for Rp60,000 (less than US$6!) per hour for a guided tour of whichever place you want to visit in the area. The staff are knowledgeable and chatty, beats any other paid tour guide service! Best of all, you get to choose your own itinerary.You just have to stay here - its so value for money as well, we added a bed in a super deluxe room so we could fit our family of 4 and it was just RP675,000 - approx US$60! A pity we only stayed for one night, next time if I visit Bali I'll definitely come back to the Tegal Sari for a much longer stay!Highly recommended.

<Content>loved it! My husband and I are frequent travelers, so to say that we think highly of a property would have to mean that it is exceptional. And, of course, the Tegal Sari was exceptional, in every possible way. Our rooms were elegant, comfortable, and clean. The staff was courteous and extraordinarily friendly - absolutely willing to assist us in any way possible. I would recommend having your breakfast delivered directly to your room in the morning - it just makes your vacation there that much more relaxing and luxurious! We stayed in the wooden room upstairs, which was lovely. We had our breakfast delivered to us and ate it on the balcony while overlooking the rice paddies. I got some wonderful photos out of it, and of course, I will forever have that beautiful image in my mind. We highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return.

<Content>The best hotel stay we ever had! We were there for our honeymoon and spent one of the best times there. The view was scenic, fantastic and mind blowing. The hotel set up was unique and beautiful. The services were excellent as all the staff were extremely warm, friendly, helpful and accommodating. We were provided free shuttle service to the Ubud centre to and fro at any time we wanted. The staff made every effort to provide for our needs asap as in the case where our room toilet flush was spoilt. We reported the matter in the morning to the staff and then we took our breakfast. By the time we went back to our room it was already fixed! The whole experience here made our honeymoon such a wonderful and memorable time for us!

<Content>Mixed feelings We stayed for 6 nights at this property and we were really looking forward to it because of all the great reviews. Whilst the staff are great, the views of the rice paddies lovely and the location is very good there are a few things that I didn't like. The kitchen area that can be viewed from the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired, it really is off putting. If you order breakfast to have on your verandah which would have been very pleasant expect it to arrive completely cold if you are in a room that is some distance from the restaurant. This could be overcome if they simply covered the food! Also I felt that (and did mention to the staff) this was not a hygienic way of delivering food. The room we had was nice enough (the super dlx wooden) with an extremely comfortable bed but with grass mats on the floor that made the room smell like a wet dog! The water in the bathroom has a very bad odour to it which didn't make for a pleasant shower. I did not find this a problem at our other hotel in Ubud nor at other locations around Bali.

<Content>Amazing value for money 3 nights in the Tegal Sari was not enough. The Wooded room was fantastic and a wonderful place to relax, sitting on our private verandah at sunset watching the farmers chasing the birds away from their crops was brilliant. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Will definately be back only next time will be for longer.

<Content>Absolutely Amazing! Beautiful with wonderful hospitality My husband and I stayed at the Tegal Sari for 3 days during our honeymoon. We had read the wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor - we went in with high hopes and our expectations were surpassed. This place is absolutely fabulous and an AMAZING AMAZING value! We stayed at 4 hotels while in Bali, and this place was the least expensive but also the most special and beautiful. We had the Duplex room. It was two stories with both a porch and balcony, and an outdoor bathroom (very private) that also included a private hot tub. It was extremely romantic. The view from the porch and balcony cannot be beat. We enjoyed breakfast every day brought to our room sitting on our balcony overlooking the spectacular view of the rice fields. It was some of the most gorgeous scenery we have seen in or lives. The room was very clean and well kept up. The 'room' was really like its own house, because it was two stories and not attached to any other rooms. It felt very private but at the same time not removed from the rest of the grounds. The stone pool is also beautiful and has fabulous views. The staff there are very welcoming and helpful. Also, the location cannot be beat. It is literally about a 3 minute walk from downtown Ubud, where there is much to see. The staff there could not have been more helpful and welcoming. They gave us great advice for local activities, got tickets to a dance performance for us, and drove us to our next destination. During our honeymoon in Bali we stayed at 3 beach resorts, and the Tegal Sari felt like an exotic treat - quant, charming, private, great location, and very romantic. While in Bali you must leave the beaches for a few days to experience the Tegal Sari!!!

<Content>great hotel!!! book in away advance! Just loved this hotel. Everything was excellent. The room was just right size (very cozy, not too small) with a cute patio. Staff are just excellent. When we arrived, a staff at the front desk led us to our room and explained everyhing about the room. All of them were just so pleasant, even kitchen staff, who said hi to us when we bumped into each other on the street. They were just very confident and professional. They drive you and pick you up anywhere in Ubud. I just felt so bitter that we only could have stayed one night at their hotel because they were fully booked for the other 3 days. We were also glad that we arranged a tour with them even though after moved to the other hotel. Breakfast was yummy, although it is not as plenty as breakfast buffet. Their banana pancake was a winner. it is a litlle sad that we could have not helped comparing Tegal Sari with a second hotel we had to move to... Tegal Sari was just too perfect. We would love to come back there again and try to book for a wooden room. It is worth waiting for 6 months.

<Content>Exceptional Value Great Staff Amazing Views We have stayed at Tegal Sari three times, and got married on their grounds in 2005. It is a small hotel surrounded by rice fields and an easy walk up Monkey Forest Road up into Ubud central. The hotel has older rooms and some brand new rooms at the end of the rice field. The pool is lovely with lots of room for lounging. If you want the very best view from your room, ask to reserve room #24. Trust us, you won't be dissapointed. Most rooms have a view of the verdant green rice fields, but #24 has views on two sides and is on the end, with the view over to the monkey forest. The hotel staff are incredibly friendly and will do everything they can to make you feel at home. They will bring all your food to your room if you would like (and the restaurant is better each time we go there with a fabulous variety of foods for breakfast). They will go and pick up Baba Gouling for you and bring it back to the hotel for you to eat on your balcony. They know where the good mask carvers are and where to go for interesting temples and bike rides. We won't stay anywhere else in Ubud.

<Content>Great place to stay, excelent staff Spent 2 nights at Tegal Sari this week and it was great. The setting was lovely. The thing that was the standout for this little hotel was the quality of the service from the staff. Nothing was too much trouble. We have stayed at a few upmarket resorts costing almost ten times the price of Tegal Sari and the staff at those places havent been as good as Tegal Sari's ! Room had great view. Breakfasts good. Excellent value and a handy location too.

<Content>Amazing view Tegal Sari is a beautiful located hotel with a good service. The attraction was the view from our terrace! The service was fine but not exceptional. The breakfast is simple but tasty. The prices of the minibar and drinks around the nice swimmingpool were very low. We didn't have diner at Tegal Sari because the restaurant area is in the middle of the complex without the nice view and it isn't very cosy. The Laundry service was OK and very cheap: t-shirt IRP 2.000, trousers 3.500We had diner twice at Warung Enak which was excellent and situated around the corner. We had a rijsttafel which include a starter, soup, main course and dessert for IDR 250.000 p.p.Once we ate at Bebek Bengil which was just OK but more touristic and more expensive. The famous Bebek Bengil is IDR 63.000 and you will really need at least a appetizer or dessert. A small beer is IDR 15.000, a mineral water 6.000.The last night we ate at Pundi-pundi which was also good. They had a lovely Soto Ayam IRP 28.000. We had lunch at Lotus and Cafe Wayan, both to recommend. Through Tegal Sari we booked Kecak Fire and Trance Dance which was nice to see and hear (no music only human voices making music). We had a free transfer from the hotel.We had a excellent massage at Bali Botanica. I had a Mandi Lulur and my husband and son had the Mandi Kopi coffee bath). Each IRP 175.000. Enjoying your floral bath before the open window you have a splendid view on the forest. Very special.We also had a good massage at Pertenin

<Content>Our best holiday ever!!! Our stay at the Tegal Sari in June was an absolute joy. It was my 5th trip to Bali but the first time myself or my boyfriend have stayed in Ubud. We initially stayed a night in the deluxe room (number 17) and moved to the wooden room the next night where we stayed for four nights. The Wooden room was fantastic and the view was simply stunning. The staff of the Tegal Sari were always friendly and helpful and definitely made our stay more enjoyable and it was never a problem to arrange transport or activities. We had some fantastic meals in Ubud our favourites were Cinta, Indus, Casa Luna, Cafe Wayan and Cafe de artistes (best nasi goreng I have ever eaten!)It was a real shock returning to Kuta after our stay in Ubud, so noisy and busy. Next time we plan to spend our entire stay in Ubud at the Tegal Sari. I would definitely recommend the hotel especially the wooden room to anyone but book early!!

<Content>Get Your Reservation in Writing Our visit to Tegal Sari was a disappointment. This hotel's business practices appear to be suffering from it's success.Already in Bali and planning to travel to Ubud, we called the hotel for a room for 2 nights for 3 persons. We were told on the phone by the manager that we could have a triple room for one night for $100, and they watch for a cancellation on the second night. We confirmed our reservation by giving a credit card number.When we arrived, we were told by the check-in staff there was a mistake and the room would now cost $150. The manager was not at the hotel. They admitted, however, that we had confirmed the room for $100. The clerks insisted that if we looked at the room, we would be willing to pay $150. We insisted that we should get the room for the price confirmed.After a call to the manager, they came back to say we could have the room for the $100 price confirmed earlier, but we would not get breakfast included, and we would be expected to leave the next day by noon. They then informed us that charging the room would cost an extra 1.8%, and if we wanted bedsheets for the third person, that would cost an extra $5.The check-in staff were clearly embarrassed when having to communicate these messages from the manager. I should point out that Tegal Sari apparently has two websites, one (http://tegal-sari.com/) which does not publish room rates, and one (http://www.tegalsari-ubud.com) that says their most expensive room is Rp. 600,000 (about $65), including breakfast. The staff claimed the $150 price is on their website, but it is not.Honoring a confirmed price is a basic obligation of a good hotel. Any hotel that tries to pull a bait and switch like this is not worthy of being rated #1 of the 60-some hotels rated in the Ubud area. I felt as if we had ordered a meal at a restaurant and when the bill came, we were told the prices on the menu had gone up since the time we ordered.Our room was very nice, and maybe you won't have the same problem we did. But there are at least 7 or 8 similar hotels in Ubud, some with even better views and locations, that will not try to push you into a higher price room. Why take the risk?

<Content>My experience I stayed at the Tegal Sari July 1-8 and found the property largely lives up to its reputation. I had a midlevel room which was quite reasonable, and enjoyed having a rice field right outside my verada and having breakfast every morning on the veranda. Food was really good, especially breakfast. I did eat at the restaraunt and it has reasonable prices and good variety. Staff were always helpful and cheerful. The location was superior, close enough to town to walk most places yet removed from the noise and hustle of the city. The only really negative experience was that myself and another couple made arrangements to go to one of the local dances and our pickup was late, saying they could not find us, when we were exactly where we were told to be. They were apologetic, so I did blow this out of proportion, but did honestly express my feelings.I absolutely would stay there again.

<Content>very good staff i have stayed in super delux room. the room was located in front of the ricefied and had amazing view. we could also see the ricefield from our bathroom. room was fairly big and tidy. however the sofa and cushions were little bit old....if they can change some of amenities, this hotel will be much better.all the staff was really helpful, polite and friendly. there was free transport to ubud anything you like. the location was good. you can get everything near the hotel and not too far from the ubud central.

<Content>Tegal Sari Ubud - Great place to stay We (4 of us - 2 adults and 2 kids) stayed in deluxe bungalow #15 from June 22 - 25. This was our first visit to Bali, we booked Tegal Sari because of the excellent internet reviews, and I have to say the reviews are all true.Room/Bungalow #15 is the first property off of the check in desk, and it has its own private courtyard with a wooden door to enter the courtyard. We loved the privacy. It does not have a view of the rice fields, but I think the private courtyard more than make up for it.The room itself originally has 1 queen bed and 1 twin bed, so we added an extra bed. There is also a small sectional in the room to sit and a small fridge. The bathroom has a window to the courtyard and quite large. There is a bathtub and a shower area in the bathroom. There is a pool at the back of the property, a little small, but ok.I agree with previous reviews that the best part of Tegal Sari is the staff. They are very friendly and always go out of their way to help us. I would recommend the spa also - it is called Pertinen and it is owned by the same person who owns Tegal Sari. A 90 min balinese massage is an equivalent of USD $15. You can get a mani and pedicure for another USD $15. We also went to the Monkey Forest - 5 minutes walk through the back of the property. There is also free shuttle to go anywhere in Ubud and we never had to wait long for the shuttle.Ubud Market and Babi guling (suckling pig) Ibu (Mrs) Oka in front of the market is a must visit. Be sure if you want the suckling pig lunch to come early (like 11 am) as there is always a long line around lunch time.Next time I am in Bali, I would book 6 months in advance to get a wooden room!

<Content>Fantastic Service and Great Value! Stayed in wooden room #20. Excellent value and very clean. The property is beautiful but the one caveat we have is the traffic noise which we didn't see mentioned by other reviewers, so it was a surprise. The best thing about the Tegal Sari is the staff. They are very friendly and efficient and can't do enough for you. We never had to wait long for their free shuttle service. We took the trek and cooking class that they offer and would recommend both. We could only book 4 nights as they were full so we switched to Greenfield Bungalows next door for the next 2 nights. It's a lot quieter but more expensive and the service not so good.Restaurants we recommend are 3 Monkeys, Cafe Wayan, Murni's and although expensive, we highly recommend an evening at Mosaic. Nomad we found too noisy.

<Content>Everything good you read is true!! It is true! Tegal Sari is truly wonderful and an amazing value. The staff are so friendly and helpful. We stayed for a week and wish we had booked longer. The location is beautiful with the views of the rice paddies. We spent the first five days in a superior room which was both comfortable and spotless and we were fortunate to spend our last few nights a the wooden room which was like something out of a dream vacation magazine at a fraction of the cost. The next time and there will be a next time we will book earlier and spend the whole time in Ubud and the wooden room at Tegal Sari. It was our 3rd visit to beautiful Bali and without a doubt our best.

<Content>Nice stay - but overrated by this site! Yes, we had a good stay and yes it is a nice hotel with good views on the rice paddies. Good value - however the standard rooms didn't really have a good bathroom (not to clean). If you have the choice book a more expensive room!

<Content>Great stay Thoroughly pleasant stay. Staff was unfailingly polite and friendly (though true of about everyone we met in Bali), room was comfortable. Internet connection was lousy, though. Only available in the restaurant, and was very slow. We organized pickup by the hotel from the airport. No brainer, as it's the same cost as a taxi.

<Content>Unforgetable Experience Me and my husband stayed in Deluxe with paddy field view.Spectacular...Spacious bathroom.Enjoyed my jacuzi.While my children and the group stayed in Super Deluxe with pantry and spacious balcony facing the paddy field.Eventhough we only spent one night here, but it was unforgetable.January 2008 , we went to Ubud again but unfortunetly the hotel was fully booked. Then this coming July 2008, i am coming again but only have a chance to stay in Superior Room.But thru the review, i believe i will have the great experience.The views, the staffs and the welcoming ice lemon tea are marvelous..Dont forget to have the fried banana with honey and ice cream.Cannot stand to wait until July...

<Content>Superb Experience ! We decided to stay at Tegal Sari after reading the reviews from Trip Advisor. Stayed at Room 26 which is new, clean with a balcony that offers spectacular views of padi fields with ducks swimming in there ! They serve you refreshing Welcome Drink (authentic  home-made) that you can't get in 5-stars hotel in addition with the genuine smile and greetings ! Tropical gardens set around the cosy small restaurant. Lush greenery  flowers surround the massage pavallion as well as the swimming pool.Service level at Tegal Sari is simply 6-stars ! On the day of check-out, a shop owner supposed to deliver an item that we bought nearby  hasn't arrived. An employee of Tegal Sari called them up  within minutes our purchase are here. This is truly the high level of customer service that they provide ! All staff are eager to provide the best service that they could provide to all guest together with their genuine warm  friendly smile and attitude.Convenient Stores and restaurants are just a 5-minutes walk. Monkey Forest Road is only approx. 10-minutes away.The massage is excellent when we compared the one that we had at Jimbaran area.We will be back soon ! Thanks a lot Tegal Sari for making our stay a memorable one !!!

<Content>Flawless!!! Stayed at Tegal Sari for 3 nights and it was a truely memorable experience. Everything from the rooms, the drivers, the food and spa were flawless. The service was exceptionally good and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The Pertenin Spa by Tegal Sari was also good. The price is also slightly cheaper than the other Spa houses available around Ubud. Maybe because we are guests in Tegal Sari. Although the Spa is located in a secluded corner of Ubud, free transport to and fro from the hotel to the spa is provided. The staff will pick us up from the hotel lobby and send us to the spa and after we are done, the spa staff will contact Tegal sari to pick us up in less than 10 minutes. You could also request to charge your spa treatment to be charge together with the hotel bill. Hassle free and impressive!On the last day of our stay, we did have much time to make it to the Ubud market to tried out the babi guling by Ibu Oka since we've had a spa arranged. So we requested that staff to pack for us as lunch. Just before we checked out, we had Babi Guling served at the Tegal Sari Abian restaurant. It was truely a memorable experience and definitely value for money.

<Content>My Second Home--Tegal Sari Ubud Tegal Sari is our favorite place in Ubud. We have been there about 15 times in 5 yrs. We have stayed in most rooms and have had all our family and friends stay there. It is in the rice fields and has a wonderful view, pool and service. The staff at Tegal Sari are sincere, helpful and friendly. It is a unique Balinese experience--it is truly one of a kind!! I use the airport pick up and the free transport around town. The rooms are spotless, reasonable, and have all the necessary things a 4-5 star hotel would offer. Their spa is highly recommended for quality and price. You feel the warmth of the place--of course I am known by my first name, and even calling from my city in E Java the staff know my voice on the phone. Wonderful value and a heavenly place to stay. I have told too many people about this place--it is hard to get a room--the word is out!! Mr Mike

<Content>Totally impressed I have read all the reviews here before making the booking with Tegal Sari. I am totally impressed with the quality of service provided, the ambience and the rooms! The rooms are right in the middle of the padi fields. My 4 year old son was so taken in by the sight of farmers tending to the fields that he just stood at the verandah and watched them every afternoon. For the first 3 nights, we stayed in the super deluxe wooden room which is on the first floor. We could hear the birds chirping on the attap roof and crickets at night! We felt so close to nature! The whole place is just pure serenity. The staff were all very attentive and pleasant. Their service was impeccable. They will oblige in every possible way. On our last day, we wanted to eat the infamous suckling pig from Ibu Oka. Due to time constraint, we asked the staff if they could help us packed the food back from Ibu Oka. They obliged and brought the food to our rooms. And it is within walking distance from Bebek Bengil (Dirty Duck), Monkey Forest Road and the shops at Jalan Hanoman. I will definitely stay in Tegal Sari again! Oh... last but not least, the room rates are unbeatable value!!!

<Content>Perfect Experience It's home away from home! The perfect mix of authentic/exotic surroundings and comfy service. My husband and I stayed in both the Duplex and the Super Deluxe Wooden Room. The Duplex is fun because you have your own little private villa, but the S.D. Wooden Room was more then adequate. The staff is what really makes this place but the fact that there are decent sheets and a very reasonable priced mini-bar are a huge plus too!Tip: Do pack a flashlight; the sidewalks in Ubud are full of serious holes.The hotel will transport you into town (free) with just 15 min. warning but for longer trips, a great driver in the area is Putu Dedy Sanjaya (just call him Putu). You can call him at [--] or email at [--]. We used several drivers during our stay but he was by far the best! Just a great guy all around!

<Content>A Truly Memorable Experience We stayed in Tegal Sari for 3 nights during our honeymoon and it was a thoroughly, flawless experience. The service was extra-ordinary, everyone was very friendly, helpful and delivered speedy responses. Our favorite was Nyoman who was always smiling everytime we saw him. Breakfast was wonderful, we especially loved the Tegal Sari Balinese Banana Pancake. The Super Deluxe room was spacious, clean and the view was simply breathtaking. Laundry was very cheap and service was good. Truly a remarkable experience and will definitely come back for more !

<Content>Perfect! We loved Tegal Sari! It is such a cute property, tucked away in the rice paddies. It's also a very easy walk to restaurants, internet, bars, the monkey reserve, shops  town. (if you don't want to walk to town, there is free transport from the hotel)The manager was lovely, and he made sure we were looked after. He seemed really nice to all the guests, and spoke fluent Japanese as well as english, and indonesian. Amazing!Our room came with free breakfast, which was nice  always tasty. Our room was the cheapest rooms, so not much of a view. Oh, and 2 twin beds (we're a couple) but for a few nights we could handle it. When we were checking out the manager asked if we wanted to see one of their deluxe rooms (he seemed very proud to show us). They were, of course, beautiful. Next time we'll splurge!!

<Content>Recommended We have used the Tegal Sari for four years, and have visited Bali five times in this period. We were originally recommended to this hotel by friends who are frequent Bali visitors.We are always welcomed like old friends when we arrive and are treated very well. The facilities are excellent and the service is great.The best thing about the Tegal Sari is the staff. Nothing is too much trouble.The spa is also excellent with a wide variety of treatments for men and women.Do visit this hotel, an ideal place to spend your whole holiday or just a few days en route, perhaps to the North of Bali

<Content>Deserves the number one rating !! Very beautiful, intimate ,friendly little hotel. Book well in advance to avoid being disappointed. So relaxing sitting on our verandah overlooking the rice fields - bliss :)Try to get a new room if possible. Could go on and on - but it has all been said before - so just do yourself favour and go....Heaven on earth as they say.

<Content>Simply the best Rightly sits at no.1 spot - and we booked on the back of rave reviews TA's gave this place.It's excellent value for money, booking is a must as it is incredibly popular. We stayed in two different rooms - as our first choice wasn't available throughout our stay. The first the wooden room was our fav. Just classically styled, peaceful and simply furnished although it does suffer more bugs than the brick-built rooms. The second room was a super deluxe. All rooms are built around the rice field so all have wonderful views and some superb sunsets can be had. This does means some of the further rooms are a long walk from reception.As others have mentioned the service is superb, personal, gracious and always smiling and eager to please. If I could make one small criticism - the breakfast/room service food was usually tepid/warm rather than hot (maybe because of the long walk from the kitchen?).

<Content>True Heaven on Earth I recommend Tegal Sari with all my heart!! To those who want total relaxation, value-for-money, tranquility, serenity this is a place to be. I loved everything abt Tegal Sari - the rooms ( we stayed in Superior Room then moved to Wooden Room - both are really good), the food (we had breakfast brought to our room at no charge), the most friendliest staffs ever, a good good good service! Evertything abt Tegal Sari is perfect! So sad to leave Tegal Sari but i do have Tegal Sari everywhere around me now - pictures of it on the wall, screensaver n wallpapers on my PC, etc. In fact i am still drooling abt it even now!!Will definitely go there again!!!

<Content>Excellent small hotel in Ubud We stayed at the Tegal for five nights. What a gem of a hotel. Located about a 20 minute walk from downtown Ubud and from the Monkey Forest by sidewalk, this hotel is tops for service. The staff called us by our names. They bring breakfast to your patio if you prefer eating there, rather than in their outdoor dining area. So we were able to gaze upon the beautiful rice fields and ponds while having breakfast. It would be nice though if breakfast was more flexible. The hotel offers a set menu. We ordered extra toast one morning, as only one slice accompanies eggs. When checking out we were told that the toast was an extra. When we said that we were not told of this charge, they kindly took it off. But we thought the charge was petty. Otherwise this hotel is highly recommended. We thoroughly enjoyed our time, relaxing by the pool or on our patio, walking in Ubud and taking in Bali. The hotel鈥檚 shuttle service is a very nice free service. We ate in the city twice. Since the sidewalks in Bali are dangerous (being full of holes), we decided returning to the hotel on foot at night was not advisable. We simply gave the hotel card to the restaurant, a staff member phoned the hotel, and the hotel picked us up in about 15 minutes 鈥?no charge. Now that is service.

<Content>If you want to see the real Bali, stay here If you want to see the real Bali, stay at the Tegal Sari.Located about an hour's drive from the airport, it is just outside Ubud in the cultural center of Bali. I stayed here for three nights in January 2008, then proceeded on to stay 3 nights at the Ritz Carlton in Bali. Before the first day at the Ritz was over, I hated it so much I was ready to go back to the Tegal Sari in Ubud. There is simply no comparison. The Ritz sux. The Tegal Sari rules.The staff at the Tegal Sari is genuinely friendly, and they go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. I do have to say the rooms are not the nicest I have stayed in (they are fine, just don't expect a 5-star hotel room - you are on a rice field, so expect a few bugs from time to time), but the experience and people are what make it special. The view from most of the rooms overlooks a rice field, and you can easily walk into Ubud for food and shopping. The staff will also drop you off and pick you up anywhere in Ubud at no charge, on your schedule. The Tegal Sari also owns a spa which is a short 3-minute drive away (they take you there), which is also very good and inexpensive ($10 or less per hour massage).The prices in the mini bar in your room are reasonable (40 cents for a coke or $1 for a beer for example), and they will do your laundry for you (I had 5 shirts, 3 pants and many pairs of underwear washed and the charge was about $2.00 total).You can eat at Tegal Sari, or several restaurants are within walking distance (or they will drop you off and pick you up). You can eat dinner for under $10 a person, including drinks and dessert. One of the best restaurants on the island (some say in all of the region) is also nearby in Ubud. You get what amounts to an eight course dinner of fine dining in a garden restaurant for about $50. The restaurant is called Mosaic, and I recommend you give it a try if you want to splurge.You can rent a scooter or bike from the hotel to explore the area around Ubud if you want, go rafting or visit nearby crafts villages. There are also nightly Balinese dances (several to choose from each night) you can go to as well. If you need to call home, you can call anywhere in the world with their phone from your room for about $1/minute, billed to your room.Breakfast is included, which they serve in their small restaurant or will bring to your room at no charge.If you are looking to party or sit in your room and watch TV, this hotel is not for you. If you want a true Bali experience hosted by one of the nicest hotel staffs in the world, then book your stay at the Tegal Sari now.

<Content>Tegal Sari is a dream I have just returned from Bali 2 days ago 18/11/07  spent 8 nights at the Tegal Sari. My first impression of the reception was a bit daunting as it is under thatching  looks unimpressive but all the reviews that I read here on the trip advisor are correct. This place was a dream. The rooms (super deluxe - bottom floor) were fabulously large  clean. We had the most impressive view  were literally 2.5 mts from the rice fields where we were able to watch the farmers work from dawn to dusk -  being keen photographers we had a ball. Breakfast on the verandah was a delight (banana pancakes yum) , but there is also a heavenly bakery across the road who serves scrumptious fare. A supermarket is just a little up the road  there is a wine shop out front who sells Aussie wines for the same price as Oz. The walk to central Ubud only takes 25mins  it is only a 10 minute walk to Monkey Forrest. The best thing is the staff. They go out of the way to make you comfortable  welcomed. They also give free transport drop off  pick up which we used every day for free. They were always happy to help. Internet is available with quick connections. A definite return place for me. 10 stars.

<Content>Paradise re-visited Stayed for 2 nights late October. Second time this year. Friend came to Bali with me for the first time and fell in love with Bali and especially Tegal Sari. Had one of the older super deluxe rooms and was very happy with it. Staff couldn't do enough for you . Would not stay anywhere else. Warung Enak almost next door is also well worth a visit.

<Content>Best Service In Bali My family (2 adults, 2 children- 5  7) have just returned from 3 weeks travelling around Bali. Our stay in Ubud was memorable especially because of the Tegal Sari. The rooms (we booked a super deluxe room online before leaving Aust.), food, ambience and service were outstanding. Thankyou TA for the tip and congratulations Tegal Sari on a job well done!

<Content>My stay at TEgal Sari ruined my whole trip.... After reading the online reviews I was pretty confident in giving this place a try. A bit scary because you can only book the place from the website and had to prepay everything beforehand.But I must say at the end this place truly was much much better than advertised.I can safely say that this must be one of the best hotels I ever stayed in.Not just in value, but also in atmosphere, class and all out service.I was really sad that I only stayed here for two days.I stayed at the Superdeluxe wooden room. It's actually the top half of a whole balinese Villa.The interior was all very beautifull. WIth a huge high end bathroom.Bath tub was enough for two with a view to the rice paddies.We got a huge 4 poster bed.Utterly romantic with curtains down.Outside was a large veranda/terrace overlooking the gorgeous rice paddies and the monkey forest. Simply wonderfull views. The best part of the place is the breakfast. You can choose several breakfast sets.From fried rice to pancakes.The hotel offers possiblilty to getting the breakfast in the restaurant OR get it served at your terrace. Well nothing beats a morning breakfast at your terrace overlooking that wonderfull scenery.SIMPLY wonderfull.An unbeatable experience.And then I haven't taken into account the superb service that we got from the personnel or the free ubud pickup service.Just a bit of warning...this hotel was so great that it basically ruined the whole holiday.All other hotels I stayed in paled in comparison to Tegal Sari....making them all feel second class. Even Alam Kul Kul fails to approach Tegal Sari.Simply put one of the best holiday stays i ever had.

<Content>Lovely Place - Will Stay There Again This tiny hotel was a gem in Ubud. Surrounded by rice paddies and lush tropical foliage, it was a charming and peaceful place. Its staff was super-attentive and friendly providing 5-star hotel service. We stayed at the Deluxe Room which was simple and cozy. Outside the room, there was a small patio overlooking the rice fields 鈥?a great place to enjoy breakfast and chill out in the evening.The hotel offered shuttle bus service to the city center. We called for the shuttle after dinner (after 10:00 p.m.) and did not have to wait for too long. However, in the morning (between 8-11 a.m.), the shuttle might be hard to come by as everybody was going out at that time.The breakfast was very average, but I tried one of their entrees at lunch and the quality was high.The only complaint I had was their slightly worn out towels and shower curtain. They need to replace them more frequently.

<Content>Everything it is made out to be! I would highly recommend the Tegal Sari in room 19 on the ground floor. There were four of us, (2A 2C) and they squeezed another bed (not a foldabed) in. We only stayed one night (unfortunately) so we didn't find it too cramped, but if you were staying longer you might find this a bit squishy. This is no reflection on the hotel itself though. Everything was fresh and clean, the best beds we had slept on. Loved the extra large bathroom with bath (great for the kids, especially after they fell in the rice paddies). The mozzies were a bit of a problem but they had thought of that with supplying mozzie candles. We organised our transfers to and from Kuta with them and they were perfectly on time and very informative when we asked questions. The other bonus was that they offered free transfer within the Ubud area. Give them 15mins notice and you were on your way. Absolutely every staff member was unreproachably friendly and treated us like kings and queens. Thank You!

<Content>5 star service, room needs to be updated Incredible service, better than in some of the 5 star hotels we stayed in during our honeymoon in Indonesia. We stayed in the wooden room and found it quite dark and the bathroom definetely needed an update. The basin was cracked and we couldn't use the big bath; we tried to use it twice and the hot water run out. Maybe we were unlucky with the room? I don't know. The view from the terrace was amazing though. I would go back, but I would book one of the newer rooms. Overall, a nice experience, top notch service.

<Content>Thank you, TripAdvisor! Thank you Trip Advisor for this recommendation! My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights. It was the perfect launching point to explore Ubud and an ideal place to relax before heading out for the day. We stayed in the 2 story Duplex. It was impeccably clean and the staff did an excellent job of providing quality room, laundry and maid service. The bedroom had 2 large windows which each opened onto balconies perfect for watching the sunrise on one side and sunset on the other. We had breakfast delivered every day - it was simple but fulfilling (fruit or juice and an egg dish). The room overlooked the lush rice paddies which allowed for a unique hotel experience and counteracts the mediocre grounds of the hotel itself. As for replenishing the cheap snacks, food or beer, the staff is happy to accommodate and will deliver anything you want to your room. For those looking for an active nightlife, Ubud is not your place. We enjoyed a few nice dinners (I recommend the all-you-can-eat buffet at Kutet鈥檚 Place), but the bars close around midnight and the hotel is nowhere near any action. I would not recommend this place for people looking to party, but it's great for those looking for a quiet, inexpensive spot that's walking distance to downtown Ubud and the Monkey Forest.

<Content>Another amazing stay We stayed in the wooden room upstairs. Well worth the price. The rice field views are wonderful. The staff was outstanding again. Always ready to serve. They even drove my glasses in to Denpasar to get them repaired. They were always available to give us rides into town and back to the hotel. A very appreciated service. The tour they arrranged of the rice fields and fruit groves was exceptional.

<Content>Excellent Stay at Tegal Sari When we checked into Tegal Sari there wasn't anything spectacular. When they show you to your room, and walk past the beautiful rice fields, you realize how beautiful the place is. We stayed in the Wooden Room upstairs and enjoyed a great view everytime we looked out our window.The staff of 21 or 22 people are really kind and speak English very well. They provide rides to UBUD centre almost anytime you want and provide a pickup service. Ubud Centre is a nice walk from Tegal Sari too....only a 10 minute walk to the Monkey Forest and a bunch of Tourist shops/ restuarants.  The complimentry breakfast was tasty and was delivered to our room every morning. (I love Nasi Goreng in the morning with fresh Juice) The laundry service was ultra cheap (I think under 50cents US per shirt). We also got a one hour Balinese massage in the room there for only approx 85000 Rupiah. (Approx 10 US Dollars) I recommend this place to anyone who wants to go to a Quiet hotel for a couple of days in UBUD. We stayed here 2 nights and wished we had 1 or 2 more.Patrick(Vancouver, BC - Honeymoon in Bali July 24-Aug 4 2007)

<Content>Unbelievable value We just returned from an 8-day trip on Bali. Our first three nights we spent at Tegal Sari in Ubud. The hotel is very popular, so, even though I made reservations in advance, the kind of room I requested (Super Deluxe Room) was available only for the last of the 3 nights. So, the first 2 nights we had to settle for a more modest room (Superior Room). The hotel was the only one of the four hotels we stayed in that charged the full amount at the time of reservation, i.e., a few months prior to our arrival. Its cancelation policy is rather strict, as well. Nevertheless, I believe it well worth it. The accomodations, particurly the Super Deluxe Room that we spent our last night in, are terrific. The smaller Superior Room is not bad either, it has everything you would expect from a standard hotel room, plus a balcony with an amazing view. Actually, all rooms have great view. The hotel is spread along the rice fields and the views, particularly in the morning and at the sunset are just unbelievable. The service is outstanding. The location in relation to the town is very convinient.

<Content>"Just awesome" I found this accomodation on trip advisor. It was everything they had said and more, because you cannot convey the feeling in words that you enjoy when you are there. The food was great, the staff were fantastic, location beautiful, atmosphere perfect, rooms were spotless, the view is just spectacular.My fifteen year old son accompanied me and enjoyed it as much as I did. I went back alone after my son returned home and just completely relaxed and soaked up the atmosphere. Absolutely the BEST.

<Content>Superb Service with a smile Have been to Ubud a number of times  decided to try Tegal Sari due to good reports from Tripadvisor, so had a week here in June. Great value  can't get any closer to rice paddies!! - it is in them! Suprisingly we didn't encounter mosquito problems. The staff were extremely friendly  their services including day trips,local activities,performance organisation,restuarant,bar fridge,laundry etc. were all reasonably priced  excellent. My travelling companion broke his arm while we were there  the staff looked after his medical service  needs with care  efficiency(even had a car waiting for him on release from Denpasar hospital).Would highly recommend Tegal Sari for a real Bali experience including Balinese hospitality,service  smiles!

<Content>Fantastic! Awesome! Business associates in Ubud booked this amazing room for us. When we were given the name, Tegal Sari, I looked it up and was excited to see so many postive comments. Everyone was right! Service was tremendous, the pool was wonderfully relaxing after a hot day of travelling and the overall ambiance was everything that I had hoped for. I would most definitely stay here again and would highly recommend that you do the same!

<Content>Wonderful place for very reasonable price My husband and I stayed at Tegal Sari from June 21 - 26, 2007 (last week). We loved it. All the good things everyone said on this forum is true. This is very reasonably priced accomodation for what you get (~$67 Cdn/night). It's quaint, clean, and comfortable. The accomodation is situated right in the middle of idyllic rice fields. We felt so peaceful waking up to seeing farmers working in the distance in their rice fields every morning. My husband and I stayed in a Super Deluxe room (#12) on the 2nd floor (great view). When we arrived, we were greeted with iced drinks, and fantastic hospitality (great smiles). We later realized that this is typical for all Balinese. They are such gentle, gracious and kind people! The rooms were very clean. We had a mini fridge with beer and water (very reasonably priced), complimentary coffee and tea with kettle in the rooms. There was also a safe to store valuables, and cheap laundry services. Breakfast every day is included in the price. You can eat in their eating area/small restaurant or have it brought to your room. (They offered a choice of some Western options [ie: French toast, eggs, pancakes] or Indonesian [ie: Nasi/Mie Goreng]. The breakfast is made fresh. I must admit I'm in Seminyak right now and the Nasi Goreng in these posh bigger hotels can't beat the Nasi Goreng I've eaten at Tegal Sari. They also offer free transport to the Ubud Center (anytime you want). Other services offered include: day trip tours/with drivers, cooking classes and massages from an affiliated business called Pertinen. We wouldn't hesitate to come again the next time we're in Ubud. We recommend this place to everyone (esp. those on a budget). Two thumbs and two toes up for this place!!

<Content>Wonderful Place to Stay My partner and I stayed in Tegal Sari for 3 nights in June 07. It was absolutely wonderful and we loved it. We had a super deluxe room (no. 21) it had a king size bed plus a single bed, very comfortable indeed. The bathroom had a shower stall, huge shower head, plus a corner bath. Bathroom was stocked with shower gel, soaps etc. and fresh towels were provided each day. The room had a fridge and kettle (with free coffee and tea), 2 free bottles of water were put in the fridge each day, and the kettle water was topped up each day. The room contained a plug in mosquito repellant plus a mosquito coil for the terrace. The breakfast is the usual sort of thing, egg cooked any way you like, toast, freshly squeezed juices (pineapple, watermelon, orange, papaya etc.) it was very nice and another nice thing is that they can deliver it to your terrace or balcony, breakfast is from 7 - 11 am. It is really very beautiful and very special place to stay. The only thing I will say is that if you are a light sleeper keep in mind that once the sun goes down the insect orchestra starts, the noise is quite something, the insects plus the geckos plus the frogs plus the ducks etc. make a bit of a racket and that goes on until sunrise. While in Ubud we went to the Bebek Bengil restaurant (Dirty Duck) which is recommended - we thought it was very overrated, the location is lovely however the duck which is their signature dish is just a very small half of a duck deep fried to death served with the hottest chili sauce I have every tasted (and I like hot stuff), the service was indifferent and I would not recommend. The restaurant I would recommend is called Nomad - absolutely fabulous food, beautiful layout, floor cushions and low tables, and very good value with wonderful service. All in all I would recommend Ubud, and will go back to Tegal Sari for more that 3 days next time.

<Content>Glad our friends recommended it! We LOVED Tegal Sari in Ubud (www.tegalsari-ubud.com) Ubud is a fantastic place. Affordable, less crowded, etc. Tegal Sari is lovely with nice (not luxurious) rooms and great views. Our room overlooked a rice patty. It is a 15 minute walk from town and 10 minutes to the monkey forest. So, out of the way, but not TOO out of the way. The staff were really accommodating and gave great customer service. We were celebrating our honeymoon, and the staff left us a huge basket of flowers with a lovely note with well wishes for a great honeymoon. We still get emails from them wishing us happy birthdays every year! We booked this hotel on recommendation of some friends who had been there a few months before and we were not disappointed.

<Content>Very nice place We stayed in Tegal Sari in April with our 2 daughters of 7 and 10 years old. We had the wooden room, which was on the first floor and offered us a wonderful vieuw over the rice fields. The hotel is small and cosy and personel is very helpful. It'is also a relaxing place considering the hustle and bustle of Ubud city.The only thing which could be improved, was breakfast. But we found that to be a general problem in most (small) hotels in Bali. It's hard to find a good coffee, fresh bread or a nice omelet. The choice was quite limited: we ended up eating pancakes for breakfast every day.I booked Tegal Sari because of all the wonderful reviews and I can honestly say that, except for breakfast, it lived up to our expectations.

<Content>Great! Booked this hotel using it's own website. We arranged to be collected from the airport by the hotel's own transport, the transfer took about an hour and cost 175000 Rp. Upon arrival we were presented with a free glass of ice tea and given a tour of the hotel, which didn't take long. The hotel consists of 14 rooms, a small restaurant, small pool, outdoor exercise area, massage area and overlooks the rice paddy fields. We opted for a Super Deluxe Room on the first floor; the room was very large, containing king size bed, wardrobe, mini-bar (which was very cheap), air conditioning, ceiling fan. The bathroom was large with a bath and walk in shower. Both rooms were spotlessly clean. The icing on the cake was the large balcony overlooking the fields, just great for relaxing on. For breakfast, you could eat in the restaurant or phone reception and ask for it to be delivered to your room (no extra cost). Generally took about 15 minutes to arrive if you asked for it to be delivered. Choice of breakfast was good for a 3 day stay, any longer and you may start to get a bit bored. The hotel provides free transport into the centre of Ubud, about 1.5 km away (about a 20 min walk), all they ask is that you give them about 15 minutes notice. The staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English.Around the hotel are a number of cafes and restaurants, and it's very close to the ARMA museum. About 3-4 minutes walk away is a decent size mini market that contains an ATM. The area around the hotel is a bit quiet, and on a couple of occasions we were the only ones eating/drinking in places. However, if you head down nearby Monkey Forest Road, there are slightly busier places there. The hotel provides a list of dancing shows available nightly in Ubud, and will take you there. Cost varied between 50000 and 80000Rp to watch the show.Overall, an excellent hotel which I wouldn't hesitate to stay in again.

<Content>Unique Experience This is for a unique ambiance other than the beach. It is located in the middle of the rice field. Unfortunately, we were there right after the harvest so we missed the view. The hotel is close to the Monkey Forest and the famous restaurant Dirty Duck. We like what we got for the price!!

<Content>Great ambience, friendly staff but room #1 is tired-looking We stayed for 3 nights during the last week of March, 2 at the standard room #1 and 1 at the duplex with jacuzzi (#14). The std room we were in was clean but needed some urgent upgrading. For USD35 however, we were not complaining.We actually arrived late at night (9 p.m.) but the check-in was fast. The front-desk staff took us to our room and spent at least 10 mins letting us know about the services made available by Tegal Sari. Great service, really.The surrounding of the hotel is nice too - so many past TA reviewers already talked about the rice fields, great views from the balcony etc. so I am not going to repeat those comments here.The duplex at USD60 is worth it if you are spending a lot of time in your room. The layout of the room however is a little strange. On the first floor, when you open the main door from outside, you will be greeted by the open-plan bathroom (by this, I mean the toilet bowl). It's therefore not very convenient for you to use it if you have ordered room service :-) The fridge (the size of those we have in our kitchens back home) is NOT in the room, it is instead outside, at the terrace. In addition, the stairs to the second floor (when the bed is) are rather steepl. Before we left, we tried to see if we could have a look at some of the newer rooms (super wooden, etc.) but were told that the guests were inside the rooms. What a pity!All in all, a pleasant stay. I will return to Tegal Sari for the location is great and the staff are really friendly.By the way, the Lemak is a great restaurant with great food and nice ambience. They will also send you back to Tegal Sari in their very own vehicle!

<Content>wonderful stay! We stayed in Tegal Sari from Feb 27th till 2nd March, first 3 nights with wooden rooms and the last nights with 2 Super Delux Rooms. I especially loved the wooden room for the natural materials that they use. Staffs are all so friendly and try their very best to accomplish as much as possible. breakfast can be a bit more but feel free to order more stuff since the price is real low, the same goes for the mini-bar and the laundary service. We also booked our trecking trip with Tegal Sari, they sent their own staff as driver and guide, the trip was wonderful, definitely recommend to those who want to go to the wild and see the real life of bali (it is a real treck so wear proper shoes and clothing). Ubud in genenral has a lot to offer, a day-trip from the south coast is far from enough I would say. And in general, the atmosphere in Ubud is so different from the south, people are much more relaxed and climat is a bit more pleasant as well.

<Content>Absolutely LOVED Tegal Sari I would definitely stay at Tegal Sari again! not only were the rooms clean and nice with a wonderful view, the staff was incredible. Everyone at Tegal Sari were very welcoming, accomodating and friendly. The location of the hotel was great too. It was within walking distance to alot of attractions. I liked that it wasn't on the busy Monkey Forest street. It was one of the best place I have stayed so far. Still raving about it to friends.

<Content>Tegal Sari, I will be back again!!! Tegal Sari is one of the best place that I have ever stayed so far. The staffs are so friendly, even though their rooms are fully booked, they still bring us around to look at their rooms. It make both my husband and myself go back again to try our luck another day to see if we can get a room. We were lucky enough to get a room on the second try. As it was my husband bird-day, the staffs brought a birthday cake to our room and sang him a birthday song. We are really suprised for their excellent service. Their resturant food is also very nice. We really enjoy our stay there altot it is only 1 night. We will be back, wait for us!!!

<Content>Confirm this is great I stayed 5 days in April 2006. I based my decison to stay on reviews here. Was not wrong. A bit far from the town centre but this adds to the peace and quiet. Also, the free unlimited town drop  pick up service makes distance irrelevant. The challenge will be to keep the newish looking units looking this way in years to come. KT

<Content>Tegal Sari - A Gem in the Rice Fields We stayed four nights at the Tegal Sari during our three week honeymoon to Bali. We also stayed at a villa in Seminiyak, Honeymoon Guesthouse and the awesome Alam Shanti, but we LOVED Tegal Sari the best! We had room #11, a Super Deluxe at $45 USD per night. The terrace was right on the rice field, so close the rice farmers sat on our fence while contemplating their crops. There were ducks in the morning, frogs at night and the most beautiful sunsets we ever saw our whole stay in Bali. The staff was five-star, the anticipated your every need and were right there when you needed them, but yet gave you privacy as well. My husband and I both work in the tourist industry at large hotels in Maui, so we know about hotel service. Tegal Sari was outstanding. Can't recommend it enough. Try for rooms 22, 24 or 26, the upper levels of the new buildings. Awesome views.Two thumbs up for Tegal Sari.

<Content>Amazing value, amazing experience The Tegal Sari excelled on every level, and created a magical few days for us in Ubud. No need to look any further than this hotel - we searched for days and although you could pay ten times the price, you won't find something as perfect for such great value.We booked the Super Deluxe room, which was still only about 拢26 for the room and breakfast for the night. From the moment we arrived, the staff were professional, offered superb customer service and a warmth you can't replicate. The room was lovely - clean, a big bathroom and with a beautiful view onto the rice paddies.There's a lovely stone-bottomed swimming pool, little gym and they have links with a great and good value spa. Or you can get massages by the pool.The hotel's location is also great - a 20 minute walk to the town centre, but surrounded by bars, shops and restaurants, although you feel completely tranquil and isolated as you're in the middle of rice paddies.Overall, you could certainly spend much more for five star luxuryhotels, but I would save your money and have a more personalised, unique experience at the Tegal Sari for incredible value.

<Content>Thanks 'Trip advisor', it was the best place I stayed in I followed trip advisor's recommendations. I was not disappointed. Nice place, clean, perfect position, friendly staff, free shuttle service to Ubud whenever you wanted, more than reasonable priced rooms, mini bar, restaurant etc....Tegal Sari in reality is much better than the photos on their web site.The only mistake we made was to stay only 3 nights. Next time we will book at least 5 nights. There is just so much to do and see in Ubud.

<Content>Great Value for the Money Tegal Sari is lovely hotel. My wife and I stayed there are 3-days in the middle of our honeymoon. It was the cheapest resort we stayed in and it was just as nice. The facilities are as nice as the pictures show. I stayed in the Duplex room which is the nicest room they have. It was a very large room with 2 balconies and a jacuzzi tub. The tub was nice, but different than I expected. Not as deep as I thought it would be. The staff there was really nice and were very helpful. They were willing to drive us anywhere we wanted to go in Ubud for free and would also pick us up. The food as just okay, but it was also very cheap. The cokes in the refrig in our room only cost 3,500 or about $0.40 cents american. The ice cream was also very good and well as some of the dinners. This is definetly the most bang for your buck that I stayed at.

<Content>Peaceful view of the rice paddies, excellent staff services With so many choices of nice places to stay in Bali, it's difficult deciding where to stay. We booked 6 nights at theTegal Sari in Room #10 in the old wing. While the room itself is very simple (just like in the picture on their web site), the setting made it the perfect place for us. I was very content and happy with my choice.The location is an excellent combination of proximity to central Ubud and yet still away from the busy street and next to the rice fields. The hotel is close to several different restaurants within walking distance: Dirty Duck, Barundi, Three Monkeys, and many others. The hotel is also close to the ARMA museum. There is a small liquor shop near their driveway entrance. Free transporation within Ubud provided. The swimming pool is check regularly for cleanliness and is very refreshing.Because their prices are low, you should consider adding more time to your vacation here. Then you will have more time to savor the local culture and more money to spend on buying art. Two cautions:1. The steps to the second floor room 10 are steep and not for the elderly.2. While the breakfast is excellent and brought to your room,we did not like the atmosphere or the food at their little mini-cafe on the premises next to the registration area. We ate there the first night, but never again.

<Content>GREAT place to stay Gosh... I can't add too much to what everyone else is saying.Service was super compared to almost everywhere else I've been.The rooms/bathrooms (super deluxe) were beautiful.Food was delicious.Took the cooking class and that was tremendous, delicious fun.Downsides:- Is it is hard to get rooms. We were able to get 4 nights but had to switch rooms in the middle. But they moved our bags while we were River Rafting, and even re-hung our wet bathing suits.- Location is a little far, but that was also a plus because it was so quite and peaceful.

<Content>Wonderful experience We stayed in the Tegal Sari from September 5-10, 2006 in room 12. It was our first time in Bali and we were picked up by a member of the hotel staff from the airport after a very long flight from Europe. There were no mix-ups, he was already waiting for us and drove us to the hotel. We were received by very welcoming and smiling staff, who greeted us by name. After a short tour of the hotel grounds we were shown to our room, which was lovely. It had a view of the rice fields from every window. The balcony was large and comfortable and a good place to sit in the evening or in the early morning when there was still a little haze over the rice fields and the Monkey Forest.Everything we needed was in the room. The rainshower was wonderful and there were more than enough drawers and cupboards in the room and bathroom for all our things. And we are not light travellers! The first afternoon we just lazed around the hotel and had a massage (It was so relaxing I fell asleep halfway). That evening we had dinner in the hotel, which was quite good (chicken salad and sate).The other evenings we had dinner outside, but we could always phone for a pick-up back to the hotel. The staff were very attentive, always smiling, always greeting us by name, they really could not do enough for you. We booked a cycling tour through them and they use a very good and safe tour company, we had a wonderful day. The grounds around the hotel are also very nice: little gardens, a nice pool area, ponds, bales, statues, nice hidden corners everywhere.Everything was very clean and well taken care of. After five days we had to leave to continue our trip around Bali, but we left this hotel with lots of regrets.The price of the rooms is very good, but the kindness and attention to detail of the staff (and really all of them!) is priceless.

<Content>Is this the best value for money hotel in all Bali if not SE Asia? This hotel is perfect for me. I can honestly say i would consider flying to bali from london ESPECIALLY to stay in this hotel, i don't even need to see any other hotels! I have stayed in a 5 star hotel in bangkok and honestly the service at tegal sari rivals 5 star service (except i didn't get all these free gifts and things which i don't really need anyway). I received the warmest welcome at 11pm when i arrived and the chef cooked me a dinner even though the restaurant should have shut. They drove me around ubud for free and picked me up whenever i called them. They helped me find alternative accomodation when they were fully booked. As a solo female traveller i felt totally safe here. no creepy staff trying to sell you things or flirting with you.the rooms are simple but stylish, VERY clean and bathrooms are spotless and look new. there is no tv which in my opinion is great. beds are super comfy. the pool is beautiful and doesn't have that farty smell that some pools have. gardens are wonderfully landscaped flowers everywhere and everything is carefully tended to and feels CLEAN. but the real clincher is the vast green rice paddies surrounding the place..so pretty, its like you walked into a postcard. just really calming scenery.i am a bit worried that i might not be able to ge a room next time i want to say.in short ..this hotel is proof that 5 star hotels don't have to charge ridiculous prices. lots of good vibes and good results coming from this place. hope they open hotels in other beautiful places. i'll be back as often as possible.

<Content>Royal treatment in a beautiful setting From end of July until mid August, we have been touring in Bali and Lombok and stayed at around 6 hotels. Tegal Sari is really exceptional on so many levels. First of all : price of rooms is really low. We stayed in the duplex room (room 14) and a new super deluxe room (number 19) and paid for these rooms around 40 to 45 euro per room per night, breakfast included. I booked at hotel directly (and had to pay full amount) around 10 months in advance, since these rooms are indeed in high demand. When you consider then what you get for this money, I am sure this must be the best value for money I have ever experienced. The rooms itself are nicely decorated, very clean and everything is functioning well (also the low-noise airco). The service you get ? Well.... very difficult to put in wording how they succeed in making you feel like royalty. Of course there is the 'shuttle service' which is more like a 'private limo' service in my opinion, but all requests I had were handled so professionally and fast.... unbelievable. I heard that Tegal Sari is owned by the people who work in the hotel. While other 5-star properties are often struggling to lift service levels, it is simply amazing to see how employees know which buttons to push to make you feel like royalty. And they do it in the most natural way. For your info : we stayed also in Maya Ubud, one of the luxury hotels in Ubud, where we paid around 220 euro for a room. Really great too, but I don't even start comparing value-for-money. When you get a unbelievable experience for 40 euro per night instead of 220 euro, it tastes so much sweeter....Concerning rooms : if duplex is booked (there is only one), I would definitely go for the new super deluxe rooms (number 19 to 24). Property layout is like a 'L' with entrance / reception / restaurant at top tof L and new super deluxe rooms are bottom line of L. They consist of three buildings with each time a room on ground floor and a second on first floor. There are a bit isolated and offer the best wide views over the rice fields. Room 19, 21 and 23 are on ground floor, while 20, 22 and 24 are on first floor. Rooms 23 and 24 are in one building and at the extreme end of the property. Hope this clear ! Last restaurant tip : Caf茅 des Artistes, Belgian owned restaurant, but with a very international menu. Great quality (try the steak !!!) at very affordable prices.

<Content>Nature with a touch of luxury This is a place to escape the buzz of the city. There was no TV in our room (super deluxe) to my husband's consternation (World Cup season). Our 4 year old twins did get rather bored but did manage to amuse themselves catching ladybirds and soaking in the bath tub. Pity it was raining continuously so we could not use the pool as inviting as it looked. Outdoor massage was good and cheap. Food is so-so; local cuisine is better than Western. But not to worry - just 300 metres down the road is the fantabulous Dirty Duck restaurant. Although it was full house, staff were attentive. We were shuttled into/from Ubud town free of charge anytime of the day. Laundry is really cheap - eleven pieces of clothing cost me USD2, returned within the day sweetly scented. The surroundings alone are worth paying for. Imagine waking up to the sound of ducks and birds, watching farmers toiling in the rice fields, village women swishing by with baskets upon their head; at night time to be lulled to sleep by the strangely comforting orchestra of frogs and crickets. I liked the fact that I wasn't in central Ubud, yet near enough for a longish stroll down Monkey Forest Rd.

<Content>Great stay at Tegal Sari! My husband and I stayed at Tegal Sari for two nights. We wanted the wooden room, but it was not available, so we got the regular room at a lower price. The resort was very cute - the rice paddy view is amazing and the restaurant had great food. We had the nasi campur - a lot of different tastes from Bali. It was fabulous and quite reasonable. The hotel service was very good except for the first night's ride into town - they waited for other guests to go to the Legong dance, and we were almost late. Other than that, the service was impeccable. Staff was very friendly and the pool was beautiful. We got massages by the pool outdoors - for a very reasonable IDR 75000/person. They also did take us everywhere we wanted to go in town with their shuttle bus and picked us up as well. Also, we were able to walk to the monkey forest - what a fabulous visit. I would recommend this hotel for peace and quiet and a change from the hustle and bustle of Kuta.

<Content>You'll love it! What a gem of a hotel! This locally owned, beautiful little hotel is set amongst rice paddies and away from the road, but is still close to everything. We really emjoyed our stay here and will stay again. There is no other hotel in Ubud that gives you such value for money. Their mazing rates include a nice little breakfast and amazing views. We just loved watching the Balinese working the rice paddies, and watched them search for eels by the light of lanterns at night.The rooms themselves are great - we stayed in super-deluxe rated room 8. The beds were divine and the bathroom just gorgeous, and all very clean.It's such a firendly little resort, with a small but beautiful stone pool, and both the pool and the outdoor gym have views of rice paddies on both sides.We took the rice paddy trek  just loved it. I'm not super-fit at all, and I did it quite easily, so it's not too arduous, and it was just fascinating. We met local farmers  ate fresh pineapple straight off the tree, and drank coconut milk from a coconut that one of the farmers climbed up to get.I must also mention that the room service is cheaper than any other hotel I've encountered - the fridge in the room is stocked with softdrink that's US$1ea, and the food is similarly priced.Great value, anyone considering going there I'm sure would be very happy with the Tegal Sari.

<Content>Blissfull my stay at Tegal Sari Would just like to stay that after many times to Bali, I had the pleasure of staying at Tegal Sari. My only problem was that I couldn't stay longer. Spent 3 absolutely beautiful nights in the peaceful grounds of this establishment. Staff, lovely, surroundings, totally relaxing, that's all I wanted...Can't wait to be back in that little pocket of paradise.Terema kasih.Katy FrenchP.S. See you in a couple of weeks.
