<Content>I wouldn't go back stayed before 2004 Wow I was reading the reviews and some things never change.We were there mega years ago. Check in was ok but our room was far from everything so we went to the front desk and they did change our room. Gave us room# and keys. The only problem was we had to carry our own luggages to the new room,which was a long walk. ( We didn't have those new roll ones which are easier today!!) Food was ok we are not picky eaters and we don't drink .We are beach people but the beach was nice but we found it too breezy so we had to stay by the pool daily.Room service was unreal. I don't speak Spanish so all I got in the morning was cafe!! the only thing they understood when I tried to order. The little book they gave me for Spanish words did not help.Maids didn't speak or understand any English so whatever I need or try to get was not resolved. I tried to tell them I didn't want flowers in bathroom etc cause they had small insects on them and had to kill them . Only place at the time was at the resturants which understood me or the front desk..Good things are the grounds, the rooms and some of the entertainment at night!!I wrote to them directly about the language barrier and they replied they will be getting help who could relate to tourist!!Have they???

<Content>Loved the Paradisus Punta Cana!!!!!! CHRISTMAS AT THE PARADISUS PUNTA CANA 鈥?December 20 to 27th(several tropical storms on the 24th(all day), 25th and 26th (in and out) but the there was plenty to do and on Christmas Day Santa visited all the younger kids in the lobby and on the beach with some wonderful gifts from what we could see 鈥?we have teenagers)Love this resort, the Dominican Republic and its people! Here are some of our impressions of the resort ...Appearance - indescribably gorgeous. The public spaces (lobby) are huge, open, airy, and inviting. There's comfortable seating (large cushion beds) and tables everywhere; areas are lushly planted; multiple fountains, plus incense and candles LOTS OF CANDLES!Grounds- wow! If you love plants, you're going to really enjoy strolling around the grounds. Huge variety of mature, interesting tropical plants, palm trees and many others of course (don't know what they are called). Attractive walkways, bridges, gazebos. The staff were out early every morning and they kept the property looking absolutely amazing even after the storms came in.Rooms - very large with an open feeling attractively decorated. Good sized seating area. The bathroom, even though not overly large was comfortable enough with separate toilet and shower room. Nice patio with seating and garden/pond view, in our case. Beach - one of the windiest I've ever been on (could be the time of year), but extremely pretty. Seaweed is cleared off the beach early in the morning. There were numerous palm trees, dozens of pretty palm-thatched beach shelters and lots of wonderful sand. We walked a very long distance in both directions from our beach. Ours was by far the nicest On the beach, you will be accosted by many, mostly friendly merchants trying to get you to buy their cigars, jewellery etc. If you're not interested, politely say so and they will move on their way. Food / Restaurants - now that I have visited this hotel, can't understand the reviews I read before travelling which criticized some of the food. Did you stay at the same resort we did? We were all so impressed by the food choices. They also take great care to keep the hot food hot and the cold food cold. Felt extremely confident with the food safety here. They have a water filtration system in the resort for the drinking water, washing the fruits and vegetables and for making the ice cubes.You can always find something interesting to eat:Breakfast: buffet (Hibiscus) featuring cold meats, cheeses, variety of rotating hot dishes (eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes), all kinds of baked goods (muffins, croissants, toast, etc.), yogurt, fruit, and more - not to mention the made to order omelette / egg grill. My son loved the fruit smoothie bar!Lunch: Market Grill is another beautiful eatery which is more exposed to relaxing ocean breeze: they have made-to-order grilled food - burgers and hot dogs, along with the buffet offering again a large selection of salads and pasta bar. Both areas have extensive dessert choices, including delicious ice cream.Dinner: 11 restaurants to choose from, not all available each night 鈥?need reservations unless going to the buffet. Even if it鈥檚 not required to reserve do it anyways 鈥?long wait otherwise 鈥?know from experience (Steak House). The French and Latin restaurants were both extremely good. Great service, relaxing atmosphere. ! The formal restaurants make a nice change from all-you-can-eat buffet eating all the time! They have room service also, 24 hours as our teenagers found out and just loved. We would order wine and beer that way for our bar fridge as it was just filled with water and pop.Staff:Maid - We followed advice and first day left tip for our maid service. Our service was good, difficult time trying to get face cloths 鈥?kept receiving many towels (language barrier) but satisfied with service overall. Bar Staff / Servers / Hosts - amazingly friendly people, very attentive. Lots of drinks, and plenty of different ones.Activities: plenty to do, on and off property. Constant calendar of planned activities at pool and beach if you were inclined to do so 鈥?our kids enjoyed as we just relaxed. Off resort we went on the Marinarium Cruise on Christmas Day 鈥?so much fun and fabulous staff to entertain you. Snorkelling with the sharks and stingrays, partying on a sand dune by a secluded beach and dancing the Meringa on the boat 鈥?even with a tropical storm appearing on our way out, our spirits were not dampened and all was clear when the festivities started. Lots of drinks provided and light snacks. It was a great 1/2 day trip.Spa: There was a spa 鈥?looked wonderful but did not take in their services. Lobby shows every night - lots of dancing, amazing dancing - not everyone's cup of tea - my daughter and I enjoyed but my husband and son did not.Casino: Small Casino in lobby - few tables and machines - fun my big win $44 on the nickel machine LOLDisco: Teenager paradise - starts at 11:30 until 2 after the lobby music and shows end. Lots of security - felt comfortable with my kids being out in the resort on their own later at night.Main Pool: amazing, beautiful and very large! If you want a poolside bed, there are not many, and you have to be there early to get one, but there are plenty of lounge chairs. Miscellaneous: Insects - Bring your bug spray and use it! I don't think they were mosquitoes because I never felt the sting - just saw the bites on my legs afterwards.From reading the forum before we left, I would have to say that from what I saw and dealt with while we were away at this beautiful resort that when there's a problem, it's more about the TRAVELERS than the staff! :)

<Content>How could you not like this resort Just a liitle overview. We travel twice a year. We are a family of 5 Husband, wife, 19,17,14 - 2 girls and a boy. We always take 2 rooms. I was so nervous aftering reading all the negative reviews. I was not sure what to expect, we had been to some other all inclusives Moon Palace in Rivierva Maya and Iberostar Bavaro. I did not really like either one of them. We have also been on about 10 cruises with varoius cruise lines.Now for the review, We loved Paradisus, From the minute we entered the lobby it had a great warm feeling. What a beautiful lobby. Check in was a little tough. Between the language barrier and trying to select a room. If you can spend the money and upgrade to the reserve it is well worth it.. We stayed in the regular rooms we had 2 rooms, they were very nice not amazing. The grounds, pool, beach, was all very nice - first class. We had no problem making reservations and we were there during Christmas. We like the food in most of the restaurants. The breakfast buffet is the same everyday, but it is fine switch it up and try Terra one morning. Lunch was ok again buffet, try the Italian restauarant the Pizza and pasta was very good and they are open for lunch. Just leave yourself plenty of time sometimes they are slow. One day it took forever the next day we had 4 people waiting on us. Welcome to the Dominican Republic ha ha. The manager of the resort even came up to us one day to ask about what they can improve. I was impressed. We like the Japanese, Vento, and Brazilian Steak House the best. The only restaurant we did not like was Feugo, it was beatiful inside, but bad service and cold food that night. Others we spoke with loved it. I am in the food business and for me to say that the food was pretty good at an all inclusive resort is saying a lot. Again you have to keep in mind this is an all inclusive not the four seasons. Compared to the other all inclsives we stayed at the food was great.What can I say my family had a great time and the resort was beautiful. Foget all the review go and have fun. Go horeback riding, play volleyball or just relax. We did do one excursurion the ATV motor bike, it was really fun.Hope you enjoy your vacation as much as we enjoyed ours. Remember relax, enjoy and have fun.

<Content>Paradise in the Paradisus Reserve I was a guest in the Reserve section between Dec 28 and January 1. The accommodations were beautiful and throughout the resort I found the staff to be warm and genuinely interested in delivering good service. Language was sometimes a barrier, but we were able to manage and there were always smiles all around. We rode to and from the hotel with a couple who did not stay in the Reserve but who had nothing but good things to say about their experience. New Year's eve was a lot of fun as there was music, dancing and drinks on the beach with a fireworks display at midnight -- truly special. The food was sometimes great, sometimes just okay but I expected this (if you have been to an all inclusive or on a cruise then you know that this is often the case). There were a few hiccups including one that almost caused us to miss the special New Year's Eve dinner we were counting on. The staff were apologetic and made sure we were taken care of. All in all, I loved the resort and the Reserve experience. Mike a waiter for the Reserve section of the Beach and Dionisio in Gabi are the best!

<Content>A Belated Report-Wish I Had More Info Back Then I don't think I reviewed this after 7/06, but I'm not scrolling thru 710 entries to find out.My main consideration in choosing this resort was that it wasn't in a rainy season in July, unlike most parts of Mexico.Our trip started out bad, as we missed our plane (Delta wouldn't hold the door for 30 seconds) from Seattle, and had to wait until the next evening to fly. That was my fault. After arriving a day late, however, we found our bags had never made it, and wouldn't for another 2 days. Thanks again, Delta. The resort had an Oh, well attitude and only steered me toward their small clothing shop with ridiculiously overpriced shorts  t-shirts. Going off resort was strongly discouraged. When our luggage did finally arrive, I was never notified, and indeed, they put it in the wrong room. It was only after 4-5 trips to the front desk per day that they finally owned up to the error.Our greeter spent about 20% of her time introducing us to the amenites, and about 80% trying to sign us up for a timeshare presentation. Most of the staff spoke no english, and I'm sorry to say that my spanish wasn't up to the task, either, athough my daughter, who had just finished 2 years of high school spanish, had problems also.The food: Highlights, the various cheeses and fresh fruit. Also the banana and bleu cheese pizzas from the Italian restaurant.Lowlights: Practically everything else. Most of it was canned. I think we ate more pizza here than anything else. The formal restaurants were abysmal. Really made me miss the walking Mexican beach vendors with their fish and shrimp on a stick.The staff: Unhelpful at best. At worst, a barely hidden, simmering hostility. That was surprising to me, as I thought a resort job was about as good as gold in the DR. I think it's amusing to read of travelers from NY  NJ complaining about the Europeans and Russians behavior. We felt the same about them. Rudely and loudly barging ahead of people in lines and barking at servers like they owned the place. It made me understand a little of the staffer's attitude.One day we could take it no more and asked about any day trips outside the resort; my daughter wanted to pick up some souvenirs. We were told we had to hire a driver/bodyguard for the trip for something like $120. He spoke almost no english either, and drove us about 20 miles into town to 1 souvenir shop, 2 churches, and 1 version of a local K-Mart, then back to the resort. On our way back, just outside the resort grounds, I saw groups (safety in numbers) of tourists walking around a small tourist area. Off the resort, the DR did indeed look dangerous and extremely poor. If nothing else, I wrote it off as a learning experience for my daughter and I. She'd never seen poverty like this up close before, and it make her thankful for many things.To sum up, even with the beautiful beach, after 6 days we were more than happy to leave. When we got home, I booked a trip to an AI in Puerto Vallarta, and we more than made up for our Punta Cana experience.

<Content>Very Dissapointed Let's start with the positives because there weren't all that many. The beach and ocean are lovely (although not spectacular). The grounds are handsome and well manicured (although everything is spread out so you'll do a lot of walking). The staff is generally very warm (although largely disorganized and incompetent).Now that we've dispatched with the positives, let's enumerate thenegatives. The rooms are not just spartan, they are dingy. Our room had not been properly cleaned when we checked in. When we arrived we found large mold spores on our pillows; there was mold on the lamp shade aswell. You wake up in the morning feeling dirty.Smoking is pervasive at the resort and sometimes difficult to escape. For reaons we still do not understand the AC in our room dispensed cold air mixed with second hand smoke. It certainly added to the general nasty feel of the accomodations.Most of the guests were either Europeans or Russians (hence all the smoking). If you do not smoke, wear a gold chain or have a tatoo, you may feel out of place. The all inclsuive resort (this was only our second time at an all inclusive) seems to attract a more gluttonous and portly guest. I could easily stand to lose 10 pounds, but compared to many guests I looked like Adonis.The food was mediocre, which is about what you'd expect from an all inclusive. Honestly, for breakfast and lunch it's good enough if you are not a foody and when you have young kids all inclsuives are very appealing. The dinners, however, were truly dissapointing. I'd rather eat at an Olive Garden than all of the so called fancy restaraunts. Despite the fact that you are in the Caribbean, you can't get a good piece of fish anywhere at the resort. In fact, most of the fish on the menu isn't even tropical (think cod) so you know the hotel is just cooking the cheapest ingredients they can find.And then there's the childcare --- quality varies dramatically, so becareful. The Kids Zone is actually a very nice facility. We dropped our kids off on the first day and when we came back in the afternoon we found our 21 month old (who doesn't know how to swim) in the shallow end of the pool by himself with water wings on. The attendants were next to the pool watching, but no one was in the pool with him. The next day we told the staff no swimming and did not bring bathing suits. Overall, however, ourkids seemed to like the Kids Zone. The staff was very warm, but not quite as responsible as you'd like.We requested a babysitter to come in the evenings. On the first night the babysitter arrived a 7 and we put our two kids to sleep and dimmed the lights before leaving. But when we returned at 10, the lights were on and both of our kids were sitting on the couch watching TV with the babysitter. The babysitter spoke no English, so we're not sure what happened. The next night we requested a different babysitter and instructed no TV, just sleep. Things went according to plan.Two miscellenaous notes. Most of the staff doesn't speak English all that well, so if you don't speak Spanish communicating can be difficult. Also, Blackberry reception was spotty at best.

<Content>Great week for our family We had an amazing christmas break week! I'll try to break it down easily.....Check in was a breeze, no waiting and luggage brought right up to room. We stayed in The Reserve in a Family Concierge suite. The kids were give beach bags, hats and t shirts. The room was stocked with suncreen, robes and slippers for the kids and the refrig. had lots of snacks and drinks. Room was huge-2 double beds, jacuzzi tub, pull out couch, full shower, lots of closet and drawer space, balcony etc.Pool/Beach--Reserve pool is beautiful with couches, beds, comfy chairs and huts for shade. Pool has beds to lay on in water. We had our own bartender for the week who brought us everything. Pool has a full bar and grill. Kids zone is right there and the kids enjoyed it alot-they made projects, swam, played games and met alot of nice kids. Beach is not close to reserve but you can walk or take a tram--no big deal. Beach also had beds, chairs, huts etc. Beautiful beach-very clean and sand is so soft. Grounds--Gorgeous! Very lush. Lots of plants and trees. Very clean.Concierge-tip at beginning of week. He made all our dinner reservations, last minute spa reservation, arranged for a paper to be delivered and had milk and cookies sent to our room each nite. They are not your personal slaves and we found ours to be so helpful and great with the kids. A smile and kindness go a long way. Food-we enjoyed the sit down dinner-especially Japanese and Vento. Service is a little slower than home. Buffet does get repetitive for breakfast and lunch but it was never crowded on reserve side. We brought breakfast to the pool and ordered lunch from the grill. Shows/Lobby/Casino-Shows were fun and lobby is busy at night. There are beds to lie on, swings, comfy chairs etc. Just a fun scene.Language-learn a little spanish-just the basics are appreciated.Tip-it helps a great deal. Staff works hard and were so nice to our kids. Time Share-didn't get approached once.Mostly I'd say smile, relax, take things in stride. It's not home-no one is an rush. Do your research and know what to expect. Don't sweat the small stuff. Reserve was awesome. Hope you have a great time--we did!!

<Content>Wonderful Family Christmas Vacation Trip Our entire family stayed at the Paradisus resort for 6 days over the Christmas Holiday week. We stayed in the Reserve Family Conciege and were very pleased with the accomodations, food and overall service. The Kids Club was perfect for our 3 girls ages 2, 7 and 11 and allowed us some time to ourselves while the girls went Horseback riding, played games and swam in the Kids Pool. Our concierge Silvio was very helpful with setting dinner reservations, helping with activities for the children and keeping us up with activities around the resort. The kids were truly pampered with robes, backpacks, t-shrits and stuffed animals for Christmas presents. The resort was beautifully kept with amazing plants and vegatation. If you are going expecting American Food, you will be disappointed. Not to say that there wasn't burgers, fries and pankcakes but the resort definitely presents traditional Dominican Food along with traditional American and other countries food dishes. If you like trying different types of food you will pleased although 6 days of eating at buffets was more than enough. We had special reservations at the Reserve for Christmas Eve dinner at a seafood buffet which was the best seafood I have ever had. My husband and I were very pleased and the Kids Club had a special Christmas dinner for the kids in their own restaurant with food just for children. The rooms at the Reserve were very nice. I am very picky as I travel a lot on business and have stayed at some very nice hotels. We had the One Bedroom Family Conceirge Suite which was very nice although not perfect but pretty close. Our biggest complaint was the noise in the hallways from the slamming doors as visitors left their rooms in the mornings. Unless you are a hard sleeper don't expect to be able to sleep in with the noise in the mornings. Also, any type of room service and special request (i.e pillows) took forever, so you definitely need some patience.I would recommend paying the extra to stay at the Reserve. It seems like you get a whole different level of service and accomodations.

<Content>"Families Beware" Truthfully we don't know where to begin! All we have to say is that if you're traveling with an infant  younger children this wouldn't be the place to stay. What didn't go wrong during our family stay at this resort.. Check - In was a nightmare, our room was smokey, smelly  disgusting (not good when you have a 11 month old baby  a 10 year old child). The resort was so huge that they had portable trains to transport everyone from one end of the resort to the other which is a good thing BUT (yes! there is a BUT) they were constantly braking down  on a hot  humid day this is not good especially when your dealing with an infant! This resort is not cut out for families with specific needs meaning reasonable walking distance to all the resturants, shops, spa's, pools  entertainment/show areas (believe us when we tell you this was not the case). If these needs are important to you  your loved ones don't stay here! Go somewhere more accomodating to your needs. All we have to say We will never return to this resort or any other resort that is affliated with Sol Melia. F.Y.I.: The only Plus to this resort is if you are a club member MEANING you have ROYAL SERVICE Membership maybe just maybe it would be a pleasurable stay for all of you  your loved ones! BUT if your not a vacation club member you can just forget about it!

<Content>Paradisus is ranked 27th for a reason! A four-star resort? Are you serious? After spending the week of Christmas with our entire extended family at the Paradisus, we found the resort grounds beautiful and well manicured, and we found the staff to be friendly, if a bit slow. Check-in was truly painful and slow, taking well over an hour even though everything had been prepaid. We're fairly patient people, but it was unreasonablly unorganized considered we had been scheduled months in advance. One thing that cannot be overstated is the extremely low quality of much of the food. I'll try to be more specific than some of the other reviews. The Hybiscus was extremely disappointing the first evening. True, it's a buffet. But 100% of the dishes were not being heated in the steam trays. We're talking about fish, shrimp, and meat that have been left at room temperature for hours,....Breakfast was slightly better. Again, everything on the buffet was cold: eggs, sausage, undercooked bacon,.....There was a made-to-oder omelet station which was good if you didn't mind waiting in line.Every order of fish or seafood our party had over the course of the entire week, regardless of restaurant or time of day, was cold, old or undercooked. Every time. I truly wonder how many cases of food poisening are encountered here each week. I'm not complaining about flavor or taste issues here. This lack of quality control will kill people. Other restaurants we found to have the same issues with quality control. Even for individual orders (not buffet), they appear to make everything well ahead of time and just wheel it out when ordered without reheating. The steak house had some of the poorest quality cuts of steak I've encountered. I'm not being unkind here: Very stringy and tough T-bones with more than 60% fat instead of meat. Other cuts our party ordered were of equally low quality with the expection of the tenderloin which was good.We had a special anniversary meal planned the the Japanese restaurant, which required reservations. Of course, the reservation was recorded for the wrong evening and # of people, so we did not get to celebrate the special day as a family, or on the right day.Beware of checkout: The maids reported that one room in our party had hidden a guest in their room, so they charged us for an extra person. Of course, this wasn't true. They would not provide info on how they came to this conclusion - only that the maid said so,...After hours spent making no headway with the front desk, and no management willing to get involved, our party was late to the airport. After surviving the inedible food for a week, and spending thousands of dollars for our family to stay at a resort ranked # 27, to accuse my family of thievery over a few hundred dollars was more than I'm willing to take. We won't be back period. So much for Christmas at the Paradisus. That is our last business with Sol Melia, and good riddance. There are far too many quality resorts that aren't trying to kill and steal from their guests!

<Content>Beautiful setting/pool/beach but mediocre food The Paradisus Punta Cana is a beautiful, expansive resort with magnificent landscaping. As many reviewers have said, the beach is lovely, with soft sugary sand and clear clean water. What an improvement over the many Caribbean resorts with beaches covered in seaweed, rocks and debris! The lagoon pool is huge and delightful, with perfect water temperature and plenty of shade umbrellas on the perimeter. Our room was pleasant and comfortable but average overall. I've stayed in much nicer rooms and the age of the construction is beginning to show. On the negative side, the big issue was the food. The French, Chinese, Japanese and Mediterranean restaurants were good enough, with the best choices in the beef and shrimp category. However, the buffet food was dreadful. Unless you have an appetite for gelatinous mystery meat and mayonnaise salads, greasy tureens of seafood and overripe fruit, the buffet will be a total turn-off. Even the desserts were weird (an unidentifiable mixture of 3rd world Cool Whip and food coloring). The non-reservation restaurants (Brazilian, Terra steakhouse) were chaotically managed and they relied a lot on the buffet food we were trying to avoid. The Paradisus resorts in Riviera Maya, Mexico and in Puerto Rico had far superior food.In all other respects we found the service to be fine.

<Content>Fantastic Resort for Families We found this resort a perfect place for familes. We have a 1.5 year old and were surprised to find so many ammenities for us. I would recommend this resort without any reservation for families like ours. The web site does not advertise the kid friendly aspects which were important to us. We stayed at the Reserve- gorgeous and swanky. Beautiful, impeccably maintained grounds throughout entire resort. Our room was fantastic, separate room for child, eating area, comfortable deck, huge jacuzzi- which is great post-beach. 2 flat scren tvs and dvd player in bedroom. They stocked our mini bar constantly with our favorites and we enjoyed the 24 hour room serveice regularly for fresh milk, whatever. Room service food not great for meals but for simple child friendly food/snacks great. KidZone: beautiful facility: much larger than web site shows with huge outdorr play area, the staff also takes them swimming and on activities like face painting. They have nice nursery for naps, and are open until 10:00pm so parents can go out to dinner/show/etc. We had babysitter come to our room every night (Elizabeth/Dulce), lovely women and we were able to arrange last minute with concierge. Kids pool awesome: four fun waterslides that were appropriate for 1.5 year old and older kids. Large baby pool. Staff gave us bag of beach/pool toys when we asked. The kids pool also had awesome private family cabanas that we all chilled out in. Service great: constantly taking orders. Grill open close by for lunch/snack. Picture five families hanging out in own cabana, adults drinking/talking with each other, kids playing together: dreamy.The Reserve section is gorgeous. New and swanky; Ian Schrager/W Hotels style. Much more beautiful resort than web site shows. We have been at top hotels around world and found this compared well. The grounds and facilities definitely. Although the staff is generally lovely, their first language is definitely Spanish and there can be things lost in translation. As we were warned, beware of time share sellers posing as Concierges. They don't work for resort, just there to solicit people for pitches. They are aggressive, as they make $50 per family in a poor country. You have to be aggressive too. We were nice for a few days, gently blowing him off, then I tired of him pressuring us and told him sternly No and that I did not want him asking us again. He did get the message and left us alone after that. He and the other concierges ended up being helpful making reservations, getting babysitters, having things replaced/fixed, etc.Restaurants, better than can be expected for all inclusive. We like the new Latin restaurant Fuego, and found Italiano delicious for yummy pizzas and pastas. El Romantico despite the corny name had an excellent steak and lamb chops. We found Vento's menu intersting and creative and the setting beautiful, but the food was pretty rich and heavy for our tastes. We found Chinese decent and were shocked at the Japanese restaurant being good. We had low expectations as we eat sushi/Japanese regularly, but even the sushi appetizer was decent. Don't order tepanaki fish- do steak or chicken. Gabi grill had gorgeous and huge breakfast buffet.Bars had large selection of top shelf and we found drinks very well made and strong.Re: service. We were there the week before Christmas before the rush, we found service outstanding; however resort probably overstaffed for influx of guests the following week. We also tipped well and I think word gets around. By giving a few bucks, you can be assured a prompt delivery and constant service. Our maid was great and cleaned our large messy room well and stocked our pantry daily.Beach beautiful. Private Reserve section real plus. GREAT beach service and better palapas than main beach- big adjustable beach beds. We found getting around to beach and main resort easy by train, staff would call for us or we'd just wait for the next train. No problem.

<Content>Liked the Paradisus Punta Cana My husband and I divided our vacation to the Dominican Republic b/t the Paradisus Punta Cana for the first four days and the Paradisus Palma Real for the last five (see our review over there- we preferred the Palma Real greatly). We had a nice check in/ welcome drink and were taken to our room- we had a RS Ocean View room though we chose not to do RS. This was great, but WAY far from the main building. Our concierge was HORRIBLE, as was the whole foraging for dinner that took place. Nothing was ever available and for the first two nights we had to settle for room service in our room. Our concierge claimed he would take care of everything for our dinner reservations, not to worry- thank God we sensed he was a flake and we fought for our own reservations- of course found out that he hadn't done any of the reservations as we feared. If you choose to put faith in your concierge- get your dinner reservation IN WRITING. Our vacation took a turn for the better when we discovered the Gabi area. We paid for using that pool for the day and got our massages up there/ ate lunch. SO much nicer than the actual resort- which I would call 'fine'. The pool is nice, not luxurious. The beach was beautiful but there was a sandstorm when we were there, and when that was over it just wasn't very convenient to move from the beach to the pool. We spent a lot of time walking around and that's just not relaxing. Our last two dinners were at Vento and that was something outstanding at the resort. It's less expensive than the Palma Real and I'm happy we went to this one first or it really would have been a letdown. I would pay the extra money and go there.

<Content>Paradisus Punta Cana Amazing for Some This resort, like most all inclusive resort, has different levels of service, room and restaurants in accordance to your room rate. We stayed in the Reserve area of the resort and it was amazing and worth the additional cost. The design of this area of the resort is very Euro-trendy and includes amazing food, private beaches and spa like atmosphere. The service and staff was great! The only issue was the language barrier. I was surprised the staff did not have a better understanding of English. We were able to visit friends at other resorts and the Paradisus Punta Cana , by far was the best resort we visited. If you are not able to stay in the Reserve area I would only give the resort an average rating. If you do stay in one of the upper end areas it is an excellent rating in all categories.You will need to check out resorts carefully in Puta Cana our experience was great, but most of the resorts are on the level of Daytona Beach, Florida. If you can not afford to go all out, save your money and stay closer to home.

<Content>Not what we expected, not worth the price. Pluses - nice beach with beautiful white sand, nicely decorated and trimmed property, the pool is great, with a swim-up bar. Dinners in restaurants are OK, the Mediterranean and French restaurants are very decentMinuses - personnel is trying to be friendly, but they are very sloppy. For example, there was the housekeeper's or previous guests' hair all over the floor in our suite. So, my wife had to do extra cleaning herself. Also, the personnel are not fluent in English.Buffet is open only for breakfast, poor choice of tasteless food. Lunch in the restaurant by the beach is not bad, but same dishes every day. One day, my wife found a rubber band in her food at this restaurant! The main reason we chose this hotel was the all-inclusive activities, such as scuba diving. Howvever, because of the constant waves (and as we found out later, there are huge waves at this particular place of Punta Cana because of its location), I couldn't do any scuba diving. So, we had to book a separate trip to Catalina Island in the Caribbean sea (near La Romana), where I did scuba diving, and my family enjoyed snorkeling, both for extra charge, obviously. We did not feel safe at the beach, especially for our little daughter, because there are a lot of strangers there roaming around trying to sell you smth or sign you up for smth. The nightly entertainment shows are very poor and of low quality.We also had problems with our keys, twice. When we tried using them to open the door to our room, they did not work. And mind it - because of the huge hotel territory, it takes you 15 minutes to get to the lobby to fix them.Another thing - there is no alcohol in your room's bar, and the choice of alcoholic beverages on the hotel's property is very poor. One more thing - they are trying to promote the Reserve area of this hotel by booking you on a 90-minute tour (which in reality took three hours), with the purpose of making you sign up for some kind of a timeshare. Our concierge said that if we attend the tour, we will get a one week of free stay at the Reserve, valid for the next two years. So, we attended this three hour tour and totally wasted our time, and the people were puttting a lot of pressure on us trying to make us sign up for this program. We refused at the end, and guess what? They did not offer us any free stay at the Reserve! (And the concierge later said that they recently discontinued doing so). So, we really very much regretted wasting our precious vacation time on this.Here is our advice - stay away from this particular place, it is not worth your money, it is such a dissapointment. If you are planning a trip to the Dominican Republic, choose a hotel at the Caribbean coast. We decided for ourselves that Riviera Maya in Mexico is much-much better and costs less.

<Content>An Amazing Resort Just returned yesterday from a six night stay at the Paradisus. I was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful, friendly and helpful everyone was. The entire staff helped to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The hotel was not at full capacity so we did not have any problems getting lounges or reservations at any restaurant we chose.The beach is spectacular, soft beautiful sand and emerald water. The waves were a little rough and it was a bit windy so water sports were not always available. The restaurants were all good with very attentive service.I particularly liked Fuego. It had a very New York cosmopolitan feel and my husband and I tried several appetizers, two entres and a few deserts that night. The waiters brought whatever you wanted without a problem. Wine was poured frequently at every restaurant without asking.The house wine varied from restaurant to restaurant but was pretty good.I also liked the Gaby Restaurant at the Reserve. Food and service both A+. Breakfast buffet offered good choices and even the Dominican coffee was pretty good.Lunch buffet was located on the beach, pretty similar each day but it didnt matter as the view was amazing.At night there was a show off the lobby which had the same team perform every night. They were a pretty talented bunch. After a while, they felt like friends. Following each show, the lobby was full of music and dancing. A lot of fun and very lively.We didnt go into the disco as we danced at the lobby bar til midnight along with the dancers from the hotel which were very entertaining and a lot of fun.We sat in on the Reserve Vacation Club 90 minute sales pitch one morning as we wanted to see it. Very beautiful but very quiet and a little far from the beach and main pool. All in all, we had a wonderful trip. The resort felt rather large when we arrived, but by the time we left, it felt extremely comfortable. I would recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for a hotel with attentive staff, beautifully breathtaking scenery and good food and drinks. (I think that is everyone)

<Content>Fabulous time My husband  2 kids (ages 12  15) just returned from 5 days here. My brother  his fiance were married while we were there - between the two families there were 29 people there.I'll have to admit i was nervous after reading some of the reviews but we have no complaints at all. The resort is beautiful, the staff is friendly  we had fantastic service. There were quite a few people who didn't speak English so you definitely should brush up on key Spanish phrases before going. We found the staff liked teaching us how to say Spanish words.I did not have 1 single person approach me about buying a time share. My husband didn't either.We hung out on the beach for a couple of hours each day  then would hit the pool for the rest of the day. The poolside bar along with the various poolside activities were a blast!The restaurants were not 5-star quality but everything was very good and there was a tremendous selection of everything.My husband played golf one day  said the course was in great shape  transportation there was easy.The wedding was held in the gazebo on the beach, everything was great. The pictures  videographer did a fantastic job as well.All in all, it was a fantastic vacation. We would definitely recommend to friends  family.

<Content>GREAT all-inclusive resort!!! My husband and I got married at the private beach on the resort. We had family and friends come out with us. This was our first time in the Dominican. The check-in process was long but after a drink (which they serve you as soon as you walk up to the reservation desk) all was good. We stayed at the Reserve..EXCELLENT choice! Our maid was awesome. The hotel gave us turn down service nightly and took very good care of us. They cleaned our room twice a day. The food was ok. We actually got sick the first night but that was our fault for eating medium rare hamburgers. Not a good idea. My husband and I stuck to the seafood, rice and breads the rest of our trip. But overall, the service was wonderful. The beach location is great. I totally recommend doing some excursions (like swimming with the sharks) off the resort. Either way, we love this place and would like to come back for our anniversary next year.

<Content>A 2 star dump for a 5 star price We went to Paradisus Punta Cana to celebrate our anniversary. My travel agent had been there previously and highly recommended it as a 5 star luxury resort. We upgraded our stay to Royal Service so we could take advantage of the bigger room, better service and adults only pool. What a waste of time and money. When we arrived they did not have our reservation. After 3 tours of the resort they finally found us a room. The room had a bed, desk, and 2 chairs - not what I would call a suite but that was they only size room offered in Royal Service. We were too tired from traveling to notice much and simply went to bed the first night. When we woke up the next day we noticed the blood stains on the sheets, the cigarette holes in the shower curtain, the strange orange stains all over the tile floor, and the bugs crawling all over the desk. On our first full day we were assaulted by our butler with offers of massages, room upgrades, and special dinners. He took us to show us the rooms we could upgrade to and then asked us to join the Sol Melia vacation club. When we refused to join the club the butler disappeared and our Royal Service dried up. When we asked for rides to the lobby with our golf clubs they never sent anyone. When we asked for dinner reservations we were told the restaurants were full or closed. When we called Royal Service to ask to have our toilet fixed, our safe fixed and our sliding glass door fixed we were told it was not their job and they did not offer to contact the right person to take care of it. The Royal Service staff was rude and refused to help us make golf reservations at certain courses even though the courses were on a list of courses that they provided to us. When I asked to speak to a manager I was directed to the public relations desk and the gentleman there was not interested in helping me. The food and drinks were just okay and the food was never served at the correct temperature. Also, every one of the 10 resort restaurants seems to think it is correct to servce red wine chilled and white wine warm. All of the alcoholic drinks were severely watered down as well. The best drink I had during my stay was a beer I bought at a bar down the street from the resort because it was cold. I could go on but you get the idea - if you want to go to the Domincan pick another resort!

<Content>Better than Ever This was my second time staying at the Paradisus Punta Cana and I was amazed at all the great improvements they have made over the last year (and that is saying alot because it was already pretty spectacular). We stayed as part of the Royal Service promotion that Sol Melia (the owners) run every November where you get a free upgrade to Royal Service. You need to be a member of Club Melia to get emailed about this promotion. The Royal Service is so worth it to us if just for the private pool and breakfast lounge alone. Throw in beach side service in your own private area of the beach and you can see why it is worthwhile to upgrade. Since last year, they have added a new area called the Reserve. I think it is part of their time share plan but as a member of Royal Service you get access to the two fantastic restaurants there. The food is superb and a step above what is available in the rest of the resort albeit the rest of the food isn't too bad at all. We had 5 perfect days of weather and 5 overcast windy days. A few tips to travellers...it is all-inclusive so order your drinks with premium spirits or you will get well drinks. Make your food reservations in advance or when you first get there as not all restaurants are open all the time and some places fill up fast. If you are like us, you want to try as many as possible and then go pack to your favorites again. Golf tee times are only available one day in advance from the hotel unless you go on line and pay a $10 surcharge per person. If you really want to play golf, you should book in advance. If you decide you want to play the next day then book early the day before. Some tips for golf...you get picked up first and then the bus goes to other properties...sit in the front seat so you can get to the pro shop check-in first or you will be in a long line with your other bus mates. Don't worry about your clubs...they will be downstairs waiting for you. It is the DR so a few $$$ and being ready to go will get you on the course first regardless of tee times. The bus returns on the hour from the course so you may want to cut that last hole short unless you want to wait at the course for the next one and waste all that valuable beach time. Every year I bring a couple of hundred in ones. The staff really appreciates the tips and you get great service....you won't miss a couple of hundred so live life large.Do not do the timeshare presentation unless you are really committed. ENJOY!

<Content>Perfect for a relaxing honeymoon We went to Paradisus for our honeymoon in June 2008 which is the off-season for them. This was fortunate for us as the customer service was slow at times so i can only imagine how overwhelmed they must be in the peak season. That being said everyone at the hotel was incredibly friendly which made up for the occassional tardiness. We went with the royal service. The best part about this feature was the private pool with no kids and never a long wait at the swim up bar. We also had our own section of the beach which included waitstaff to get us food and drinks and again... no kids. Those were the two major differences we saw between the two options though royal service guests are suppose to have other extra perks I cant rememebr what they were. Until I stay there without the royal service I wont comment on weather or not it was worth it. The beach was awsome, the water was perfect, and it was never crowded. The restaurants were all pretty good and featured enough of a variety to keep dinner from being monotonous. Food started going though me pretty quick after the fourth day but other than that neither my wife or I felt any negative effects from the food and water. If you decide to visit this hotel, here is some advice. Make sure you meet the guy for the excursions the day after your arrive, they can be trusted as both the excussions he recomended to us were great. Make sure you look at the restaurant schedule and plan out you week's dining as soon as you get there. Certain restaraunts are only open once or twice a week. If you go shopping outside the resort, everything is over priced by 100% so make sure you haggle and if you want liquor or cigars, ask your bartender to pick them up for you as they can get them for much cheaper. Also haggle witht the salesment on the beach for watersports. One last thing, DO NOT TIP!!! A couple we met there started tipping everyone and staff came to expect it and became disgruntled or pestery when they didnt recieve one. We only tipped out waiter on the beach and our bartender. All and all we were very pleased with our stay here.

<Content>Just what we needed! Read this and then just GO! I read all the reviews from every site about this hotel and frankly, that was a mistake. I mean it gave us some good tips, but we really needed to just review for ourselves. More importantly, we needed to get away. Just go and enjoy every little moment with R and R in mind. You must really enjoy the people you are with as you will spend a lot of time with them, but this was great with us. I will tell you this for 100% sure: the sandy beaches and the unbelievable four shades of blue waters were worth every dime. I've never seen anything like it. The waves are great to play in and there are no jelly fish or sharp rocks, not even big shells! Just soft, cool, white sand! My advice: (and then you decide for yourself) yes, take singles for tips (about 70 for a four night stay), get to all the restaurants, but be open minded for new and different, (Fuego was our favorite), stay along the beach (we had royal service) and stayed on the end right on the ocean. Only do the Reserve thing if the room is the most important part of your stay. Yes, it has bigger, newer rooms and it has a great jacuzzi, but it's further from the beach. They will try to do the timeshare thing, but they took no very graciously. (IF we ever buy a timeshare, it'd be here). Girls, bring your own personal items including conditioner; boys- bring a camera! There were several weddings while we were there over the Thanksgiving break and they were lovely, but beach walkers practically walked into the ceremony. (Some people have no manners.) Wedding planners- take a close look at music set up. The native men/ employees are beautiful and kind and totally spoil you! We still miss Juan! Ask for things you need, do it in a nice way and share some dollars! (We had wine, beer, pillows, special baths prepared, cheese and fruit plates) and DEFINITELY do the massage on the beach. You cannot beat the sound of waves while getting a couples massage at the top of the tower.  I wouldn't advise going out of the property- there's really no reason. The horseback riding was great fun, but they treat their horses horribly! They are not in very good shape and the workers assume all we want to do is run the whole time. You do have to go off the property to ride. Overall, after talking to other people about nearby resorts, we felt we got the best deal. It'd be nice not to have to worry about tipping and having the right cash around, but it was also worth it!

<Content>Thanksgiving in Punta Just got back feom 6 days including Thanksgiving. Wife and 13 year old Daughter. We are from DFW area. I am not a good typer (speller) (especially when I do a review) US air into Charlete then onto DR. I could, and probably will, do a whole piece on US air! Long story short; A real rude lady wouldn't let us check our bags in Dallas becasue we were 3 minutes inside their 45min. check in requirement. So, we had to take the next flight out which ended up meaning we got to DR without our luggage until the next day. US air is not so great! Go another if possible! We arrived DR afternoon and the aiorport was very nice. Weather was chilly and windy. All was pretty good thru airport. With exception, the tranfer bus, which was included in our package, was a long wait before we left. Thought about doing a taxi but found out it was about $45 one way. So we hung in there. The approx 30 minute drive wasn't bad. Lots of new construction, lots of poverty. It's one or the other. Pulled up in front of the resort. NICE entry! Long wait to get checked in. Kind of complicated and frustrated in check in becasue between dealing with check in people, a concierge came up, (very nice) and was leading us here and there? We just wanted to get to our room and get acclimated on our own. As it turned out, because I called ahead and requested a possible upgrade if possible. etc. etc. to Francisca Dela Rosa, assist. mgr., we were upgraded to the Reserve. In rerospect, if you know you are in the Reserve, asked to be dropped off at the front reception of the reserve and not the main hotel check in. Anyway, fianally, we got to our room. VERY NICE! The reserve is the newer part of the resort. A little more upscale. Our room had a seperate master and a pull out close to the sliding door to balcony overlooking an ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL POOL! What we determined in Retro is the reseve is a little more for adults and laid back types. We always graduated towards the beach everyday. So, if you want more laid back upscale etc., the Reserve is the place. Lots of Yanni type music, no entertainment per say, etc. If you want beach, activities, more fun, request something closer down by the beach. there is an incredible pool down by the beach also which we hung out at a lot. Having said that, at night, the place to be is at the main lobby area of the hotel (which is right next door to the reserve but a long way away from the beach area). They have trains which run most of the time all around the property. By train from the main lobby to the beach= approx. 10 minutes. Now, back to the reserve and where we were. Forget about the conciege in the main lobby. We hooked up with Silvio, a concerige, in the lobby of the Reserve, who was great! Good guy. I tipped him $20 from the get go. Mainly becasue we still hadn't received out bags and asked him to bird dog that situation. He did and got them to us the next day. Speaks perfect english. Sidepoint: Learn some basic spanish b4 you leave. It will help you. Beaches are beautiful. The accomindations at the beach are great. Lots of cool lounge chairs etc. One problem, no wait staff on the beach. Not far to go for drinks though. Los of fun on the beach. Volleyball, paddleball, watersports, etc, etc. Laid back. No sales people there. All good! Waves were strong. Fun for grown ups, wouldn't recommend fro young. I can not say enough for how well the greounds looked and are maintained! BEAUTIFUL!! One huge disappointement for me was there wasn't one bar with a TV there so I could watch theCowboys and American Football! Had to go to my room and watch the games (in spanish of course).  Room service was pretty good. Ask Silvio to keep beer in mini fridge. If you don't you won't have any. The food: This review is based on our all inclusive vacationing experience. Mainly numerous cruises we have gone on. Only a couple all inclusive resorts:On a 1 to 10: 6.5They have a ton of different restauraunts around the property. We ate all but one night at the reservation only restauraunbts which Silvio set up for us when we first got there. There are I think 7 of the reservation only resteraaunts. The first night, because we didn't have our bags yet, we ate at the non reservation seafood place down by the beach. YUKO! They had what I think was a lobster. YUKO! This plac is the main resteraunt during the day by the beack (buffet) fro lunch and it is good then. We ate during our stay at the Meterrainian restaurant, the Japanese, The French and the Latin. The latin was the best! Followed by the Medeterainian, the Japanese and the the french. Nice places all of them. the food was very good/ not reat (again based on all inclusice experience). The overall service: 1 to 10 = 10We had a good time every eveneing at the main lobby bar which is he center place for the eveneing entertainment. They have shows everynight which are fun. Not broadway mind ya, but fun. It is cool the after the shows the dancers come out and dance with us peoples and work on out latin moves! Pretty cool. Fun. Drinks: 10 Plus The only bummer was two things. 1) just Heiniken and Presedente beers. and 2) the wine that was inluded was OK. The white wine (bino blanco) was better thant the red. Other than that, they had great martitnis, frozen drinks, call liquors etc. No any activities for our 13 year old. Other than what we did on the beach etc. No organized activities. Still lots of fun!My Wife and Daughter did a Horse back ride set up thru the hotel. FREE!! Amazingly, this is FREE! Poor horses (skinny). They had a blast riding on the beach. It is not there at Paradisis however. As is none of the excursions. You have to load up and drive in buses or vans 15 - 20 miutes or so. I went golfing at Cocotal golf course. AMAZINGLY, this is frre too! Other than $35 for the cart. I brought my clubs but they have nice Calloway and Taylormade rentals. The course was very nice. Well maintained, and the greens were great! 27 holes. The Bougavilla 9 wasthe best! Pretty long. The only thing I would suggest (which I did on the way beck) is to just pay the $15 taxi to get to the olf instaed of the shuttle which takes forever and picks up from other resorts all golfers etc. OK, I'm getting worn out there. Hope this all helps some. Oh yea, b4 I sign off, we did the Segway Tour that the hotel offered. Not free but reasonable. FUN, BEAUTIFUL AND COOL! dO IT! Do thr 2 hour! You will have a blast! The casino sucked. Especially if you are a somewhat serious gambler. Small, and I found the service there kinda rude for soem reason. We spent maybe 10 minutes in there. Broke even playing black jack! Yea! Overall 1-10: We give it an 8! Especially for the $$ I think we paid a little less than $3800 for three of us including air. Not bad! One last thing. the trip back from DR was thru Philidelphia. What a long trip that was! We got the last three sears in the plane next to the bathrooms! Terrible! Adios!

<Content>Good experience,went for golf. Stayed in a regular junior suite. Room a little worn but clean and a great location (bldg 20) near beach, pool and restaurants. Breakfast was okay except for the omeletter maker who was slow as molasses and made only 1 at a time. Dinner was excellent at the special restaurants which required reservations ( Fuego, Vento  La Romantica. Check the schedule when you arrive and make your dinner reservations for the week as there are usually 4 or 5 open per nite. The seafood restaurant was horrible ( lobster tails that were overcooked and tasted like mush). The Brazilian was fair and had an odor as you walked in. Not much of a drinker but what I saw was impressive (all top shelf). Main purpose of the trip for my wife and me was the golf. The course (Cocotal) was very nice and in excellent shape. The shuttle to the course was inconvenient ( a normal 10 minute ride that would take 30 minutes with stops and ran once an hour). You can only book tee times 1 day ahead, so if you want a desired tee time early you can book ahead of time online for $10. pp. Because of the shuttle schedule we took a taxi several times ($20. inc. tip). The Paradisus Punta Real  Melia Tropicale are much closer to the golf. Went to the time share vacation club to get a certificate to reuturn for 6 nites room only. They don't understand the word no until I finally raised my voice in a crowded room. When you have to wait at the airport for your return fiight go to terminal 2 and wait. It's more comfortable, air conditioned and finally found real ice cream at Baskin Robbins.

<Content>A perfect vacation destination My family just returned from a luxurious week at Paradisus Punta Cana. Our party consistented of my parents (ages 66, 70), my husband and I (ages 41, 47), my sister, (age 38) and two children (ages 12 and 8.) The resort was gorgeous and the beach at this resort was the nicest one along the entire Bavara beach area. Every single person who worked at the resort went out of their way to make our vacation special. They truly embodied the idea of hospitality.The food was very good at the a la carte restaurants. They each offered unique choices, definitely on the fancier side. If you are looking for a plain piece of grilled chicken, this is not the resort for you. Each dish was beautifully presented. The only ones we did not try were El Romantico (French) and Sakuro (Japanese). Please note that collared shirts and long pants for men are required for dinner at most of the a la carte restaurants at this resort.Because of a connection one of us had in the hotel industry, we were upgraded to The Reserve section of Paradisus Punta Cana. The rooms in The Reserve were gorgeous and the private pool at The Reserve was unbelievable. There were wonderful beds built into the pool where you could cool off, but not have to go swimming. Some of the pool beds were in the shade under palapas so you could enjoy being in the water even if you wanted to escape from the sun. The staff in the Reserve section came around with icy cold washcloths for your face to keep you refreshed, and passed around fresh fruit skewers, even to those of us in the pool!The Reserve has its own restaurant called The Gabi. The breakfast buffets were outstanding, and the dinner at The Gabi was gourmet and delicious.The grill at The Reserve was our daily lunch destination. It had the best marinade for the grilled chicken. And my kids lived on the freshly made hotdogs, burgers and fries. We loved eating in the shade with our feet in the sand.The beaches were wide and had the softest sand. We traveled on the off-season, and never had a problem with finding a shady place under one of the enormous palapas on the beach. Each one could fit 15+ people!We enjoyed the snorkeling excursions and if you go, remember to bring bananas from the breakfast buffet with you to feed the fish. They love bananas!Currently, I am going into withdrawal because it is 3pm and I haven't had a pina colada yet. The ones at The Gabi bar on the beach and in the Lobby are the strongest, but there is something about drinking them while you're in the pool that screams relaxing vacation. Although the only rooms we experienced were in The Reserve section, I cannot say enough about the accomodations. I highly recommend The Reserve at Paradisus Punta Cana if you are looking to be pampered on your vacation. I would return in a heartbeat.

<Content>Very nice hotel, but could use some improvement It took me a while to find a hotel in DR and after many reviews; I finally picked Paradisus Punta Cana. I鈥檓 very picky with hotels and like things to be perfect. I鈥檝e been to a few all inclusive resorts in DR and Mexico so I know what these hotels are like. RESORT - First let me say that the hotel is BEAUTIFUL!!!! The lobby is very pretty and so are the grounds. The pool and beach are also very nice. We were there on the off season so there were very few people there. ROOMS - We were booked to stay in a regular room and but were able to get an upgrade to the Royal Service area (just the room though). The rooms however are not great at all. They鈥檙e VERY old and smelly and just not that nice to stay in, and this is the royal service room for which you pay an extra $150/night. This room was closer to the beach and pool but I鈥檇 rather walk a little then be in this type of a room. We quickly paid for an upgrade to the Reserve Area and that was a total bliss. The rooms are AMAZING and that entire area is just great. They have a separate lobby, breakfast bar with better selections and 2 own restaurants and a separate incredible pool. This is definitely the area to stay in if you go to Paradisus Punta Cana. The only negative side is that it鈥檚 far from the beach but they have golf carts that take you anywhere you need to go and we never had to wait more than a few minutes for it. Reserve also has a sectioned off area on the beach with Bali beds and comfy chairs so they can take you straight to that area. BEACH 鈥?The beach was very nice, white sand, blue water, but water was very rough so it was kind of hard to swim in it. We stayed at the beach because there was a nice breeze but went to the regular pool to swim. FOOD 鈥?The food is not the greatest, but I wasn鈥檛 expecting it to be because I know where I am. Stay away from any seafood. It was all pre-cooked and pre-frozen so it tasted horrible. The steakhouse and Brazilian were our favorite places. Italian is good for lunch and dinner, instead of lunch buffets, Fuego was good and Vento (at the Reserve) was also not bad. Also, don鈥檛 bother with the French, it was pretty horrible. ENTRAINMENT 鈥?there鈥檚 really not much to do at night. They鈥檙e shows are all about singing and dancing and after 2 night it got very boring. I definitely saw better shows in other all-inclusive resorts. There is a disco lounge but it was pretty empty all nights and very loud so we didn鈥檛 even bother with that. They do have a casino which can keep you occupied for some time and that鈥檚 what we did. OVERALL 鈥?pretty resort, great Reserve area, food could be improved and regular rooms are pretty bad.

<Content>Okay experience, but won't be going back. The first part of the week we stayed in The Reserve after it had just opened. Stayed in a one bedroom suite with garden view. Hugh room, and it was beautifully furnished. Each section of The Reserve has it's own concierge and they all spoke English. Some spoke it better than others, but much better than the rest of the resort. The room service was pretty good, but inconsistent. Even though all the rooms have A/C it was still very humid in the room. The private pool was absolutely beautiful, with a swim up bar. The wait staff was very attentive. The drinks were okay, but I think they were watered down. The biggest disappointment was the food. They advertise throughout their website that they offer a world cuisine experience, but frankly it was awful. The second part of the week we stayed in the resort and stayed in the junior suite with garden view. What a horrible mistake. It was like going from the Ritz to Motel 8. You get what you pay for. The toilet leaked, and overall the room was very, very tired. And it smelled very musty. To this day (9 months later), some of my workout clothes still have that smell. Also, I don't think there's enough to do at this resort. I didn't venture outside of the resort as I didn't feel it was safe. So if you like to drink all day and lay in the sun, this is the place for you. If you're still interested in going to this resort, don't waste your money on the suites at the resort, but stay within the resort at The Reserve. It's a much better value.

<Content>2nd time good as the 1st We had such a good time in July went back in October to hide from the troubles of the rat race and election race. The atmosphere and experiance was just what the doctor ordered Rest and Relaxation. The food was great, service was excellent, and ambiance of location was just what we remebered. We risked possible bad weather but was pleasently surprised. We asked about hurricane season and they referenced one from 10 years ago. We were told Paradisus has not been hit since then! A very special place. We had maybe 4-30 minute bands of rain over a six night period and they were in the middle of the night. Just enough to keep it tropical. We will be back again because we are addicted to Paradisus. You get more than you pay for but if you want something for nothing go somewhere else! You know your in the right place when you land at a 100,000 square foot Tiki Hut Airport. Dimensions just a guess.

<Content>Paradisus Review I had previously reviewed the Paradisus Punta Cana and was critical of my stay there. I am not going to review the resort again. However I observed that any negative reviews are ALWAYS marked as not helpful (go back and see for yourself). I can only assume the resort is trying to unfairly denounce negative reviews. This is part of the problem with this resort - instead of trying to listen to constructive critism and make improvements, they would rather make anyone writing a negative review look like it is either poorly written or does not give very good information. Makes you wonder. For this reason, I do not see any improvements being made to the resort.

<Content>Royal Service Needs NEW Staff Royal Service WORSTS:- ALL ROYAL SERVICE STAFF (EXCLUDING the workers at the royal service poolside bar and the waiters at the royal service restaurant)it is as if they want a tip for EVERTHING (even for something that is included in the package). everything seemed to be about more money with them and their 'friendly' atmosphere was EXTREMELY fake. they ironed my swimsuit, RUINED IT! (ofcourse! WHO irons swimsuits???????), put it back as if NOTHING was wrong, made me call me SEVERAL times, and had the nerve to charge me at the end for the service which is included in what I was paying for???????!!!!! ALL the workers speak English VERY VERY well BUT when they get the feeling that a guest is not happy with something they ALL OF A SUDDEN forget how to speak English! useful for them but SO annoying for guests. - Cleanliness of rooms NOT present. Royal Service GREATS:- awsome view of the beach- sectioned off beach chairs, always with THE view of the ocean - quiet royal pool with lots of bali beds to go around- excellent bartenders always asking if I need something else- royal service food in the morning and lunch- golf reservations, pickupsParadisus Punta Cana GREATS:- ALL Restaurants- The WHOLE resort is Beautiful

<Content>Fine Hotel, Superb Service The Paradisus Punta Cana deserves its reputation as one of the top hotels of Punta Cana and the Dominican Republic.We stayed at The Reserve, a relatively new addition to the hotel, in a Family Concierge Suite.Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and assigned a concierge to take care of our every need. We were surprised to be given a celphone with her number. She took care of our every need during our stay with a pleasant smile. We were impressed.The hotel itself is beautiful. The Reserve is a truly world class five star service hotel. The accommodations were luxurious and in very good taste. We enjoyed the large bathtub Jacuzzi which the attendant set up for us in a perfect bubble bath. My wife and I fit comfortably.The hotel is located in a five mile stretch of beach loaded with other hotels. The beach is beautiful and not that crowded, if you consider the hotel density in the area.The hotel has a complete gym which rivals our private gym back home and a fabulous SPA.The hotel grounds are extensive, and transportation is provided. The room includes a large umbrella for the inevitable evening showers.The food was varied, fresh, clean and tastefully presented. We were delighted with the Gaby Restaurant and their staff. We also enjoyed our lunches in La Palapa and had one dinner in the Italian restaurant, which we found delightful.The Kids loved the Kid Zone, and rightly so. I would call this hotel kid friendly, its a kids paradise short of Disney. The Kid Zone has amenities, fun activities, an Air Hockey table, Ping Pong table, foosball, Large Screen Digital TV, eight Play Station terminals and a slew of board games. All topped off with attentive service from a committed staff. They were quick to earn my kids esteem. We felt like we were on a honeymoon with the kids counting the minutes until they opened every morning. Bringing all to mind, we were delighted with our stay and would gladly recommend it to our family and friends.

<Content>Improve the Food and you could have a 5 Star Stayed on the Reserve side. There are 2 sides to this resort, the less expensive, which is older side, but closer to the beach and more restaurants. And then there is the Reserve, which is their brand new luxury suites that just recently opened. The decor is gorgeous, Punta Cana beach is stellar on a sunny day. On the reserve side it is a bit of a walk to get to the beach, or you have to wait for a tram if you do not want to walk. The food definitely needs to be improved and the service is hit or miss. Improve the food and service and this could be a 5 star All inclusive resort experience.

<Content>The Good  We were at the Paradisus Punta Cana in September 2008 with a relatively large group. This was my first time to the Dominican but not my first experience with Paradisus. We all stayed in The Reserve area of the resort. The resort itself is beautiful and HUGE! If we walked to the beach from our room in The Reserve it was about a 15 minute walk. We usually took the shuttle but you always had to wait up to 30 minutes for the shuttle. I LOVED the pool  the Bali Beds at The Reserve  our room. We had a 1 Bedroom Suite, it was like a condo. However my view was of the back of the Convention area with all the a/c units. For the price paid for The Reserve that is really unacceptable. So, needless to say we did not spend any time on the balcony. The rooms need a phone list. We had no idea how to call concierge, room service, front desk, no one.It rained for the first 3 days and the resort did a great job of accommodating us since most of our planned events were supposed to be outside. The bad part is since all the buildings (including the stairwell of our room building) are open air, the floor had puddles of water everywhere, even the stairs. Several of us slipped on the tile floor and fell - I have a huge bruise on my backside from landing on the step. A couple from the group actually fell down the stairs. This is a major and dangerous issue that needs to be address. Also, since it rained so much we needed a schedule of activities going on. The ones we did find we just happened to walk up on. Language barrier not that bad, I know a very little spanish. Just remember you are in THEIR country they should not be expected to speak English. Always found a way to communicate.The bartenders were always great! The best personalities on the property - along with the entertainment/dance crew. We had a Salsa lesson which was really fun. Our housekeeper was very good also, friendly. The rest of the staff that we encountered was hit and miss. We were ignored in the restaurants. Concierge never 'wanted' to help, it seemed like it was an inconvenience. Noone seemed not to know anything beyond their particular job. The staff should really be educated on what the resort has to offer. The restaurants....food was bland, limited menus and yes, all the restaurants are NOT open every night. Only 3-4 a night. Which really was not an issue EXCEPT they did not give you a list of what was open when. You had to see the concierge person that was just full of personality every day to figure out where you could eat - this was frustrating. The Italian was the best. The Japanese was horrible and mostly inedible. The buffetts were ok as far as buffett's go. Not impressed with the food at all. I really expected more.The beach - beautiful, beautiful, beautiful We did the horseback riding that was included. They will tell you it is about a 10 minute ride to the 'ranch' except what they do not tell you is that you will spend 30 min - 1 hour picking up people at other resorts. The guides were really nice and helpful to those that needed it. The horses looked like they were undernurished , bones sticking out. I felt really bad for them. It was about a 5-10 min horseback ride down the street to the beach and then about 30 - 40 min on the beach. The water is breathtaking! There was new construction all down the beach and I guess with all the rain/hurricanes it had washed debri down the beach. We also did the ATV tour. It is not in the jungle as the description says. They take you to a large beautiful ranch and the guides take you down the dirt road and paved road to the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen! Pretty much secluded other than the peopl on the ATV tour and the few locals selling their crafts. We then went back down the dirt road to a cave with a fresh water 'pond'. It was pretty cool to see but way to dark in there for me to swim around. Many people jumped in. There was also a bar with drinks and snacks along with 8-10 vendors selling their jewelry, cigars, etc. I did get a really good deal on some cigars vs. the resort. All in all we enjoyed the day but would not spend $85 to do it again. Our guide was knowledgable and fun.The beaches, water and the countryside was absolutely beautiful, however, there was garbage everywhere, yes, household garbage. At some points there were bags of it just thrown on the side of the road.I have to say for the money, I was very disappointed. I expected more from a resort of that calibur. I can definitely see how the Dominican is in the top 10 for their beaches, what I cannot understand is why they do not clean the garbage off the roads. The roads themselves are bad enough without the garbage.Would probably go back the the DR is the price was right but would not go back to Paradisus Punta Cana.

<Content>Repeat customer! We have stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana for the last 8 years and will be returning again this coming March 09. If you love a beautiful beach, this is a destination for you. Juan, at the tennis facility, is excellent as a hitting partner. The four of us including Jose and Samuel have had a great doubles match as well. Although the courts could use some extra clay, they do a decent job of keeping them in the best shape that they can, given what they have to work with. There is always nice cold water to drink as well. They have undergone some major renovations in the past two years and it has served them well. It is not a new hotel, but it is kept up very well. The rooms could continue to use some updating, but we rarely are in the rooms, it's the grounds and beach we go for. The grounds and beach deserve the 5 stars. The employees are awesome. Almost everyone goes out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable.

<Content>Great Vacation, Perhaps A Little Mediocre... I am going to preface my review by explaining my background - I had worked 3 years as a travel agent, I worked 9 years for a major airline (my family has traveled extensively due to the perks of the airline business) and before that I worked 4 years in the hotel industry. I traveled to the DR with my family which included my husband who is a VP for a group of hotels in the Northeast states which are affiliated with 2 major and reputable brands. He is a 30+ year hotel veteran and my son started his career in the hotel business just 4 years ago. I think this makes us pretty qualified to give our brutally honest opinions of the Paradisus Punta Cana. I was cautious about the reviews I saw here but trusted my travel agent who is my old boss and good friend. I kept an open mind and expected things might not be perfect while reminding myself that this was a vacation and it was all about enjoying family and relaxing. My one major regret is that given the choice we decided against upgrading to a better room category. Our style would have been more the Reserve with the Royal service. However, the extra $2,000-2,500 saved was equivalent to my plans for a mini bathroom remodeling project I had in mind upon returning home from vacation. The trade off was for an investment, an everyday upgrade which I will enjoy for longer than just time spent one week on vacation in an upgraded hotel room. Actually, the room did not feel as dated as how others have described, but it was worn out and maybe in need of a face lift. It was indeed spacious and clean. The A/C functioned well. We did not have cafe doors to the bathroom but we did have a door with a glass panel upper half which gave no privacy. It took me until day 2 to discover a remedy - I hung a large bath towel over the top of the door and let it drape down over the window like a curtain. Viola! We stayed in bungalow 27 which was close to most of the restaurants, the beach and the main pool. The trade off for not upgrading at this resort is the ideal location of the inferior rooms. The beach was beautiful. White sand and aqua waters. Very clean and plenty of shade. There were many beach activities. But, this does not interfere with being able to relax. We had an 18 month old with us so we found sitting at the pool was a much better experience than dealing with the sand and baby. It was not high season so the hotel was only running a 50% occupancy rate. Therefore, plenty of chairs at the pool and beach when we finished breakfast each morning around 10:30 -11am. There were 5 adults - my husband, myself, 3 - 20 somethings and the baby. The 20 somethings could have probably used a little more nightlife. But, they certainly enjoyed the swim-up bar! The drinks were plentiful and served to perfection. There are only 2 kinds of beer Heineken and El Presidente. The wine is not so good. Our favorite restaurants were Vento, Fuego, Sakura and Romanitico. We ate at the steak restaurant the first night, the buffet the second night and had reservations all the other nights (which we made at the beginning of our stay). Buffets were mediocre but the food was plentiful. Buffet breakfasts and lunches get pretty boring every day. We would have loved to be able to order ala carte instead. However, the Italian restaurant offers ala carte but you cannot wear beach cover-ups and must go back to your room to dress for lunch. We used the fitness center and found it to be clean and well equipped. We took in one spa service - a couples massage which was wonderful. We speak little Spanish but never found the communication barrier too be much of a problem. The staff tries to understand and there is enough English speaking employees who come to the rescue. We did find some employees were more eager than others to provide quality service. Not that any of them were rude, but some were more focused on other duties and technical aspects of their jobs than tending to our needs. The most annoying situation was at breakfast when we almost had to plead for refills on our coffee. There were no insects. Maybe that's because we traveled there armed with repellent which we never needed. But, do bring SPF250! The sun is hot, hot, hot and the risk for sunburn is very high. Other things I wish I knew before going. The tile floors in the bedrooms and baths are very slippery when wet and the stairs leading down to the living area are dangerous for toddlers or anybody who might have too much to drink. The hotel does not provide hair conditioner and the humidity does a number on your hair without it. The DR is UGLY and scary. We stayed on the resort and never ventured out except on a horseback riding trip and ATV tour where we would get a good glimpse of poverty. By day 3 we felt imprisoned. We prefer to explore on our own when we are on vacation but this was an obviously unsafe place. The room they call a casino is a poor excuse for one - it's a joke! Perhaps the Princess might have been a better option and something we might very well consider if we ever go back to the DR. As far as all-inclusive resorts - this is not the best place we have stayed at but it's also not the worst. I would consider it mediocre. Again, we had the option of upgrading which might have made a world of difference but it's by choice we didn't and we'll just need to live with the fact that we got what we paid for. In regard to service, I'm a firm believer that respect is something that must be earned. We didn't go to the DR sporting NY attitudes. We went with carefree minds and decided to Not Worry and Be Happy! We set our expectations low to be pleasantly surprised. We also brought plenty of $1 and $5 bills and tipped with these small tokens - it wasn't necessary nor was it expected but in return we got great service. FYI - the average DR resort employee works 27 days a month for only $90. So, we felt good about tipping and even better about not being demanding hotel patrons, Arrogant Americans, Obnoxious New Yorkers. Then again, we know from experience that it's the well behaved hotel guests who earn the respect from a hotel staff. Our service was good because we were good to the staff and not demanding in any way. Would we go back? Probably not, but that's only because we prefer sampling a variety of destinations over a lifetime. Would I recommend the Paradisis - yes, but I would also suggest weighing your options.

<Content>Not luxury service Booked Paradisus Punta for nine nights in a row, expecting deluxe accommodations, service and food. Found none of the above. Room.- Stayed in the regular part of the resort (not The Reserve or Royal Service). Rooms need urgent renovation, time and use shows in the furniture. TV was not flat or widescreen. Mini bar did not work (staff changed it for another one, which did not work either). A/C was a little noisy. Bathroom was weared off. The room was clean, no bad odors; however not what you expect from a supposed to be a luxury resort.Food.- If you are looking for a high end meal you will not find it here, neither in the buffets nor in the reservation restaurants. Been in all the restaurants of the resort, probably Vento is the best of all (which does not mean we were fully satisfied with the meal or the service). Fuego was a beautiful location, however the fish was not fresh, it was pretty obvious it had been frozen several days before it was served. Same with the lobster of the Marino Restaurant. Japanese restaurant was below average, makis were absolutely disgraceful; tepanyaki was just ok, not any fancier than your local Benihana. Buffets were Ok, a bit repetitive though. Probably the best places to eat were the Italian restaurant (which needed no reservation), the pizza was quite good; and the chinese restaurant.In a nutshell if you are used to crisp vegetables, fresh seafood and innovative cuisine, go somewere else!Service.- Below average. Waiters are rude and not very attentive. It can take several minutes for one of them to approah your table with the menu and some more minutes to come back and ask for your drinks order, and so on. You might have to wait several minutes between your entree and the main dish. The same with drinks. Since the hotel is huge and there are many restaurants, tipping will not help because it is unlikely that the waiter will see you again, so no incentives for a proper service.Service at the bars (beach bar and lobby bar) was quite good. A couple of dollars will get you these guys pouring drinks all night long. I had to tell them to slow down a bit because my nightly amount of alcohol was being exceeded over and over. Liquors are ok, not really fancy. Black label scotch, absolut vodka, and VS cognac. No grey goose or twelve years scotch. Did not got anywhere near the pool bar, the same guys were there all day long drinking and laughing at the bar, never saw any of them go the bathroom!Bartenders at the lobby bar would set a party ambience before the nightly show. Pretty cool and entertaining.Beach.- Simply wonderful, postcard quality. White sand and turquoise water. Best beach ever. The resort has a section right next to the bar and the restaurant were where most people crowd. If you are looking for a place to meet people, party a bit, that is the place for you. However there is another area, right next to the club house, were it was quiet, fewer people just tanning and relaxing. Great for a beach lover who does not want to be disturbed!Vendors at the beach.- A bit pushy, specially if the see you have just arrived (they can tell because you are not tanned). They will offer parasailing, banana boat, cigars and local furniture. Crowd.- Since it is a spanish resort the european crowd is large, followed by americans and a few latinamericans. Topless is addmitted in the beach and in the resort. There is some, mostly at the beach.Heat.- Days are very hot. Be aware and take a sufficient amount of sun protection lotion for your whole vacation, you will need it. Some people go into the sea with shirts and baseball caps. There a convenience store but you will have to pay probably 50% more for sun protection lotion than in your hometown.Royal Service.- Someone told this guys it was a good idea to have two resorts in one, so you will see some areas of the resort reserved for Royal Service and unavailable for you if not in the Royal Service. In my opinion, it really sucks to book a luxury resort and find out that you do not have all the perks of the place. In my humble opinion it is a lousy marketing decision. Time Share.- They will try to set you up for tour in the new part of the resort. I refused to it right from the beggining and it stopped. It is a waste of time and it is time-share pitch no matter if they tell you otherwise. Overall the place is not bad, it is not a luxury resort though. Not sure if it is worth the extra dollar. Sorrounding resorts seem to be cheaper, most neighbors walking by the beach were amazed by the location and premises of Paradisus.

<Content>Treated Like Second Class Citizen My family and another family stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana in mid-August 2008 for one week. The resort itself is very beautiful; however, we were very unhappy with our stay. The major complaint we have is they SEGREGATE the Royal Service or Reserve people from the average person. Our friends stayed in the Reserve area because they could afford to which was fine with us. We had a bigger family and needed more rooms so did not want to go that route. We didn't think it would matter (its all within the resort - not separate). The problem was we were not allowed to go into the Reserve area to see our friends. We were told to leave. They segregate by placing different wrist bands on you. We paid for an ALL-INCLUSIVE resort!!! They, of course, had the beautiful swimming pool shown on their website. We had the crappy, hot water one. They had a grill right next to their pool, we had to change to eat lunch at a buffet (no swimsuits allowed). They had golf carts waiting to drive them wherever they wanted so they did not have to wait for the tram, which never seemed to arrive. We always ended up walking, and trust me we did ALOT of walking. They had private bars, a private section of the beach with nicer chairs/beds, they even went as far as handing out white umbrellas to them and red  white umbrellas to us when it rained. Now on to the little things, first they placed our two adult sons in a room with one queen size bed. We tried to get them into another room with two beds but they wouldn't; instead they sent a small cot for one of them to sleep on. Our toilet leaked and we wanted to be ungraded (which we offered to pay for) because we felt our room was too small for my husband, myself and two 11 yr olds. Forget it. no speaka de English. The language barrier was horrible. The rooms were freezing and we couldn't figure out the controls so we had to turn it off and then on again when it started getting humid, which didnt take long. Room service half the time never arrived; we called four times for an umbrella and never got one. Our travel director steered us away from the excursions the hotel offered (crappy he said) and told us to pay for the ones he had to offer, which unfortunately we fell for, only later to find out the hotel excursions were just as nice and most were FREE! If you can afford the Reserve and can speak Spanish, by all means go, it is a beautiful resort. But if you are average (we paid $1,800 per person to stay there, hmm $1,800 x 8 people; not cheap) and dont want to be treated like a second class citizen then go somewhere else. We may return to Dominican Rupublic again, but we will NEVER stay at the Paradisus again; we feel we paid too much money to be treated the way we were. One advantage of not staying in the Reserve - our pool bar rocked! - theirs was boring - ha! We second-class citizens know how to party.

<Content>Loved it. Would definitely recommend! (detailed review) We picked this resort based its beautiful beach, price and positive reviews from Frommers, Trip Advisor, our travel agent and a fellow co-worker. We stayed from July 28- August 5, 2008. It was our 1st anniversary. Were both Canadian from the greater Toronto area and have traveled to a few all-inclusives in the Caribbean. My wife is a 33 year old teacher and I'm a 39 year old firefighter. This website is an invaluable wealth of information so we want to reciprocate and share our experience. PRICE: Watched the prices for 3 months on websites selloffvacations.com and itravel2000 prior to booking. Paid $1178 CANADIAN plus taxes per person for a one week stay. We researched other hotels in Punta Cana including the RIU properties, Bahia Principe ($800 per person plus taxes) and Catalonia Bavaro ($700 per person plus taxes). Paradisus Palma Real received rave reviews but was easily $1000 more per person during the same week. Our tour operator was Signature Vacations. More on them at the end of my review.FLIGHT TO PUNTA CANA: (A) We stayed at the DoubleTree Toronto Airport the evening prior to our flight. Clean and comfortable hotel. This included a shuttle to the airport and parking for 8 days. $123 CANADIAN including taxes. Money well spent. No problems. Had breakfast at Perkins (a short walk down the street from the hotel).Prior to check-in at the DoubleTree we had a dinner reservation in the Distillery District at Pure Spirits Oyster House. Great location and atmosphere. Highly recommended. Bucket of champagne was at our table awaiting our arrival which was a surprise to us. Dinner was excellent. Check was picked up by my wife鈥檚 part-time summer employer. We were stunned. A great way to start our trip.Our flight was scheduled to depart at 4:30 PM. DoubleTree provides a complimentary shuttle to the airport. Our flight was delayed and didn鈥檛 depart until 5:30 PM. Flight was 4 hours. Provided in-flight movie, toasted panini and a fruit bar, and continual update via monitor of flight location, altitude and speed. Nice touch. Flight was comfortable. Minor complaints as a few kids were continually crying. Can鈥檛 help that. Landed at 9:30 PM. Didn鈥檛 have to adjust our watches. Same time zone.PUNTA CANA AIRPORT: (A) Our flight was the only group at the airport. Disembarked on the tarmac. We were requested to form a line and in this fashion we were escorted into the thatched roof airport. Girls wearing fruit on their head and national costumes took our picture as we entered the airport. They attempt to charge you $8 US for them on your return flight. Breezed through customs. $10 US tourist tax was already included so we didn鈥檛 have to fumble around for money. Just had to present tourist card which we were given upon boarding in Toronto. No problem collecting luggage. Locals fishing for a tip were waiting to carry your bags. We held on to our luggage and followed the Signature vacations signs to our awaiting vehicle. Our transportation was a small bus with a cart/trailer attached to the back for luggage.TRANSPORTION TO RESORT: (A) Paradisus Punta Cana is about 25 minutes from the airport. Our Signature representative assured us we would be the second drop off. Everybody else on the bus (15 passengers) were going to other resorts in the area. Tour rep spoke broken English during the drive and provided valuable tips and insight about the region. Evening drive to our resort was an eye-opener. Very impoverished countryside. Locals were either hanging out at the side of the road or driving scooters and small motorcycles at a high rate of speed without helmets. Roads were filled with huge pot holes and void of traffic lights or lines painted on them. Three guys on a motorcycle driving alongside our bus carrying a mattress provided a laugh.HOTEL LOCATION: Located on the easternmost tip of the Dominican Republic surrounded by both the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. It鈥檚 a huge coastline of sandy white beach and numerous all-inclusive resorts. Punta Cana would be best described as a village. No downtown area. All the hotels in Punta Cana have a security gate which you must pass through in order to enter the front of the property. If you leave the property you must show your wristband for re-entry through the front gate. Locals living in squalor are only a few hundred feet from the front gates of all the resorts we passed. We always felt safe and comfortable but heaven forbid if the natives had an uprising.CHECK-IN: (A) Arrived at 10:30 PM. Were greeted by a bellhop as we exited the bus who loaded our bags onto a golf cart. Very beautiful open air lobby but didn鈥檛 have the architectural WOW factor that we鈥檇 seen at other resorts (Paradisus Palma Real) we had frequented in the past. Numerous candles lit and incense burning. Very Zen like. Check-in was quick and painless. Gave us a map and explained where our room and restaurants were located. We were quietly concerned as according to the map our building appearing miles from the beach. We were situated in building 24. E-mailed the hotel prior to arrival to request a property map so we could familiarize ourselves with the property beforehand and requested a second floor room. Request granted. Were greeted with a lovely beverage while we completed our check-in. Lobby bar was to our right and had a handful of couples listening to a Latin guitarist. Very nice ambiance. The resort appeared very quiet. Perfect place for relaxation and solitude. Property was magnificent as we were driven to our room. Beautifully lit pathways. Tranquil music emitted from speakers disguised as rocks. Very romantic.ACCOMODATION: (A) Wow. Beautiful, clean, spacious room with a high vaulted ceiling. Exceeded our expectations. Bottle of champagne on ice, fresh flowers, towel animal on the bed and fruit basket awaited our arrival. We gave the fruit to the cleaning staff. King size bed was very comfortable. Not hard like other resorts we鈥檝e experienced. Nice pillows and duvet. Slept great. Air conditioning worked good and was almost too cold for sleeping. The temperature could be adjusted. Ceiling fan above bed. Sunken living room. Bathroom was divided in two areas. Sink that had a huge counter and closet behind it with mirrored doors. Full size door (not a saloon door that I had read) separated the toilet, bidet and shower/tub from the counter/dressing area. Much storage in bathroom. Iron. Ironing board. Umbrella. 2 Robes. TV which picked up CNN (CH 28), CNN International (CH 39), FOX NY (CH 56), ABC NY (CH 58) and the Golf channel. All the other stations were in Spanish. Safe provided for your valuables. Small fridge that contained 4 beers, 4 bottled waters and various flavored soft drinks (Coca Cola products). Coffee maker and 2 packages of coffee as well. Balcony that overlooked the grounds had two chairs, a table and a chaise lounge. Grounds are very impressive. Expected a slight musty odour in the rooms (due to the humidity in the Caribbean) and brought along a couple of airwicks. Didn鈥檛 need them. This was just a regular room (junior suite). No upgrade. Impressive. Nicest room I have stayed in at an all-inclusive resort. The property has 35 villa-style buildings. They are 2-stories tall and house 16 units. 10 of those buildings are dedicated to Royal Service clients. Building 24 is centrally located. Walk is 3 minutes from the majority of the restaurants and 5 minutes from the beach. The spa was located directly beside us and closed at 8 PM. Great neighbors as they didn鈥檛 make any noise. After 11 PM you can shoot a cannon through the resort. Very quiet. Only time I was awoken at night was during a big storm and a two-second power outage. Out of curiosity I got up to look out the window to witness the deluge. Occasionally you would hear conversation amongst European travelers returning to their room. Voices tended to carry in the stairway.CLEANING STAFF/ROOM SERVICE: (B) Minor complaints. Fridge wasn鈥檛 always restocked with water even after leaving a note. We learned quick and brought bottled water from the bar upon our return from the beach. Would leave a $2 tip daily. Once I left the remote control on the bed to hold down the tip (so it didn鈥檛 blow away due to the overhead ceiling fan). They took the remote control! Learned my lesson, hid the remote and used the ashtray to hold the tip. Key for the safe didn鈥檛 work our first night. Just brought it to the front desk (near the lobby bar) the following night for an exchange. Everything easily rectified. Requested extra pillows directly from the maid and received them. Noticed they would clean the rooms in our villa around 10 AM. By then we had already vacated our room and were sitting on the beach. Always came back to a clean room with lots of towels and fresh flowers. Cleaning staff doesn鈥檛 speak English but were very pleasant. Took a few extra seconds to communicate. No problem, you鈥檙e on holiday.Ordered room service twice. First time, half our order was missing. We didn鈥檛 bother complaining and blamed it on the language barrier. Second time everything was perfect. Food always came with a smile. Always gave them a tip regardless.FACILITIES: (A+) Outstanding. Beautiful. Amazing. Huge resort. Technically three resorts in one with somewhat shared facilities. Regular, Royal Service and Reserve (time share).Lobby area houses an air-conditioned casino, bar/lounge area, gift shop, tour operators (during the day), entertainment theater and a specialty restaurant (Fuego). Warning: The concierges (wearing white linen shirts and beige pants) in the lobby will approach you under the pretense of offering assistance for reservations to the specialty restaurants. They will give you a time share pitch for the Reserve side of the resort and other properties owned by Sol Melia. Why mix business with pleasure? The bar/lounge area comes somewhat alive at night depending on the time of week. Always some type of entertainment. Live music, dancing, fire show, DJ and even a disco with go-go dancers and light show. The lobby is separated from the villas by a mangrove/jungle area. It鈥檚 a good 5-10 minute romantic walk (especially at night) to your room. The pathways are softly lit and music is lightly piped in. The golf carts/trams are continually shuttling guests around the property. We preferred to walk. Why be in a hurry? You鈥檙e on vacation. You could even hitch a ride with the staff going to various areas of the resort. Warning: If you happen to be riding with a concierge they鈥檒l give you a time share pitch. Swinging benches are available in the lobby while waiting for a ride. A lazy American was complaining the carts didn鈥檛 run on a more frequent schedule for his liking. Royal Service side had its own small beautiful pool with swim-up bar. We tested the waters before politely getting the boot. Zero atmosphere as nobody was ever in it. Had their own roped-off section at the beach. Each room was assigned their own palapa and bali bed. Didn鈥檛 have to worry about the towel game. That appeared to be the only advantage and didn鈥檛 seem worth the extra money. Their villas appear identical from the outside. I can鈥檛 comment on the interior. Reserve (time share) area is off to one side, near the lobby, recently built thus more modern and not even close to the beach. Three storey buildings surround a pool that reminds me of Caesar鈥檚 Palace in Vegas. Incredible! We roamed over to this side three times: One evening while exploring the resort grounds, another for breakfast at the Gabi (VIP) buffet (met a pleasant group of travel agents from the St. Louis area who provided good insight to the Punta Cana area) and another time for dinner at one of the specialty a-la-carte restaurants (Vento) that is housed in this area. Property must be 700m wide and 1 km deep (rough estimate). Has thirty-five 2-storey, villa-style buildings. Each villa is divided in half so that the units either face the property inwards toward the pool area or outwards toward the neighboring properties. The buildings that house Royal service guests are closest to the ocean. I believe the only buildings that offer an ocean view in Royal service are 19, 25 and 30. It鈥檚 dark by 7:30 PM in the Dominican. There is a beautiful mangrove in the middle of the property with lit walkways. My wife claims not high heel friendly. Poured concrete to mimic cobblestone. Expected to see lots of wildlife roaming around. Only thing we saw were birds, flamingos and fire flies. Read on Trip Advisor to expect mosquitoes and bring bugspray. Never had to use it and my wife is susceptible. Grounds are lush and impeccably maintained. Nicest I have seen at an all-inclusive including the Paradisus Palma Real. Staff is continually cleaning, polishing, raking and cutting. A stunningly huge lagoon pool that was in the middle of the property near the beach and restaurants. Fresh water and very warm (not refreshing). It housed a swim-up bar and area for water polo and basketball. Was surrounded by lounge chairs, palapas and bali beds. Daily free scuba diving trials in the pool at 9:30 AM sharp. Towel hut was nearby (open from 8 AM-6 PM). Gift shop in the lobby. Suntan lotion was $20 US. Free copies of the Miami Herald (International Edition) available in the stand beside the Public Relations desk. Internet service is available but I never inquired about the price. Massage palapas by the pool and on the beach. Gym and tennis courts near the lobby. Never used them as we were there to relax. On site dive shop (Scuba Caribe) for booking dive excursions, free snorkel rentals, catamarans ($6 daily) and kayaks. Tour operators in the lobby. Separate secluded spa area (beside buiding 24) with its own pool surrounded by massage cabanas. Very peaceful and serene with incense burning.BEACH: (A+). Breathtaking. Outstanding. Incredible. Without a doubt the nicest we had seen in Punta Cana as it was constantly being maintained. Nice breeze blowing off the ocean disguised the humidity. Incredible sand. Turquoise blue warm water. Staff was out every morning at 7 AM raking the accumulated overnight seaweed (more like grass clippings) and picking up empty beer cans and drink containers from people utilizing the beach in the evening. Why people are so lazy that they can鈥檛 walk 10 feet to the numerous trash cans is beyond me?!? Gardener raking fallen coconuts from an evening storm was chopping the tops with his machete. Paid him a few bucks, grabbed a straw from the buffet and away I went. Beach had a roped off area to keep away parasail boats, kayaks and catamarans. Never saw any jet skis. Our preferred spot was under the numerous palapas that housed the bali beds. I was up at 7 AM and placed our complimentary beach towels at our preferred location. The bali beds were like kryptonite. So comfortable and relaxing that once you sat in them they sucked all your energy and you didn鈥檛 want to move. Great place for an afternoon nap which we did often. A few people were obviously out earlier securing palapas along the pool or the beach. Didn't bother us in the least bit. Plenty of spots were available and regular lounge chairs were plentiful. Royal service (roped-off beach area) had their own bali beds and palapas assigned to their rooms and didn鈥檛 have to get up early to play the towel game. Everyday we would be at the beach by 10 AM and it was starting to get busy. The occasional topless woman provided a European influence. Only complaint about the Europeans on the beach was that some would be conversing so loudly amongst themselves you would think they were 50 feet away from each other. Terrible if trying to nap. Others were completely oblivious and never thought anything about smoking 5 feet from you without taking in account the wind direction. Being Canadian we were too polite to complain. Instead when securing my morning palapa/bali bed I would move at least 10 lounge chairs within a 20 foot radius to another locale. Problem solved. People were too lazy to reorganize their chairs and we remained undisturbed the balance of our stay.There were a few vendors walking the beach selling cigars, necklaces, straw hats and parasailing rides. Same vendors everyday. Mildly annoying but hearing their daily sales pitch was humorous. 鈥淪mokey time. Good cigars. Cheap. Cheap!鈥?and 鈥淧arasailing. Banana Boats. Snorkeling.鈥?I was surprised how far up the resort they would roam until security booted them closer to the ocean. Just ignore them or a simple 鈥淣o鈥?and they wouldn鈥檛 bother you. Hotel employed photographers offering to have your picture taken with monkeys, iguanas, parrots. Prints available at the beach/pool photo shop (next to the towel hut) for $10 US. Went for a daily morning walk. You are able to walk the beach along all the properties without a hassle. Minor police presence as well as hotel security. Twice our walks were two hours in length. Glad we did our research and stayed at the Paradisus as they had the nicest beach. When facing the ocean, walk to the right. After 20 minutes you鈥檒l come across a shanty type of flea market. Vendors are very aggressive and will try anything to get you to view their wares. Vendor will approach you; shake your hand and attempt to pull you inside, stating 鈥淵ou will make me money if you just look.鈥?They came across as polite until you say 鈥淣O鈥?and become all dour. All we could see from the beach was junk. Beaded jewelry, poetry, paintings鈥he typical tourist souvenirs. The walk to the left is much more picturesque. Once you round the point (15 minute walk) there are a few trees leaning on a 45 degree angle towards the ocean. Perfect picture spot. You will also view the Russian freighter that has been marooned on the reef since 1978. I鈥檓 estimating it to be about a 陆 mile from shore. Many people wind surfing, kayaking, and had catamarans close to the wreck. There is also another flea market type shopping area on the beach that appears more polished. Tents and employee shirts are yellow. We were never approached or bothered. Eventually you鈥檒l pass the RIU properties. For some reason they have beach erosion and the water smells of gasoline (due to high amount of motorized water activity). Never saw a beach as nicely maintained as the Paradisus. Beach. That includes the beaches in the Mexican Mayan Riviera.Observed the Paradisus staff setting up for a wedding on the beach. Beautiful location. We never witnessed the ceremony but observed a large-thong-wearing-topless woman posing for pics and using the archway as a stripper pole. My wife remarked the bride would have been appalled. We found it mildly entertaining.Pelicans constantly flying overhead, dive-bombing the ocean in search of fish.BARS: (A) Smartest move we made was bringing 52-ounce thermal mugs to the beach. Saved us from having to make many trips to the beach bar for refills. Also took them with us when we went for walks. Immediately tipped the bartenders at the beach bar $5 US to set the tone early. They were very generous with the alcohol and always happy to see us. We tipped them $2 US every time we refilled our mugs. We actually had to tell them to go easy on the booze as the drinks were too strong. Everybody else drank from the small plastic tumblers provided. Fools. We drank plenty of delicious tropical drinks all week. Beach cocktail service was only available to Royal Service patrons as you relaxed in your lounge chair but I didn't see the drinks coming very quick. It was extremely hot and we were thirsty. Beer was either Heineken or Presidente. The lobby bar was beautiful in the evening. They would always have some type of entertainment. Tipped the bartender $2 US after every drink order and they were most appreciative. The high-end liquor was kept here and on display. Bombay Gin. Absolute Vodka. Coldest beer on the property. Free cigars are also available. Trick is to order your drinks, produce a tip and then ask for a cigar. I noticed no tip meant they didn鈥檛 have cigars. We usually had an after dinner drink or a cappuccino before retiring for the evening. They even have bali beds at the lobby bar with cocktail service.Swim-up bar always had a small crowd but never a wait. Tipped them $2 US and they were grateful. Swim-up bar isn鈥檛 adults only as its part of the main pool. Staff who conducted the merengue lessons had a Miss Paradisus contest in front of the swim-up bar. Provided a good laugh. Adults only swim-up bar in the Royal Service section. Absolutely beautiful. Walked past numerous times and noticed nobody was ever there and had zero atmosphere. There is a small bar area/lounge in the main food building. People would have a drink while waiting to enter the restaurants or an after dinner drink.Apparently people frequent the disco (Mangu) a few resorts over (Occidental Grand). We saw the sign from the road and were somewhat concerned as it looked run down and heard the locals mingle with tourists. Can鈥檛 confirm this as we never attended.FOOD: (B+) Tried to make reservations for the specialty a-la-carte restaurants via e-mail prior to our arrival. Request denied. No problem. All dinner reservations are made in the main food building that also houses the breakfast/dinner buffet. Concierges鈥?desk for dinner reservations is located at the front entrance. Staff doesn鈥檛 arrive until 8 AM. Made all our dinner reservations in one visit for the duration of our stay. Menus are available to preview. All of our reservations were for 9:30 PM (claimed that鈥檚 all they had available). We didn鈥檛 care, weren't in a hurry and wanted to relax. We always showed up early for our dinner reservations (sometimes an hour early) and never had to wait. We always left a tip to our server. Note: The reservations run on a weekly basis starting on Sunday. Noticed a large line on Sunday mornings as new bookings are taken for the week. Warning: Time share concierges are lurking in this area. While you鈥檙e waiting in line they will attempt to persuade people to attend a VIP breakfast (time share presentation). Minor nuisance. Ignore them! We ate at the following restaurants and have ranked them based on preference:1) French (El Romantico): Only air conditioned restaurant located in the main food building. This is a specialty a-la-carte restaurant that required a reservation and long pants for gentlemen. I had a beautiful shrimp appetizer while my wife had duck and a crab salad. We both had beef tenderloin with baked potato as our mains. Cooked to perfection. Decadent dessert. Great food presentation. We split a bottle of wine. Beware all of the a-la-carte specialty restaurants have two wine lists. One that lists wine that is included for all inclusive guests; another that lists wine that cost extra ($50 to $250 US per bottle). The all-inclusive list was fine with us (were not wine snobs) and had some decent wines. Our server Richard was great and spoke pretty good English.2) Dolce Vita (Italian): Located in the main food building. Does not require a reservation nor a dress code. Open air (it鈥檚 hot) and also has a few palapa covered tables on stilts surrounded by a pond. Flamingos are hanging around waiting for a handout. Open from noon till at least 11 PM. We ate here a few times. Great pizzas, tomato mozzarella salad, beef carpaccio and gnocchi. We would often have lunch here as well. Bathing suits must be dry (they will touch you to check) or you must have a pool towel to sit on. We often had the same server, Moises, who spoke minimal English but was funny. 3) Fuego (Latin Bistro): Air conditioned (very cold) and located in the lobby. This is a specialty a la carte restaurant that required a reservation and long pants for gentleman. We had octopus, shrimp and tortilla soup. My main was somewhat disappointing and was similar to a fajita. Food presentation and d茅cor was unbelievable. Very hip and trendy vibe. Something you would see in downtown Toronto. Server did not speak English and was somewhat off in terms of timely and accurate drink delivery. No problem as we were on vacation. Manager was very warm, spoke excellent English, meticulously dressed (tailored suit) and always walking around checking on the patrons. Perhaps this made the staff nervous. Restaurant turns into a lounge after 11 PM. 4) Vento (Mediterranean): Air conditioned and located on the Reserve side of the resort. This is a specialty a la carte restaurant that required a reservation and long pants for gentleman. Stylish decor, great food presentation and decent food. Had a great table and good service.We had the usual fare. Salad, soup and a nice chicken dish. We passed on dessert and opted for a coffee at the lobby bar. Very quiet atmosphere, soft music and low lighting, very sedate.5) Albufera (Steak): Located in the main food building. Does not require a reservation nor a dress code. The steak was decent. Always order the tenderloin. My wife polished off a bottle of champagne during dinner. Richard from El Romantico was our server. Great service once again. They must rotate their servers throughout the various restaurants.6) Marino (Seafood): Great ambiance with a nice ocean breeze. My wife is a huge seafood fan and was somewhat disappointed. She enjoyed her octopus appetizer and seafood soup. Our main course was grilled lobster covered in a lime sauce. Terrible. This restaurant houses the beachside lunch buffet during the afternoon. We wound up going to Dolce Vita to satisfy our hunger.There鈥檚 a Japanese restaurant (Sakura) on site but apparently was booked all week. Truthfully we never saw it open. Didn鈥檛 matter as we had lots of options. There鈥檚 also a Brazilian (Rodizzio) and Chinese (Pavillion) restaurant in the main food building. They didn鈥檛 require a reservation and weren鈥檛 air conditioned. We never ate there but an American couple told us the Chinese was good. Prior to our stay we had read about a Mexican restaurant on the premises but never found it, nor was it located on the property map.Breakfast buffet was good. Located in the main open-air food building called Hibiscus. Large selection of breads, baked goods, fruit, cheese (brie, goat) and meats (prosciutto). Great bacon and coffee. Omelettes and fruit smoothies made to order. Could always find something good to eat. Pretty much the same offering every day. No flies or birds. All the food is displayed in an air-conditioned area. I believe it opened at 7 AM as it was pretty empty. I would head to the beach every morning with towels to secure our bali bed, stop by the buffet and grab a coffee, fruit and croissant. Head to the room and watch CNN while my wife got organized. We would be back at the breakfast buffet at 8 AM. Service was good and we鈥檙e not above getting up and helping ourselves to juice or coffee. Hibiscus closes at lunch and reopens for dinner. We never ate here for dinner as we frequented the a-la-cartes. My wife walked in to investigate and said the selection was decent. Hibiscus closes at lunch and food is served at the large beachside palapa. They had great hamburgers, sausage, fries and regular buffet fare. Hamburgers were grilled to order and would be a 5 minute wait. Watched an American have a fit because he had to wait a few extra minutes for his burger. Wound up stomping off empty handed. Why get excited? You鈥檙e on vacation. Where do you have to be in 5 minutes? Lunch buffet was more relaxed as everybody was in swimsuits.We strolled over to the Reserve (time share) side of the resort for breakfast one morning. It鈥檚 called the Gabi (VIP) buffet breakfast area. We had been offered the VIP breakfast so often by the concierges (veiled attempt at a time share pitch), we figured they must be offering them to every Tom, Dick and Harry. The trick was you had to attend the breakfast area with a concierge so they could show you around, couldn鈥檛 escape and basically held hostage for a 2-hour presentation (so I heard). Forget that crap! We just walked in on our own. Worst case scenario, we would be asked to leave. Everybody鈥檚 wristband labeled Reserve, ours Paradisus. Nobody even raised an eyebrow. Breakfast was a minor step-up to the offering in the regular Hibiscus buffet in a more modern facility. Irony was we passed all the time share concierge鈥檚 having a pump-up meeting in the lobby on our way back from Gabi鈥檚. No doubt plotting to prey on unsuspecting tourists.When we booked the Paradisus Punta Cana we also looked at the Paradisus Palma Real. It was $1000 more per person per week. Spoke to the Public Relations desk at our resort regarding reciprocating privileges and inquired about having dinner there. Gave them the spiel we intended to come back to a Paradisus resort in Punta Cana and wanted to see if the Palma Real was worth the extra $$. Claimed the only time they allow guided tours are on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Dinner is an extra $75 US per person. Told her politely to go whistle. Our resort provides transportation to the Palma Real shopping mall which is obviously close to the Paradisus Palma Real. As you can guess we took advantage of the 15 minute free ride, strolled around the open-air mall (which was a waste of time) and crashed the Palma Real. It鈥檚 a good 10 minute walk from the mall. Our bus driver was shuttling people to the resort, recognized us and gave us a lift. No problem walking on the property right through the front lobby. Same wristband. Had dinner in their main buffet area. Beautiful setting. Definitely a step up from the offering at the Paradisus Punta Cana. They had a large Mexican selection which we enjoyed.  We took advantage of room service twice. Just ordered basics like pizza, shrimp cocktails and hamburgers.Just to be safe we took two shots of Pepto Bismal and an Imodium tablet everyday. Never had any stomach problems.ACTIVITIES/ENTERTAINMENT: (A) There is a sports complex in the middle of the property. Rock climbing wall, batting cages, and archery. They have bikes available for guests and we took advantage. We showed up at 5:45 PM not knowing they close at 6 PM. They still let us take them and told us just to park them beside the locked bikes upon our return. We tipped him a few bucks. Bikes aren鈥檛 in the greatest condition (you have to pick through the selection to find one without flat tires or missing chain) and have only one gear. We explored the whole property and even inadvertently rode through the staff quarters and watched them playing basketball. My wife was pleased their accommodations were pretty decent. We even saw where the horse and carriage (for weddings) was housed. There was always some form of scheduled activity going on at beach in front of the activity hut (beside the dive shop). Volleyball, bocce, aerobics, soccer, meringue lessons and basketball. None of these activities were intrusive. You didn't feel obligated to participate nor was it so loud that it would be disruptive if you were only interested in relaxing. Free SCUBA diving that was offered in the pool at 9:30 AM sharp. You had to make a reservation a day in advance. Boogie boards were available for a $10 US refundable deposit. We used them a few times later in the afternoon as the ocean became rougher. Awesome.Catamarans are available for $6 an hour. You have to make a reservation a day in advance. We went out twice at 10 AM. My wife was initially hesitant as we watched a couple attempting to bring one to shore and almost flipped it due to the waves. I reassured her I had experience piloting these boats (lie). First time we took it out, we inadvertently extended our sail by an extra hour. Wind was awesome and we sailed to the left (past the Russian freighter) beyond the remaining resorts. Getting back was somewhat problematic as we had to zig-zag back into the wind. Staff was great but we felt so bad we brought them pizza and Coca-Cola from Dolce Vita. They were most pleased. We rented a catamaran again the following day. This time we didn鈥檛 go beyond our designated hour. Staff greeted us as we sailed into the beach. As we hauled it up shore we watched a cable snap and the mast came crashing to the ground. Luckily it didn鈥檛 hit anyone. Provided a good laugh and they reassured us that it was an easy repair. Again we felt so bad we brought them more pizza and Coca-Cola from Dolce Vita.One day we went horseback riding on the beach. You book in advance at the activity hut. Two trips daily. 9:30 AM and 1:30 PM. Doesn鈥檛 cost anything. A truck with an overhead tarp picks you up in the lobby. It makes a few pit stops on route at other resorts to pick up more participants. Ranch is located beside the Barcelo and Bahia Principe resorts. Horses were not well kept. Dogs roaming the premises were infested with fleas. Brought a few women in our group close to tears. They supplied helmets. I would recommend you wear a cap underneath. Guides led you through the hotel staff entrance (which was not nice compared to the Paradisus) to an undeveloped beach. Beautiful. Absolutely amazing. Large waves crashing against the shore. Wish I had a boogie board! Horses required minimal guidance and were quite familiar with the route which was along the waters edge. You could gently steer them towards the water up to their knees. Passed a local who was spear fishing and had quite a haul. Wish I took a picture. I suspect the horseback riding along this route will eventually end as a massive resort was under construction. Can鈥檛 see a hotel allowing horses to poop on their property. Ride lasted 45 minutes. Your pictures are taken by staff during the ride and placed on rum bottles for purchase. Met a very nice family from New Jersey who provided some entertaining commentary during the truck ride. Round trip was 3 hours and worth the $10 US tip. Again passed many locals living in squalor just outside the entrances to all the resorts. Sad.There is an air conditioned theater near the lobby used for nightly variety shows. I believe they started around 10 PM but we never attended. The performers were very friendly as they would walk through the restaurants reminding everyone of the nightly entertainment. There were signs posted throughout the resort regarding the evening performance (Michael Jackson, Latin Theme, Movie Theme).One early evening we caught the complimentary bus to the Palma Real shopping mall. 15 minute ride. Was an open-air mall that had a Tony Roma鈥檚, Hard Rock Caf茅, Ocean Pacific and Movie Theater. We just browsed around and nothing really caught our eye. Asked a security guard for directions to the Paradisus Palma Real but he couldn鈥檛 understand English. Eventually spoke with another security guard who pointed us in the right direction. Long driveway to the resort. We walked about 5 minutes before being passed by the bus driver who initially dropped us at the mall. He stopped to shuttle us to the Palma Real which saved us a 10 minute walk. Showed our wrist band to security at the main gate. Wow! From an architectural standpoint this place blows away the Paradisus Punta Cana. Lobby is raised above the rest of the property. You look out through a courtyard, across the pool with a clear shot of the ocean. Beautiful property. Appears recently built. Much different layout than the Paradisus Punta Cana. Everything is more compact. Property isn鈥檛 as deep but is wider. Grounds aren鈥檛 near as lush. Lots of concrete. Stunning nevertheless. Reminds me of a smaller version of the Bellagio in Vegas. All the specialty al-la-carte restaurants are on the perimeter of the courtyard. Pool is massive. Beach has bali beds but doesn鈥檛 seem as nice. Lobby bar is gorgeous. Can hear plans flying overhead due to its close proximity to the airport. Dinner buffet was great. Better selection than our resort. I鈥檝e read on Trip Advisor that this resort is also heavy on the time share pitch. Not sure if it鈥檚 worth an extra $1000 per person per week. Would definitely consider if it was few hundred dollars more. Cab ride back to our resort was $18 US. Passed by a bar that had hundreds of locals milling about outside. WEATHER: (A+) Fantastic. 47 degrees celcius everyday (factoring in the humidex). It was very hot and obviously humid. People who have complained on Trip Advisor regarding the heat make me laugh. What would you expect in the Caribbean during the summer? Sunny everyday. Had to be near water to cool off or near the ocean with the strong breeze. Rained a few nights after 12 AM. Wind howling and torrential downpour. Had dried up by the time we awoke. Were initially concerned about hurricane season when booking. Wasn't even a factor. Bring a hat, sunscreen, sunglasses, enjoy a cool beverage and seek shade often. The bali beds near the ocean provided shade and a nice breeze. CLIENTELE: (B+) Spoke with many nice people from all over the world. Mostly European patrons. People were friendly, not intrusive and there for relaxation. Noticed some people rude and disrespectful to the staff (unfortunately American). Some topless European women on the beach. No big deal. A few noisy, smoking Europeans. Lots of couples and families. Kids were very well behaved and mostly hung out near the pool area and the lobby with their families after dinner. The property is very quiet at night. Wouldn't recommend for those seeking a party-spring-break-atmosphere. DEPARTURE: (F) Signiture has a kiosk in the lobby. We never attended the welcome briefing as it was at 11:30 AM (prime beach time) and they usually try to sell tours. We never saw our Signature rep as we were only in the lobby during the evening. Looked at the book that informed us of our 5:30 PM departure time. Signature reps phone number is available if you have any questions or concerns. Checkout time is 12 PM. $10 US for each additional hour. Spoke with the front desk and they let us have our room till 3 PM au gratis. Claimed the room key would have to be reprogrammed to work after 12 PM. My wife was skeptical and we tried with no problems. Lobby has shower facilities (not air-conditioned) and an area to store your luggage. Checkout at 3 PM was quick and painless. Stashed our luggage and headed back to the beach. Headed to the lobby bar at 5 PM to enjoy a few more cocktails while awaiting our Signature bus to the airport. Bus arrived on time and made a pit stop to another resort for more passengers. Check in at airport was uneventful and were provided $10 US voucher for Wendy鈥檚. That should have been a tip off. Pictures that were taken upon our entrance to the airport a week earlier were on display and available for purchase $8 US. Not happy when you told them too expensive. Flight was departing from the new Terminal 2 (air conditioned). Had plenty of time to meander the airport before our 9:30 PM flight. There wasn鈥檛 much to look at. Had a few stores and places to eat which all close at 9 PM. Outdoor playground to keep kids occupied. Announcement made at 7 PM that our flight was delayed until 11:30 PM. By 9:30 PM the passengers for our flight were the only ones left at the airport. It was then that we noticed half the passengers that came on our flight from Toronto were conspicuously absent. Suspected the other tour operators (Sunwing, Sunquest) had tipped off their patrons about the delay. At 10 PM our flight was cancelled (maintenance problems in Toronto) until the morning. Collected luggage. Signature provided bus ride to Natura Park for overnight accommodations. It was relatively close to the airport. Hotel to be commended for keeping the buffet open and accommodating a large group of hostile travelers at 11 PM. Best described as a lodge you would see in Northern Canada. Very rustic. Horrible karaoke in the lobby. Room was dark, dingy, musty and very outdated. Small pillows. Double beds. No towels or remote for the TV. AC didn't work in some rooms according to our group. Better than spending the night in the airport. After spending one week at the Paradisus Punta Cana this was an unbelievable downgrade. I checked the rates on itravel2000 and this place was only $200 cheaper per person per week. Best analogy would be from staying one week at the Plaza Hotel in New York to a room at a Motel 6. Bus picked us up at 5 AM for return to airport. Many people complaining about their accommodations. Suggest if one is considering the Natura Park to pay a little more and stay at another resort in the area. Check in at airport very easy. Didn鈥檛 have to go through customs again. One guy had to pay $50 extra for his luggage as it supposedly exceeded the weight limit although it was acceptable in Toronto. Again we were the only group in Terminal 2. Spoke with vacationers who we had seen on our flight down but didn鈥檛 see at the airport last evening. They had booked with other tour companies (not Signature) and had been given advance warning of the plane cancellation and stayed at their resorts. Intend to contact Signature and complain. Upon boarding plane, two passengers discovered that their seat numbers did not exist as a different model of plane flew us down from Toronto. Scramble to accommodate them. Plane from Toronto landed in Punta Cana at 7:30. We departed at 8:30 AM. Apologies and $75 voucher to be used towards another Skyservice flight. 4 hour flight. Provided in-flight movie, breakfast, complimentary alcoholic beverage, earphones and continual update via monitor of flight location, altitude and speed. Screaming Greek Canadian family still livid about flight delay. Otherwise uneventful flight. Landed at 12:30 PM. Luggage delayed 40 minutes. Waited 10 minutes for the Doubletree Toronto Airport shuttle. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: (A) Rave reviews. Perfect spot for a relaxing holiday. Lots of food options. Incredible beach and property. Impeccably maintained grounds. Brought $100 US for tips. Great value for our money. Helps to speak a little Spanish but not essential. Only staff who spoke English were in a position of authority. Other than the constant harassment by a few employees regarding the time share, the remainder of staff was wonderful. Check your attitude at the door and smile, you鈥檙e on vacation. Wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to recommend this resort.

<Content>Paradisus is GREAT - would go again We stayed at The Reserve, Family Concierge from Aug 5 - Aug 12. We are a couple in our mid-30's with two young children. The object of our stay was to relax and our kids have fun.We paid for a regular taxi ($35) from the airport directly to the resort. No problems.We checked in at The Reserve area of the resort with speedy service and no problems what-so-ever. Our concierge guy was wonderfully helpful and everything was great.The Reserve area is very modern with contemporary decor and is extremely clean. I only speak English and all staff were more than helpful. My husband speaks Spanish and also had great service.Our room was spacious and clean. With the family concierge plan the concierge actually books your table reservations for you at the a la carte restaurants which was a great help. Some times were not exactly what we had asked for, but at least we didn't have to wait in line.The food was ok, not wonderful, but not awful.The evening entertainment was amateur, but entertaining.My kids (6 and 4) loved Kids Zone and there seemed to be plenty of supervised activities scheduled throughout the day.We arranged hotel babysitting on two evenings, which was $10 per hour and both times it was the hotel reception staff. They were very nice and my children liked them a lot.We have traveled a lot to many different countries and are always aware of our surroundings. The safety deposit box is available in the room, therefore all our valuables were locked in there - why take the chance?We did tip a dollar for drinks, food etc. Nothing major, just something to show our appreciation.We spent a lot of time reading all the reviews before making the decision to stay at Paradisus Punta Cana. We are glad we made the decision.We walked along the beach and looked at some of the other resorts and our beach area was by far more superior, clean and had much better furniture and lounge chairs.We will be staying here again. The entire experience was totally what we were looking for.

<Content>Relaxing, Fun, Great for kids. Read helpful hints for a better stay. Details in a nutshell.Rooms: Spacious, Good A/C, Clean, Somewhat musty. A bit dated.Beach: Silky sand. Clean, deep beach, good surf, windy  comfortable break from the heat.Restaurants: Specialty restaurants are incredible. Fuego, Vento, Sakura, Romanitico - in that order. Book all reservations at the beginning of your stay. Buffets average, but adequate.Drinks: almost never a wait.Shade: always available at beach  pool.Staff: accommodating  very friendly.Excercise room: quite small, but good equipment  good A/C.Insects: almost no bugs anywhere (this is jungle).Entertainment: Surprisingly good. Mediterranean dance was great.Kids Zone: Very fun for our 10  13 year old. We checked them in and out at will. Staff is very good. Thomalia, Sarah.Resort is big. Shuttle runs constantly if you need it.Issues: Communication is very difficult, if you don't speak spanish quite well. Misunderstandings frequent. Rooms towels and spoons in short supply. Heat is INSANE from 1-4, so seek shelter. Difficult to book included specials such as sailing  snorkeling - a big pain. Reservations for restaurants  water sports seem to be held mostly for those staying in the very high-end Reserve. Do NOT do the tour of the Reserve. Staff gets a commission for sending people  it's worth a lot of money to them, but it's a time-share concept, even though they deny it. We did it to help out the gal who wanted the commission, but it was a sleazy concept to charge a ton of money to provide extra pampering concierge service - and those of us who pay thousands are just regular common folk.... Be warned, horseback riding is off-site. Some folks did it and liked it, but said that the horses were very skinny and the ride there is rough to see, if you know what I mean. (Not sure about the implications of the foot-mouth disease and the customs questionnaire about visiting a farm or ranch during your visit.). Lastly, bring a glade plug-in, a bar of soap, your own shampoo, and your spanish/english dictionary. Contact me if you want more info.

<Content>Beautiful Resort Horrible Food The resort is beautiful with all the nature and flowers everywhere. We went for a wedding and stayed in the Reserve side of the resort. We had to pay an additioal $100 for the week  it was well worth it! The Reserve has it's own pool and swim up bar and it is much nicer than the other side. It also has lunch right there  they'll bring it to you by the pool. The rooms are new and big. The are all marble with flat screen TVs  jacuzzi baths. When you stay on the Reserve side only people there can use the facilities, so you never have a problem getting towels or chairs. It is farther from the beach, but it's a quick walk or easy golf cart ride. We did get a couples massage and it was very relaxing  one of the best I've ever had.The only disappointing part was the food, we think. We went down with a large group of 50 people and by the end of the trip almost everyone had become sick with stomach problems. Some lasting days. We assume it was the food which really is not that great. The best lunch food is Pizza and believe it or not the best restaurant is the Chinese place, which does not require reservations. If you want to go to the Japanese, Mediterranean or Island fusion restaurant you need to make reservations where you have to stand in a long line, so I recommend getting it over with on the 1st day.The staff is very friendly  nice, but when you ask them to do something they don't usually you always get a No. Overall I don't think I'd go back b/c I am a food person  that's an important part of a trip for me. But the resort is clean beautiful  relaxing.

<Content>Nightmare in Paradise !!!!!!!!!! Where do i begin??? Let's see when we first walked in the hotel we were told at the front desk that our room was ready. To make a long story short when we got to the room it was a mess as if someone had just checked out. Going back to the part of first walking in we were encountered by a concierge named Leonardo. He told us we were staying in the reserve section of the hotel. Which is suppossedly the newer and better part. He said we had access to the private pool and beach. The next day we had found out that was a lie. We asked the bartender at the reserve section for a drink and were denied. Going back to our lying concierge Leonardo we did not confront him because we were on vacation and didnt want to deal with headaches so we left it as is.Our second day Leonardo invited us for breakfast at the Gabi restaurant. He never prepared us for any of the following.... he told us we would get a free gift for walking through the property. OK.. so we agreed. To find out when we got there it would be a 90 minute time share presentation..which i need to say turned out to be 2 1/2 hours long. We had a pleasant young lady escort us and show us through but later encountered by a beast named Randolf. I don't know where they find these time share people. Randolf was rude and highly unprofessional. He was trying to belittle my wife and I. Constantly laughing at us and making nasty comments. To much to write. All i have to say is whoever decides to go to this hotel BEWARE!!!! We complained about this uneducated man immediately and nothing was done.!!!!!!Lets now go to the service of the hotel. Let's see WHAT SERVICE! This place sucks!!! To put it simple. If you need a spoon bring one from home. If you need a fork bring your own. If you need soda go get it yourself at the bar before you eat . As a matter of fact get 3 or 4 drinks so you don't have to keep getting up. These people don't ask their guests if they would like refills . They throw away your food and drinks if you get up at the buffet. There is no service for food or drinks on the beach area. So if your used to that like we are you are in for a huge dissapointment.One more heads up about this place. You must remind that appetizers come before the main course at those so called reservation only restaurants. Like Fuego at the Paradisus.I strongly urge my fellow vacationers to never, ever stay at this MELIA/PARADISUS PUNTA CANA property . If you must stay at a melia property I would say go to the PALMA REAL it may cost more but you will be treated accordingly. We have stayed at other properties in Punta Cana and the Carribean and this hotel is horrible. Food was limited because all the resatraunts were on different schedule which means you had to find out on the day ofto eat. Front desk had no clue what was open when. The food was outright bad not much options. Dont waste your time.

<Content>Not even close to "impeccable service" This was my first all inclusive experience and based solely on the Paradisus Punta Cana Website boasting facilities and impeccable service (that) are the perfect elements to add to your escape into paradise, my expectations were set. I was looking for a quick getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life; a place where I could relax and melt into the Caribbean sands. The all-inclusive notion appealed to me because I wanted to get away and not think about what to do and where to eat.Check-in was smooth and the clerk was jovial and even made dinner reservations for me at the gourmet French restaurant. I arrived to my Deluxe Junior Suite Garden View with Jacuzzi to discover an overwhelming odor of mildew. I immediately called the guest services representative stating my concern, to which the representative unapologetically replied, We have no other rooms available. After reiterating my concern and disappointment and asking if I should sleep outside, the representative advised he would check with the manager and that I should call him back in two hours. The room itself was satisfactory, but hardly deluxe. The Jacuzzi was located in the bathroom 1 foot away from the commode. The mattress was extra firm and the fabric on the furniture was stained and faded. The walls and base boards showed evidence of mold growth. Coughing and wheezing, I left the room and decided I would go to dinner and deal with the room after a good meal. I arrived at the French restaurant, half-heartily greeted by the hostess who eyed me up and down and said that she could not seat me because my Armani capri pants where not long enough and that I needed to have long pants. I asked her to reconsider and both she and the manager at her side refused. Feeling hungry, tired, sick, and annoyed I went back to my deluxe mildew suite, grabbed my suit case, and returned to the front desk.I explained my room problem and my lack of long trousers in the Caribbean and the clerk advised she would change my room and offered to allow me to borrow pants from the hotel tomorrow. Next, she rang for the guest service representative that I spoke with previously to show me to my new room. The new, identical room was located directly across from the old room (I thought there were no other rooms available). And upon entering the room, I was attacked by an utterly overwhelming smell of bad, chemical, air freshener mixed with an underlying scent of mildew. My disdain was evident, but the guest service representative wasn't interested in a resolution and I was exhausted and hungry. I opened the window and turned on the fan and went for the buffet where I encountered additional qualms regarding service and food.The inconsistent trends in service, facilities, and food continued for the remainder of my trip and were far from the impeccable claims of the Paradisus Punta Cana Website. I would never return and never recommend this resort and most likely never return to the Dominican Republic. There are too many other places and hotels in the world and for the money one can do much, much better. Please look elsewhere to spend your precious time and money.

<Content>Beware of Theives..... I just returned from my trip late last night and I need to report an incident that happened at the Paridisus, which I am extremely upset about. On our last night, August 10th personal items were stolen from our hotel room. Since it was our last night there, we had started to pack our luggage and left almost everything packed before we went out to dinner and a show. The next morning while we were getting ready to leave we noticed that some items we had already packed away were missing. The items that were stolen were a cell phone and an Ipod and special adapters and chargers for both. We contacted hotel security right away. When security arrived to our room they quickly looked around and told us that they usually don't have this sort of thing happen, and they were sure that our items would show up in our luggage. They did nothing further and I couldn't really follow up since, we were already set to check out and head to the airport. I am really shocked that a hotel of this stature would treat it as if it were not a big deal and dismiss it as a mistake we did by misplacing the items. I am also surprised that theft would happen at a resort of this caliber.I write this review, so anyone who plans to stay there....please lock your stuff in the lock box....good luck

<Content>Stay in the Reserve Section We had a wonderful vacation with another couple at the Paradisus Punta Cana from July 17th to the 24th. We are very particular and were a little concerned with an all inclusive resort but after doing some research and speaking with many individuals, we selected this resort. We were not disappointed. We were strongly advised that we needed to make sure we were in the 鈥淩oyal Service鈥?area. This is the highest level of service and has a private pool and a host of other amenities. There are three levels of service, the 鈥淐ommon鈥? the 鈥淩eserve鈥?and the 鈥淩oyal鈥? Our travel agent got us two deluxe suites in the 鈥淩eserve鈥?section of the resort, which is one step below 鈥淩oyal鈥? but the 鈥淩eserve鈥?area of the resort is brand new 鈥?just opened in December 2007. We were going to upgrade to Royal when we got to the resort but after discussing it at check-in, we were advised to stay at the Reserve. We are very grateful we did because the suites were incredible. They were brand new, clean, nicely decorated and very comfortable. The large hot tubs in the suites were a very nice addition. We subsequently spoke with many individuals that stayed in the Royal area and almost without exception, they were all disappointed. They were given a tour of the Reserve area because the Reserve is part of a Vacation Club program they were selling at the resort. The Royal rooms were older, not as nicely decorated, and in need of updating. Although the service was slightly better than Reserve, they all felt it was not worth the extra cost. The Reserve and Royal have their own private areas of the beach and they have their own separate pools, but the Royal pool area is very small, for couples only 鈥?no children. It was a beautiful pool right next to the beach. The Reserve area was about a ten minute walk to the beach but there are golf carts that take you to and from the beach and restaurants. That was one only negative during our stay 鈥?they needed more carts. We had to wait sometimes as long as 20 minutes at dinner time to get a cart. While there appeared to be little difference between Royal and Reserve Service, the Common did not have the same amenities. Service in the Reserve area during breakfast and lunch was excellent. The waiters and waitresses were constantly refilling drinks and were very attentive. We ate in the Common area one day and the service was not nearly as good. It was basically self service for everything. Also, the Reserve and Royal areas had better stocked bars. With respect to beer, all the bars had Heineken and Presidente Beer (local) but the Royal and Reserve also had Corona. We were very pleased with the level of service we received and rivaled the most upscale hotels in the United States. We tried to tip often which I鈥檓 sure contributed to the level of service but we鈥檙e not talking about a significant amount of money. Our concierges were outstanding and anything we needed or wanted was taken care of and we were generous to them. They made the trip special. We also took care of the bartenders, beach runner who was constantly bringing us drinks and food, and the maids. Total out of pocket for the entire week was about $150 which wasn鈥檛 a great deal of money considering the total package, but it was worth every penny. During the week, we tried a different restaurant every night. For the most part we were pleased with every one but we aren鈥檛 talking five star quality. The restaurants were good, the food was well prepared, and the atmosphere was enjoyable. We ate at Italian, steak, Chinese French, Japanese, Mediterranean, Continental-Gabi. We enjoyed every one, except the steak restaurant - Albufera. Both couples had the porterhouse steak and we were disappointed with how it was cooked, the service, and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant. The resort had a ton of activities including all water sports, horseback riding, tennis (lessons included), a batting cage, archery, rock climbing, a full fitness gym, play areas for kids, and a spa. The casino, although small, was clean, enjoyable and not overly crowded. All of the activities were very good. There really was very little that we did not like about this resort and we are fairly particular individuals.The beaches were clean and the large palm umbrellas on the beach and by the pools were great. It was hot in the sun, but under the umbrellas it was very comfortable. Humidity wasn鈥檛 a major problem and there was always a nice breeze. We brought insect repellent but it really wasn鈥檛 needed. The resort must be doing something to control the insects because we didn鈥檛 have a problem. The only other negative was that during the day on the beach, there was a constant stream of guys trying to sell parasailing and other water sports outside of the resort, or cigars and jewelry. The security guards from the resort did a pretty good job keeping them away but they were a little annoying after a few days.The resort tries to push the Sol Melia Vacation Club. We were asked to attend a presentation a few times but we declined and it wasn鈥檛 a problem. Others that went felt that the price was unreasonable for what they were offering but we can鈥檛 verify that. There is a small shopping village of about 20 or 30 stores which is about a ten minute walk right outside the resort. It seemed safe and our concierge told us there are a lot of police, both in uniform and undercover, to protect the visitors. Prices were very reasonable for items and you can get them to lower the prices. Don鈥檛 take their first price. There is a very nice, upscale shopping mall nearby but people who went said the prices were very high. In summary, we had a great time at Paradisus Punta Cana and we would definitely go back provided we stay in the Reserve. I would not be happy staying in the Common area, and I probably would have been disappointed with the rooms in the Royal area.

<Content>Birthday Vacation The staff was wonderful, friendly, and oh so helpful.Although not allowed I tipped the staff and I did receive the royal service.The lobby and beach were beautifulThere was construction when I visitied.There is always the beach and the activites were not available because of the weather. Other than the beach the activites are limited. So it was more of a realxing vacation as opposed to an adventurous one. I really enjoyed myself. I would reccomend the hotel.

<Content>Paradisus Reserves TOP NOTCHED My family and I (11 of us) went and stayed at the new part called the reserves - absolutely lovely pool, rooms, and facilities. So glad we stayed here instead of the main section which was more crowded. The service was courteous, sometimes slow, but mostly good. The food was a little bland for my taste but good. My kids loved the pool and the beach. Overall would definitely recommend it. See if you can stay at the reserves

<Content>July 23-28, Paradisus Punta Cana DR Just returned from a 6 days/ 5 nights stay at the Paradisus Punta Cana Resort, and wanted to share some of the experience:RESERVATIONS. We reserved three rooms. One (for three people) through one of the major Travel websites. The other two rooms (one person per room) directly with the hotel. We had some trouble getting a quote for one person at the major website, so went directly to the hotel website and got a lower rate (major website was only able to give us rates for two persons in one room). Also called the hotel directly and had a very helpful and pleasant reservations coordinator help us. She even followed-up with e-mails to make sure we were fully satisfied. We were. ARRIVAL/AIRPORT. The arrival process was very quick and efficient. Taxicabs were waiting and willing to negotiate a lower rate than what initially offered. The standard fare from the airport to the Paradisus Punta Cana is USD$35 for a van (5 passengers).REGISTRATION. Our rooms were in The Reserve section of the resort. It has a separate Lobby and a very quick reservation process. No hassles whatsoever.THE FACILITIES: The Reserve section is a hotel within a hotel enclave inside the Paradisus Punta Cana Resort. It is a newer section, opened last Nov-Dec., located further back from the beach (you need to take a golf-cart to get to the beach) with eight three floors buildings around a very nice, large pool. The buildings are very clean and well maintained, with interior courtyards but NO ELEVATORS (this is important if you have problems climbing three flights of stairs). All suites, very nicely outfitted but with no direct ocean view. The best view is facing the pool. The landscaping throughout the resort is impressive, very tropical and very well kept. There are trains/trams and golf-carts constantly going around the resort (taking guests from their areas to the beach, lobby, pools, etc.).The buildings at the main (standard) part of the resort are all two-stories and a bit worn-out but closer (walking distance) to the beach. THE POOL: There are several pools throughout the resort but we used mostly the one set aside for guests at The Reserve. It is huge, with jaccouzzis, water falls, massage showers, coves, etc. It closes at 6 PM. There are some tanning water beds as well. Also, a kiddie pool with slides, fountains and cartoon characters. OTHER AMENITIES: There is a Casino at the main building Lobby and another one at the Restaurant area by the beach. There are a climbing rock, Spa and well equiped gym, a petting zoo and a tropical botanical garden. The Spa offers massages at about USD$100/hr (not included) and other treatments. Jaccouzzi and Saunas are free for all guests. You can have your massage by the pool or by the beach as well.There are nightly shows (at 10:30 PM) by a troupe of 15 dancers, lip-sinch'ing songs sometimes. Actually, it's better than it sounds, especially if you compare it to the shows at some other resorts (mostly of the High School variety). There is also live music and dancing at night at the main Lobby area.RESTAURANTS: There are two main sections: two restaurants at The Reserve (Gaby and Vento) and four restaurants grouped into one area close to the beach in the main resort section (Hibiscus, Albufera, Dolce Vita, and Seafood). There are two other separate restaurants (Romantico and Japanese). The Gaby is open and nice. No reservations needed for The Reserve guests (but required for other hotel guests). The Reserve guests have their breakfast buffet here, which is quite good. Vento is Mediterranean and only so-so. Albufera is the steakhouse and our major dissapointment: horrible service (it took more than one hour for our order to arrive) and terrible food (steaks were cold, over-cooked, and hard). Hibiscus has a good buffet and food was fine. The hotel guests have their breakfast buffet served here every day. On the better side: the Romantico (French) and Japanese (a tropical version of Benihana) restaurants had a bit better quality food (our expectations weren't to high for an all-inclusive resort). You get wine included with the meals (careful: ask for the wine included wine list or they'll give you one with extra costs) and japanese or chinese beers at the Japanese restaurant.Make sure to make reservations for the restaurants as soon as you register in the hotel. They are very difficult to come by, with the most popular ones fully reserved days ahead. This can be a hassle.THE BEACH: A bit rough, with some waves. The Paradisus Punta Cana is next door to the Barcelo Princess, a lower-cost/higher-density hotel, so there is a lot of traffic at the beach. Guests at The Reserve have a separate, cordoned-off section at the beach.THE STAFF: Very pleasant and willing to help, always with a smile. A tip opens some doors but not really needed every time. CONCLUSION: I stayed at the Colonial Majestic last year and found it to be less expensive, with far better beach and better food, even if the rooms are not as nice as The Reserve at the Paradisus Punta Cana (those darn hard mattresses!!). Paradisus' The Reserve has excellent, elegant accommodations but is not close to the beach, no ocean view and without elevators (the Majestic has elevators and good ocean views). Food is better at the Colonial Majestic. Your choice...

<Content>Wonderfully relaxing! We vacationed at the Paradisus July 19-July 26. The grounds of this facility are beautiful and well maintained. The beach is gorgeous and also well taken care of. We did not have Royal Service but our room was very large, clean, and comfortable and has a patio. My husband felt the bathroom needed updating and the door to the bathroom is saloon style so there isn't much privacy. A few ants, one monster palmetto bug, but nothing unexpected in this climate. I was afraid we might run out of soap so asked that housekeeper for some. It took multiple requests and we finally were given several bars on day 5. Same thing with washcloths. On the third day of asking we finally were given two but when they were taken away, they were not replaced. On day 5, after asking again and leaving a few dollars for her, we got washcloths again but then no bathmat. We had to call maintenance as the people above us flooded their jacuzzi and we had water pouring in from our bathroom ceiling, but maintenance came within 10 minutes and fixed the problem and then cleaned everything up. I think we only called for room service twice (we took cases of water from the housekeeping closet every day--no, no soap or washcloths there that I could have taken) and each time they came within 5 minutes. The pool is beautiful but it was just far too hot and we preferred the beach anyway. The food was very good and there are many dining options. Our concierge arranged dinner reservations for the Japanese, Mediterranean, Mexican, and French restaurants--all were excellent. The pizza in the Italian restaurant is great and available until 3 a.m. for eat in or take out. My steak at the steak house was among the best I have ever had and the Seafood restaurant was also very good. Breakfast was okay-nothing exceptional. There were plenty of lunch options in the buffets and two days we just opted for pizza. Liquors are not top shelf but bar service is great. There are only 2 beer choices-the local Presidente beer and Heineken--stick with Heineken. Although you are not suppose to have to tip, I would suggest you come with many one dollar bills because this ups the service astronomically. Once you tip, you are well remembered and well served. We went on 3 scuba dives and the reef is extremely healthy with a wide variety of fish. You can do a one tank dive every day-either morning or afternoon and it is free. You will have to pay for the 2nd dive if you choose to do this. The dive locations are within minutes by boat--it's a rough few minutes though. You will need to assist pushing the boat in the water. The equipment is in fairly good shape, though be sure to check to see if you have adequate air. Some gauges are in psi and others in bars. One day they set up 4 of us and the tanks had not been filled so we each had 1000-1500 psi until we told them so that set us back while they had to fill all the tanks. We would do the 9 a.m. dive and be back shortly after 10 which is a great way to start the day. It isn't the most organized activity but it's a nice freebie. The windsurfing, paddle boat, and canoeing are all included. Parasailing and some other water activities will cost you. Getting to the horse excursion was an adventure as you ride in the back of a farm truck to get there. The horses are not well cared for and are so used to going the same route that they are not easily veered from their course or speed. However, the ride really is alot of fun and the area of the beach you go to is deserted and absolutely beautiful. There are activities all day long--I tried to learn the merengue but really just embarassed myself. I heard that water aerobics was alot of fun. I had been worried that there would be a lack of night life--not true. There is a show every night--not quite as good as on a cruise but still very enjoyable. And there are singers in the lobby and dancing by all, a discotheque that opens later in the evening, and a small but fun casino. All in all a wonderful vacation--we each read 4 books and relaxed! I wish there had been beachside bar service--next time I would bring a cooler, order a beer delivery to the room, and take that with me. Oh, the air conditioning in the room is one temperature-cold. At night we just turned it off and it was quite comfortable. Ladies, bring lots of bathing suits--bikinis even if you wouldn't be caught dead wearing one at home. There's a fair amount of women going topless. Men need long pants for dinner. Staff speak mostly Spanish so communication can be an issue. You will be 'encouraged' to attend a sales presentation. It does take almost 2 hours and is pretty high pressure to buy this vacation club, but no matter how you decide, you are given a $100 coupon to use in the spa or for parasailing or for shopping as well as a free week where the room only is covered and you are responsible for meals and drink. This was our first all-inclusive and I would definitely recommend this location.

<Content>Not for Americans!! The place looks great but service is extremely lacking! Towels in the room is definitely an ongoing problem. You ask for them over and over, even in Spanish and it takes about 5 inquires before they arrive. Should not have to ask for towels for what you are paying. Think twice about going to the Dominican Republic with your family and kids. Topless sunbathing everywhere. Smoking is encouraged everywhere and if you inqurie about a non-smoking section, they look at you like you're crazy. This destination is geared toward Europeans as a whole. The food is a very big disappointment. Fatty steaks, poor quality poultry and seafood seem to be the norm. The rave reviews I see are in the winter months, but I can see that staying away from this place yearround is my take on it. Cancun, Mexico is a much better fit for families. It cost too much money to fly to the Dominican Republic to have your vacation disapointed with poor service. Service that doesn't have to be poor either. Also, prepare for long waits for the trolly. And when you return from the trolly, prepare to smell like gasoline as the fumes penetrate every piece of clothing on you. Stay away!

<Content>Our second trip back to Paradisus This was our second trip back to Paradisus Punta Cana. We went last year on a girls trip and had so much fun that we decided to take our dad there for his 60th birthday.Last year we stayed in the Delux Junior Suite on the old side of the property. This year we upgraded to the Reserve in the Luxury Junior Suite. The rooms are magnificant. King size beds, jacuzzi tubs, plasma tv's in both the bedroom and the living room. Separate walk in shower and water closet. The mini bar in the living room was restocked every day with sodas and snacks. You can request beer and rum and they will put it in the fridge for when you return to your room. Our concierge Jean was the best. He showed us all the features of the room and was available for any questions we had. The only propblem I had was with the maid service. They are not consistent on the time they clean the room. One night they came to clean as we were heading out to dinner. Also, you have to ask for wash cloths every night because they do not leave any in the rooms.We went during their off season so all of the restaurants were not open every night. We were only able to get a reservation for one night at Vento but the food was excellent. The other nights we ate at the Gabi (a restaurant reserved for only Reserve guests). I have seen reviews where staff is regarded as unfriendly. They are very nice people and will pretty much do anything you ask. When we arrived we had not had a chance to get anything to eat and all of the restaurants were full. Raphael came to our rescue and went into the kitchen and ordered us some chicken tenders and fries. Ronnie was our bartender at the Gabi and he was always very pleasant and ready to serve us. You have to understand that you are visiting a foreign country and you should respect them and their language. We expect people to speak English here in the states so we can't be upset that they don't always understand us in their country.The very best part of our trip was the 3 hour ATV tour. During the tour you get to see a and meet many of the local children, and we also got to go to the natural cave and swim. At the end of the tour you go down on Macao (sp) beach and ride around. My 9 years old son and my father both swam in the natural cave (which I hear was really cold).Anyway, this is one of the best trips I have been on and I would return again and recommend it other travelers who are not so high strung.

<Content>Would not Return We were disappointed at what we saw. The pictures online were totally different. The pictures online are pictures of The Reserve. We were greeted by a Vacation Concierge. The next day we found out what that meant. The day we arrived, we were checked in which was a smooth process, then had to sit in the lobby so the Vacation Concierge can go over a few things with us. Basically to explain how the Restaurants operate. Once that was done, off we went to our rooms. The rooms were okay but definitely not 4, 4 1/2 or 5 star quality. Vacation Concierge tells you to meet him for a 90 minute presentation about the vacation club. The vacation club is The Reserve which is on the other side and is very nice. The Reserve are the pictures you see online. You have to be a member to stay on this side. We all went at different times and were quoted different prices ($56,000, $38,000, etc.). We did receive a $100 voucher for attending. The Restaurants - that was a joke. If you are a member at the Reserve, you are guaranteed a spot. If not a member, reservations go fast and you are stuck with eating at the buffet spot. Trying to get a good meal was a challenge and very frustrating. Perks and headaches - the first night after returning from dinner, we all received a note (except one couple) to pick up vouchers from the front desk. We all received vouchers for wine, dinner at Gabi (which is a very nice restaurant on the Reserve side), spa for 2 and casino vouchers. So the next morning, the ladies went to the front desk to obtain the same vouchers for the couple who did not receive them. They would not give them to us. I had to get real ugly trying to prove they were a part of our group. Luckily I brought the receipt with everyone's name and amount. Once I provided that, they took it in the back then came out realizing they messed up on our spa vouchers. It appears they are only keeping the Paradisus part open so they can trick folks into coming then try and sell them on the Reserve side. We were with a fun group so we made the best out of it and had a great time.

<Content>Beautiful resort with terrible service The grounds of the Paradisus are beautiful and well-maintained.The rooms are adequate and housekeeping was not consistent - some days we got supplies and some days we did not, despite leaving a tip each day.The food ranged from marginal at the steakhouse to good at the Italian and French restaurants.No need to pay additional for royal service. For a small gratuity, we had our own personal concierge who made all our reservations and even accompanied us to the Plaza Bavaro, a shopping village within walking distance but outside the hotel grounds. He also arranged for us to be picked up and dropped off at the side gate for a trip to the casino at the next hotel.We were also granted access to the royal service section of the beach where drinks were delivered regularly. Perhaps because it was off season, but we were able to avail ourselves of many of the perks without paying more.Although we enjoyed our vacation there, the service left much to be desired. Unless you asked multiple times, you did not get what you requested. Sometimes it was lack of communication and sometimes we were just ignored. Either way, it was unacceptable. The club was under renovation but the music and dancing took place in the lobby, which was fine.Having said all that, the single biggest problem, and one that will insure I never return to the DR was the airport.On our previous two trips, the airport was an annoyance, but this trip was unbearable. There was only one (yes, one) security scanner operating for thousands of people. Needless to say, it took hours to get through. The lines snaked around until there was no place left to go at which point, people just began getting on line wherever they wanted, causing huge gridlock. The officials did nothing to help. It was a nightmare.

<Content>Stay Away! We arrived at the Paradisus Punta Cana Resort with high expectations. Last year we stayed at the Paradisus in Rivera Maya Mexico and had a wonderful time. We were three couples. One couple was promised a VIP room and the other two were promised either the same building or one close to it. The first room we were given was horrible. We were all separated and each room had a very horrible smell of cleaning liquids (I think) - certainly not VIP. We moved within an hour into buildings far from the restaurant and beach area. We were supposed to be located close to each. We were then promised we could move the following day closer to the beach. They claimed that they put us on the list for the room change.The day of the change we verified if we were on a list and told yes. Come back at 3 pm and it will be taken care of. Lo and behold we come back and are NOT on the list. It took 2 hours before we could move. The rooms we were given were not adequate nor close to the beach or VIP as promised. After an hour we finally received decent rooms but not before a lot of fighting and arguing.Take note that this hotel does not cater to the American traveler. They DO NOT speak english unless the answer is no or involves money. They are quick to take the all mighty dollar but also very quick to say no. They do cater to the spanish visitor.Pool and BeachBoth the Pool and Beach were wonderful saving the Paradisus a terrible rating. The beach water is clean and blue while the pool even though warm was pretty and large. There were plenty of beach chairs and huts and the same goes for the pool. There were people who left their empty drink cups on the pool edge and even in the pool but the staff did clean up. Towels were supposed to be ready by 8am and were NEVER available until at least 10am. Using your towel card you were only allotted one towel. When we arrived to ask for towels at 8 we were always told uno momento, that is their favorite phrase. They were always lying to the guests. If you asked for additional towels they would say no. We were forced to take dirty towels from their towel bin and returned them for clean towels. This way we were able to accumulate enough cards for the number of towels we needed. They force you into being liars just like they are.Grounds - they are well manicured and niceTransportation - you need a tram to get around. They are not totally reliable. One night we got out of the restaurant area around 11pm and waited 1/2 hour for a tram. I called the office to be told uno momento. After 15 minutes I called again and told another uno momento. I told them we had a medical emergency and they will be sued unless we got a tram immediately - they responded within moments. Again, we were forced to lie.Restaurants - Many restaurants were closed for dinner including 3 nights in a row the Buffet restaurant which should always be opened as a just in case. Most of the open restaurants required reservations which are nearly imposible to get and you are limited to the remaining open restaurants. It was so bad one night that both the seafood and steak restaurant as well as buffet were all closed the same night, giving very little choice as to where to go. The first day at the hotel we booked restuarants including the Fuego twice. We went there only to be told it was closed for the week. We were left with nothing after dressing for dinner. Again lies from the staff. You could never get a straight answer from anyone. The quality of the food was very uneven for the same restaurant. One night the food could be good the next not very good. I would not recommend the Japaneese or Chineese restaurants but would recommend the French (lamb chops), Seafood (very good shrimp appetizer, Steak (tenderloin) and Italian restaurants. However beware of the service. At the seafood restaurant it took over an hour to get my soup. They delivered 5 of the 6 main courses and would have forgotten all about thge last main dish if I did not go back to the kitchen and was forced at yelling at them. Finally, I got some action. They were totally disorganized. At the Italian restaurant, 5 of 6 meals were delivered. Each time I aske about the last meal I was told uno momento. It took 45 minutes for the last meal to arrive. Generally lousy service.Breakfast and lunch buffets were fine (I guess when you serve yourself you have less problems).Housekeeping - I had to call every night for extra towels and the bar to be restocked. Terrible housekeeping. Once when I called for extra towals I was asked how many people in the room and why I needed them - how insulting. Please note that we were told by the beach towel folks to bring our room towels.Our room was bug free but the other two rooms were crawling with ants and nothing was done to stem the ants.Wake up calls - I set the clock to my Verizon phone. Every day the wake up call was 15 minutes late. We asked why and they had the audacity to say they had the correct time. I could go on but the service was terrible. We travel at least once and year and have been doing so for years - this was the worst service I EVER experienced. The staff did not care at all about the guests. Constantly lied to (I went to the Public Relations desk and asked if the US newspapers arrived yet - which are 1 foot from his desk. I was told no. I look and there are the newspapers)They will yes you and do nothing. Unwilling to give on any issue. Its their way or no way.I will never go back to this Paradisus nor recommend it to anyone. There are so many other islands and hotels to choose from that I do not have to accept their treatment. Incidentally, I spoke to MANY other US citizens who interestingly enough had the exact same feelings as me. I would have questioned if it was just me but after speaking with others I knew this was a consistent issue with this hotel.I will not mention names of those who were very uncooperative but there were a couple of employees who were helpful and again saved the rating from being terrible.

<Content>LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT!!! I was extremely worried about staying here from reading the previous reviews. I have never written a review but I feel obligated based on my experience. We checked in at a private check in and served cocktails. Room: Stayed at the Reserve in a junior suite. It is further from the beach but the trams run constantly and the concierge will call them to pick you up. We had a jacuzzi which was very sizable. Nice size living room. Anything that we needed for the minibar we just asked. The first night we stayed in a room facing the side. Asked for a pool view and the next day we were moved (Thanks Jennifer). Beach: Tourqoise blue and beautiful. The waves were rough but nothing dangerous. There was a little seaweed but what can you do. Plenty of bali beds and lounges. There are lots of activities included on the beach, volleyball, catamarans, etc. Many are included. We went parasailing and used ScubaCaribe which is right on the beach. We were in the air only about 10 minutes but it was a good experience. We also took the Sunset Cruise. They take you to a reef snorkeling, pretty nice. Then you go to a natural spring where the water is waist deep. They bring out rum into the ocean and you drink right there. I highly recommend that you take the cruise with Ishmel and Orlando. Ishmel is a live wire and gets the party started. You must do the horsebacking riding. Its included and they take you to a ranch where you ride to a beach. Don't wear your good shoes.Restaurants: The food could be better. We had breakfast at Gabi everyday. It was a pretty nice buffet, good omelets. Vento and Fuego were the best. We went to El Romantico for my birthday and they brought out a big cake which is excellent. I think you do have to pay for the cake (worth it). Staff: I cannot understand why anybody would have a problem with the staff. First of all, you are in a foreign country and you should have respect for the natives. I understand you are on vacation but being nice goes a long way. These people have nothing. If you can afford to stay here, then you can afford to tip $1. Stop being cheap!!!Entertainment: The Michael Jackson show was entertaining. Skip the casino. There is a club (Mangu) down the street that everyone goes to but we didn't. The lobby has a band at nights and everyone joins in, pretty fun. Great pool at the Reserve with a nice grill and swim up bar. Never a problem getting a tiki bed but this is the low season.I have been to several all inclusives throughout the Carribean and Mexico. This tops them all. Trust me if you get to know the staff you will not want to leave. Tell Osirus, Eli, Jean, Juan, Ronny Garcia,  Marcos hello. And you must have a drink called the green Reserve and plenty of mamajuana. If you need anything else feel free to contact me.

<Content>Very Nice, but not Excellent Just returned from a week at the Paradisus. I have been reading the reviews for months now so felt it important to provide my input.Rooms - outdated. Need a face-lift. Bathroom was odd with the saloon doors. Our closet door didn't slide so it was no use to us. Need more drawer space. Not fond of the shower/jacuzzi setup. No bugs to report (thank goodness). Staff cleaned it daily and usually in the AM which was nice.Property - Beautifully landscaped. Clean. Very nice.Trams - readily available Beach - beautiful turquoise water. Would have been nice to have bar service on the beach. Had to walk to the bar (which wasn't far) but the drink was warm by the time you got back to the beach. We had waves at our section of the beach which was great the kids for boogie-boarding and body surfing. Saw topless woman (and no, they are not all over 50 either). After a few pass by, you tend not to notice anymore.Activities - We did the dune buggy. Fun, fun, fun. Wear clothes that you don't mind throwing out or using later for trash clothes. You get pretty dirty on this adventure, but I recommend it. We snorkeld through the hotel. Short time in the water, but the ride out to the reef was beautiful. One thing I suggest you do not do is the whale raft which you'll see going back and forth in the water. Our group went on it and were dumped into the water in minutes. Very angry that it took us time to get back onto the rafe. I ended up swimming back into shore. The rest of the group did it for a while longer and requested to be brought in. Food - Buffet's were good - after a few days you do get tired of it but the variety was good. We were lucky and had the restaurants booked by our conciegure. All were good. Hear that some had trouble getting in.Pool - Very nice, big ... the water was a big warm but what do you expect in humid weather :)Tipping - bring 1's and 5's. They do appreciate the extra tips.Check-In - no problem in checking in or out. Very pleasant.Staff - we inadvertently left our safe key in the safe -- the staff returned the key to the front desk for us to pick up. Everything in the safe (all our money, passports, etc) were all there. The staff person was very honest (and was rewarded by a nice tip).

<Content>Average I relied on reviews from this site immensely before booking so I owe it to others to give my review. We booked 2 connecting rooms for 4 adults and 4 children (1,3,7,11). The first thing I must mention is that we booked in the RESERVE section of the hotel and therefore my opinion is based on accommodations in that section. The RESERVE section is the newer section of the hotel. It is further away from the beach, about a 15 minute walk or a quick golf tram ride, which run by the front of your unit and are fairly constant. We booked 2 Family Concierge rooms. The perks include a concierge that will assist you with pretty much everything including restaurant and activities bookings, special requests, etc. For example, liquor is not included in the room service, but our concierge made sure I had some cognac in my room every evening (at my request). We also got a welcome kit for each one of the kids that included t-shirts, caps, floaties for the pool, sandals, and a few other toys. Also as a RESERVE member you have access to an onsite restaurant (don鈥檛 remember the name) where you can have menu service breakfast in case you don鈥檛 want to go to the buffet. ARRIVAL: Airport is nice and customs/baggage claim was pretty quick and efficient. I recommend you shell out the money for a cab (About $40) and don鈥檛 take the hotel shuttle. This will ensure you don鈥檛 have to wait at the airport and don鈥檛 have to make any stops on the way to your hotel. But more importantly, it lets you arrive earlier than those that were on your flight and also staying at your hotel, creating delays and a line at check-in. ROOMS: The rooms were excellent. All modern appliances/fixtures; comfortable beds; very spacious; nice bathrooms; we were all very happy and impressed and looked forward to going back to our rooms at the end of the day. Housekeeping did a very good job putting the place back in order after the kids made their messes, although they were not consistent on timings. One day it would be at 10AM, the next at 4PM, etc. The room service menu at the resort is one of the best I have seen. Although they had nothing fancy, they did offer steak and shrimp dishes, in addition to the usual burgers, pizza, and sandwiches (24 hours by the way). The fridge in your room does not get automatically restocked; you have to ask for it.FOOD: Food was good in the Buffets, nothing outstanding. They need a little more variety. After about the 4th day we were already tired of it. The restaurants for the most part were good, although the wait times to get your order were ridiculous (sometimes 45+ minutes). We did not have any problem getting into any of the restaurants but that was because were had the concierge service. He took care of all our reservations for the entire week. We saw quite a few people get turned away because either they arrived late or did not have reservations. With the exception of the GABI restaurant in the Reserve section, all restaurants are in the open so it is hot.LIQUOR: The liquor selection was decent; if you drink Cognac they have Remy Martin, They also have JWBlack, JD, top shelf Vodkas and other good selections. They also have premium liquors such as Johnny Walker Blue and Hennessy XO, but they are not included in the all-inclusive and you have to purchase the entire bottle at about 250 to 300 a bottle. They have a wide variety of tropical drinks. BEACH: The beach was outstanding, with minimal seaweed, turquoise warm water, and white sands. As a RESERVE member you have access to an exclusive section of the beach and therefore we never had any trouble finding empty palapas (giant straw umbrellas) or a spot on the beach. The best part of this section was the food service; we were able to order snacks like burgers, hotdogs, sandwiches and pizza and have them brought to us right on the beach (alcoholic drinks also). This was very convenient since it would have been a hassle to leave the comforts of the beach and have to pick up and go to the buffet when we got hungry. Be advised that there are many topless women walking by and laying on the beach in this area.POOLS: Pools were very nice and large, with convenient swim-up bars. The RESERVE section has a separate pool for its members and a special kiddie pool that is pretty nice.ENTERTAINMENT: If you have been to a resort before, then don鈥檛 expect anything different from the nightly shows you have probably seen. If not, then just think high school type performances, including the Michael Jackson show which seems to be a standard at every damn resort. On one night, a show took place on the beach where they had your fire-eater, and other 鈥渙dd鈥?type performances, also included were female dancers on elevated stands. Pretty nice show and a nice break from the usual stage performances. We only went to the nightclub once and to my surprise it was pretty good. A good balance of the sexes, good music and friendly service.  SHOPPING: There are several shopping areas nearby, just a short cab ride away. Regardless of where you go however, unless you are with a local, be prepared to be overcharged. There are opportunities to get good deals though. I picked up an oil painting for $100. When I took it to a shop in NYC to get it framed, the owner told me he could sell the painting for $2,500. The only problem I saw with this hotel was the attitude of the check-in staff. These people act as if they are doing you a favor by checking you in. The rest of the staff however were very friendly and helpful. The time share pitch pretty much stopped after we firmly told them we were not interested. If you can afford it, and don鈥檛 mind not being on the beach, I would highly recommend the RESERVE area/Concierge Service (Royal Service if you have no kids). Having someone to make all your reservations and book all your activities really makes a difference and avoids much aggravation. Not to mention the fact that they will assist you with any special requests. They issue you a cell phone so that you may contact your assigned concierge directly at any time for your needs. Overall we had a good experience at the resort. If not for the bad attitude of the check-in staff, and the fact that I congratulated a lady for her expectant child, but then turned out not to be pregnant, the trip would have been above average.

<Content>Graduation Trip Just returned from trip with about 40 people, combination of recent high school graduates and parents. Overall, the group was pleased. Put 2-3 kids in regular rooms and parents stayed in Royal Service. Didn't see any Reserve rooms, but since I am a beach person, even if the rooms are newer and nicer, they are too far from the beach. There did appear to be a lot of fun slides and water toys at the Reserves pool for younger children. Regular rooms and Royal Service rooms seem to be same size. Royal Service had larger flat screen tv and chaise lounge and are much closer to the beach. Agree with others' opinions that bathroom door set up is a bit weird (swinging doors) and having to step up and over into tub to take shower is not ideal. Room was very clean, but some of furniture and tile/grout around tub could use updating. Our room was never made up until 3 at the earliest each day. I like to come back mid day and see the bed made with clean towels. Don't know if that is the norm or just where we were in the rotation. I did have to call to ask that it be made up several times. We had no bug issues in the room (although one person in the group did have a cockroach in her room) nor with mosquitos at night outside. Never used bug spray that I had brought with me.Royal Service - Not sure worth the extra money, but it was nice. Check in separate location. Much more civilized than checking the kids in. Supplied with cold washcloth, glass of champagne and seated in airconditioned room. We ate breakfast there most mornings and it was quite pleasant. Also able to use 3 computers there to check emails from home. They have tea time 4-6 and hors d'oeuvres 6-8. Nice idea, but nothing special food-wise. Separate pool is very nice and has a small pool bar and lots of seating around it. There is a section of beach roped off. Same sand, same thatched umbrellas, basically same lounge chairs as regular beach. Never had any trouble getting beach space. Didn't see any lounge chairs in bad shape. Lots of double mattress type lounges that were most comfortable. There was drink service on the beach and he came around very regularly. Not sure if room service was any different for Royal Service. Nice to use for snacks such as cheese plate, shrimp cocktail, club sandwich. Never really used for meals, although one mom ordered steak and said it was delicious. Outdoors - Landscaping is lovely and staff is constantly working on the gardens and plants. The beach is very large and, for me, fine white sand is a big positive. There was a delightful breeze the 6 days we were there, but did make the water a bit choppy. Ocean was fun to swim in, small waves, just cool enough to be refreshing. Nice to walk along and lots of people beach walk.Activities - Used the gym everyday. Might get crowded in high season, but fine for this time of year. Decent equipment. Nice attendant who supplied hand towels and water bottles readily. Husband went horseback riding and said it was lots of fun. Took snorkeling trip which wasn't bad, saw decent variety of fish. However, staff on that trip was less than helpful. We took catamaran out sailing which was fun. Rode a basic bike one afternoon, best way to see the whole place. Walking from one end to the other is far, but good to work off the extra calories. Stopped in to two shows. Nothing special, energetic group of dancers. Band in lobby bar area was lively and got people up dancing. Kids spent time in nightclub which was more their music while lobby band was more island music. All of the above were included. Casino was small but fun and had opportunities for novices and not big spenders to participate. People who had massage at spa and/or at beach said they were good, slightly more expensive than home.Vacation club/timeshare - Never approached to take tour.Restaurants - Probably the biggest problem. The reservation system is frustrating. Best advice would be as soon as possible, day of arrival if before 3, or next morning, to get the schedule of what's open on various nights and book all your dinners for your stay. Otherwise it's a hassle. I tried to book in advance because I was trying to book for 15. They would not allow me to do so, but I did email them in advance and it did work out. The consensus of our group of adults was that Gabi's, Vento and El Romantico were the best. None top notch, but very good. Japanese was only open one night and we couldn't get in. Italian was okay, sea bass actually quite good. Decided to go to steak place last night (doesn't take reservations) and besides having to wait long time, that was probably our worst meal. The places that don't require reservations often have very long waits unless you are a small group eating early. The buffet lunch had a great deal of variety, not all of super quality, but there were always enough things that were decent. Only the deserts were uniformly poor in every restaurant for every meal. They often looked pretty, but had no flavor. Drinks were generally good. Had trouble with white wine, no chardonnay or pinot grigio. Most times had to ask to sample whatevery they were serving (never had more than 2 to choose from) to see which one was dry. Kids enjoyed the Chinese restaurant and El Marino for seafood. Paid $30 each way (plus tip) for transportation to airport We arranged for taxi in advance so don't know how it works if hotel does it for you. Call early to have your bags picked up from your room. Waited almost 1/2 hour. Punta Cana airport was quite busy. Bags are checked initially, then you check in with airline, then customs and then security, each with its own line. So don't cut it short. With a group like ours, all inclusive was the only way to go. Kids and parents had fun and all came back in one piece! Haven't been to Dominican Republic before or all inclusive, so no basis for comparison, but overall we enjoyed Paradisus.

<Content>Hotel Committed Fraud? We stayed at Club Med for a week. Then on the day of our departure our plane broke down - requiring us to stay an extra day in Punta Cana. We stayed at the Paradisus - as it was the first hotel we found where we could stay one night.We stayed there one night and departed the next day. When my credit card statement came - I found they charged me for 1 additional week - even though we didn't stay there! Total of $1,973.93. I disputed the charge and they sent a reciept for 1 week of stay!

<Content>Needs work to be a 4 or 5 star. First time stay in June recommended by a friend with (supposedly) good taste for the high life. Stayed in a Garden Suite. Bathroom does not have a door, they have saloon doors. A one person jacuzzi is also the shower squeezed in with the toilet. Mold around the back part of tub since the water from shower falls and doesn't drain. Mold spots on the shower curtain. Mosquitoes bit me every night, even with OFF!! purchased for $15 US at their store. Beds are hard, no washclothes and maid forgot to give us handtowels two days in a row or fill the tissue box. 10 restaurants yes, but only 4 or 5 are open every day and you are required to make reservations with your assigned concierge every morning, fingers crossed that the system is workning and not slow. Formal wear is required for some restaurants (pants, collar shirts for men). Lunch and breafast are decent buffets. Some restaurants are much better than others, most of the food is bland. They lack spice or look full of flavor but not really. Staff barely smile and seem happy. They are horrible horrible in bringing you drinks, even water, during the buffets. I saw staff every where, but not when I needed a drink, or a spoon. I see the congregate and chat. Never saw any supervisor. Sand is very fine and gets every where! Absolutely NO beverage service on the beach which - in my opinion - removes a star. A lot of lounge chairs are broken due to fat people plotting their asses too hard on the fabric. Metal on chair is too hot to place your arms on the arm rest. Ok to go topless on beach but not observed at pool. Pool is nice and calm with lots of shady areas, but too shallow for it to be cool when it was 90 or 85 out with 100% humidity. Spa is ok. Locker room is VERY small. The hotel uses a combo of golf carts and gas golf Cars to tote you back and forth from the lobby and beach. They claim to be eco friendly but not really if they use disel or cas cars for inner transport. I would not go again and I would not recommend. I went for rest and relaxation. For two days I had convention people encroaching on my beach peace. I did enjoy the beach and pool and it was nice to have food variety included.

<Content>Worth every penny First I have to start by saying I was very scared after reading some of the reviews on this site. I booked this trip on a whim, and was horrified by some of the things I heard. While everyone's tastes are different as well as experiences....I can only give you mine.The resort is wonderful. It is huge, and at first can be a little overwhelming. It does take a day or two to get the hang of it, such as where the restaurants are... things are quite scattered around the resort ground but they provide transportation and you never have to wait too long.Ok, THE ROOM. Mine was clean; it was nice, not great but good enough. I stayed in a junior suite which is considered a regular room. I was able to get towels when I needed them.The FOOD. This is confusing because not all of the restaurants were open. The resort was only at about 30 percent capacity, so it's understandable. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. I am Italian, so naturally I didn't expect the Italian food to be like what mama makes.... so I stuck to rice and beans and Dominican dishes which is what they do best.The hotel staff was nice, yeah, you have a few that can鈥檛 be bothered helping you, but that鈥檚 anywhere.The majority of them really went out of their way for us. We took a bunch of singles and 5 dollar bills. You don鈥檛 have to, but we tipped. It is a poor country they only make about 200 US dollars a month! And the people are appreciative when you tip them.THE BEACH was beautiful....water was warm, sand was white no complaints!!!!! Wish I was there.Ok here are some tips for you.MAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS FOR DINNER AS SOON AS YOU EAT BREAKFAST!!!! THE RESERVATION CENTER FOR THE RESTARAUNTS IS LOCATED IN THE HIBISCUS LOUNGE, SAME PLACE YOU'LL EAT BREAKFAST.THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET YOU TO JOIN SOME KIND OF VACATION CLUB. IT鈥橲 SOME SORT OF TIME SHARE (they say its not, but it is) AND THEY WILL ASK FOR 90 MINUTES OF YOUR TIME. THEY WILL GIVE YOU A FREE GIFT, BUT I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED SO MY BOYFRIEND AND I JUST SAID NO.....FIRMLY.BRING BUGSPRAY. LOOK, IT IS A TROPICAL ISLAND, AND THERE ARE MOSQUITOS. BUT THERE ARE MOSQUITOS EVERY WHERE, SO WHATS THE BIG DEAL.THE SUN IS STRONG, WEAR SUNBLOCK AND DRINK WATER!ALSO, JUST TO BE SAFE, I TOOK 2 PEPTO BISMOL TABLETS AS SOON AS I WOKE UP EVERY MORNING. I DIDNT GET SICK, NOT AT ALL.AND YES, IT IS HELPFUL IF YOUSPEAK SOME SPANISH, BUT IF NOT, A LOT OF THE HOTEL STAFF SPEAK ENGLISH.We had a great time, don鈥檛 worry about a thing. Would go back in a heart beat!

<Content>B+ Value for the money, we would visti again We would return to Paradisus as the good outweighs the bad and, as returning guests, the knowledge gained from a prior visit would make for a more enjoyable return stay.The Beach -- Soft white sand, very wide, gentle surf, absolutely world class. Plenty of chairs as well as abundant shelter from the sun available. [A+]Water Sports -- Sailing, kayaking, scuba. One free scuba dive per day, resort supplies all equipment. Divemasters were great. [B+]Food -- Breakfast and lunch buffets were always very good. Lots of fresh fruit and many, varied choices of food. Dinner selections varied from inedible (no exaggeration) to very good in the same restaurant on the same night. This is where experience comes in; at Albufera order the tenderloin not the sirloin. Fuego was the standout with excellent food and outstanding service. Bottled water and other drinks always readily available. [Breakfast = A, Lunch = B, Dinner = ya never know could be an A could be an F]Staff -- generally helpful, but not overly so. Overall a B- to C+. In the restaurants if the manager was friendly/guest-oriented so was the staff. If the manager was surly (and some were), well...Rooms -- not bad but not great. Everything worked, quiet, comfortable beds, but showing some wear and tear. Not likely you will spend much time there, however. [B-]Fitness Center -- small, but top of the line LifeFitness equipment. [B+]Transportation -- resort is large and shuttles were readily available to get you around. [B+]Casino -- small and pretty laid back. [B]Security -- use the safe in your room or, better yet, the safe deposit boxes in the lobby. The resort may have a theft problem as cash appears to have gone missing on several ocassions from several of the rooms occupied by our group. [D-]Punta Cana Airport -- Updated, nice and efficient. One of the easier ins/outs we've had in the caribbean. [A]Overall value for the money is a B+. Consistent and better dinner would make a huge difference as would updated rooms. The resort does not knock your sox off like The Ritz -- Cancun, for example, but the cost is also in a different stratosphere. Paradisus is very comparable to Moon Palace -- Cancun or Swept Away -- Negril, Jamaica.So, again, we'd go back for the killer beach and now that we know what restaurants and foods to avoid. Next time would probably try staying on The Reserve side of the resort to see if it's worth the extra $$$s.

<Content>Beautiful Resort I am going to begin this review by explaining that I was very very critical, I am planning a destination wedding to Punta Cana and this was a planning trip. The resort is huge and the grounds are beautiful. We were there in the off season and the resort was only 30% occupied. Check in was a breeze, our room was ready and we were on the beach within 30 minutes of our arrival. The room was ok, I reccomend asking for a renovated one-just fresher but basically the same as the older ones. Royal Service rooms were very nice, almost the same as ours but just a little more modern with plasma tvs and marble floors. The best part about Royal Service is that most of it is on the beach and their own pool with bali beds in it. We didn't really do any of the activites from the resort but there were a lot offered. They say there are activites at night but we didn't see any and were fine just laying in a bali bed on the beach or by the pool. We had no problems finding chairs on the beach or by the pool and spent the days going back and forth between them. The beach and ocean are beautiful (our wedding pics will be gorgeous against the Punta Cana back drop). The pool was huge and there were plenty of areas to sit and relax in the pool, around the pool, or hang out by the pool bar. It did rain (by rain, I mean pour) for a day and 1/2 but there is no predicting the weather and that can happen anywhere, anytime. We did a dune buggy excusion but it was raining and I hated it--it would be fun in the nice weather. We did the whole tour and wedding thing and they are about the same as everyone else. We had a few negatives 1) the resort is huge and will be very difficult for my 80+ year old guests to get around and it is not at all handicap friendly 2) we really didn't like the food and we are very open minded. Everything we ate was salty and tasted fishy. I was disapponted that the seafood didn't seem to be that fresh or cooked well. We did not get sick we just didn't enjoy it. Everyone there is so nice and always willing to help. Take a stack of 1's and you will be suprised how much they get you. It is not necessarily the best place for our wedding group but a girls weekend or a getaway would be great there. We did go to the Palma Real to visit and fell in love with it. It's a totally different feel. The Punta Cana was very islandy with caribbean music, lush landscaping and lots of energy while the Palma Real is much more serene, much smaller, and takes your breath away as soon as you walk into the lobby. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

<Content>Great Family Trip We just returned from the Paradisus Punta Cana, we stayed for 5 nights in the base room they offer. We enjoyed the entire trip, we had no problems with the hotel of it's staff. Everyone we met was friendly and very helpful. My husband, daughter (8 years old), and myself speak no spanish, but everyone worked very hard to understand what we needed. Daughter enjoyed the Kids Club, pool, and beach. Husband and I enjoyed the included scuba diving. We had no problems making reservation, although all of the resturants weren't open since this was not a peak time for the resort. Also, bring bug spray, most of the resort is open air and mosiquitos come out at night! The Reserve Area is VERY nice, if we return to the resort without our daughter we'll upgrade for the extra amenities they offer.

<Content>wish we could have loved it, but... We received a Travelzoo special deal on Paradisus for a package price with a guaranteed upgrae at the hotel. We booked it and pre-paid on the hotel web site (they're part of Sol Melia) and asked the hotel for help with booking transfers. We received the confirmation of the transfers from Karina Rijo at Sol, but when we arrived there was nobody waiting and we couldn'teven find the transfer company she referred us to. We got a cab.Once at the resort, we tried to check in with Lourdes at the front desk. She had a reservation for us but had no record of the upgrade. She didn't even have a record of the payment, though she did have a booking. After nearl 80 minutes at the front desk, we finally paid the booking again and took the lower grade room. Unfortunately, we found that we'd been at the front desk so long that we'd missed the opportunity to book a reservation at one of the better restaurants at the facility, so we figured we'd just chill and have dinner at one of the buffets.Dinner is a funny thing at Paradisus. There are a number of restaurants at the resort, some of which are open and some of which are closed on any given day. The schedule says you have to make reservations between 8.30 and 3pm each day for the following day, but the reality is that if you show up after 9am you're ou of luck. The good restaurants fill up within minutes (they have a premium reservation package for an extra fee and I suspect those people get first crack at the good tables) so get there early. On the first day we went to one of the two restaurants that didn't require advance reservations and were told (at 8.30) that the wait was about an hour. We went to the other one and, again, the wat was about an hour. Curiously, we found that the better restaurants that required bookings were, according to the staff booked to capacity but the rooms were only about half full. When we finally did get into one of the restaurants, we noticed that, again, the good restaurants were still only about half full. and when we left 45 minutes later the tables were--you guessed it--about half full. On the second day the story with the restaurants played out about the same, except that we tried going earlier--about 7pm. Again, the better restaurants wouldn't seat us because they were full to capacity and the others had a 60-minute wait. A friend in the hotel business said that some resort operators deliberately keep the number of bookings at the better restaurants way below capacity to save money and channel people into the lower cost places. But if you're getting lines of an hour, is that a reasonable course of action?It migh have been worth it if the food had been good, but it wasn't. They might have a focus on lowest common denominator, but I've never seen such beautifully arranged and presented food that was so incredibly bland. Devoid of flavor, dead, vapid. Contrast that with the bar, which was stocked with lots of top shelf alcohol up front--for display only, though. I saw the drinks were actually mixed with no-name bottles below the view unlss you specifically asked for it to be made from one of the good bottles and watched the barkeep make the drink.One thing that was great at this resort is the beach and the grounds. Whoever manages the grounds deserves a medal. the housekeeping staff and groundskeepers are wonderful and the surroundings are lush and beautiful.We really wanted to love this place but couldn't. The beautiful grounds couldn't make up for the terrible management. We won't be back, and I don't think we'd go back to a Sol Melia place either. I'm sure the locals take their cue from the Sol management.

<Content>TROPICAL BLISS /service oriented, nearly perfect w/only one flaw Wow! This is the most lush tropical feeling resort I've been to yet! Beautiful grounds! Most gorgeous Beach as well. and I'm a Beach fanatic! I EVEN used the pool a bit every day because the pool here had many private 'enclaves' of lush tropical gardens and beds scattered about....Felt like you were in Eden.....IT was a VERY romantic anniversary trip....sigh.....I wanted to stay longer. The maid service and guest services were wonderful! WE received Champagne in the room with a plate of fruit for our anniversary. (I did call them and let them know that we would be celebrating the last night of our trip, and they happily sent over the champagne and fruit) The morning of our last day, I also left a note with a few dollars to our maid in as good of Spanish as I could muster, telling her we were celebrating 26 yrs that day, and would she mind leaving us some flowers. WOW , she made 2 beautiful swans out of the HUGE oversized towels (which by the way----this is first time Ive ever enjoyed the softness and huge size of the towels at an all inclusive) and she had placed flowers around the swans (as well as in our bathroom) with Feliz Anniversario written in a floral display. So of course upon departure, I thanked her with another note and tip for going the extra mile for us....WE did not receive Royal Services because we had booked a standard room, but they DID put us in a building near beach in Royal Service building, so maybe that's why towels were so big, and we had robes in the closet and had jacuzzi tub in bathroom.....The room was multi level with sitting area and chaise lounge and canopy type king bed....VERy nice. although we had weird saloon type doors going into tub and toilet area that didn't seem to fit rest of the decor.....I also called El Romantico where we had our last night dinner, and they put flower petals on the table with another bottle of champagne.......Great filet there...We had lost our camera the night before, and guest relations tracked it down for us, and we got it back...we had left it in restaurant the night before....boy was I impressed with that! We were fortunate.The ONLY reason I could not mark Excellent for this resort was because their reservation system upon arrival made me crazy and the next day....I'll get my one whine out of the way .....It did seem a racket that the so called concierge that greeted us after we checked in, let us know the outlay of the resort,(couldn't get us into any restaurant that night, they were either closed or full) then told us that the next day we were to visit him at the desk in the Buffet Hybiscus for the sheet of resort activities and for him to make dinner reservations for us the 3 remaining nights of our stay. I thought it was a service....well, it was service with a catch....I chatted with some ladies on the beach before breakfast and they warned me about the 90 min presentation which was actually much longer they said, and the price of the vacation membership was exhorbitant. We were only there 4 nights, I didn't want to sit in any presentations even if it was in exchange for dinner reservation services.....wHat our concierge really wanted was to have us listen to this presentation (so he could get his points) in exchange for services, spa treatment, Gabi dinner, etc...... and these folks were at this desk as you entered buffet for breakfast every morning trying to stop you and give you a spa certificate or excursion or something for taking time to listen. IT seemed if you had one of these guys help you make your dinner reservations, your chances of getting in to the ala cartes would be greater.That's not my definition of a REAL Concierge of a hotel property. It should be service only, not service with a catch.....I saw this at the OCean Coral and Turquesa by H10 in Riviera Maya too when I went in March......it just doesn't seem right to call yourself a concierge . ANyway, Since we did not have Royal Service, (or go to the presentation)it was nearly impossible to get into any ala carte I had looked into ahead of time. Out of all the ala cartes that I had wanted to try; (and didn't care to go to the AMerican STeakhouse----as I can get that here in the states)....I wanted to try at least 3 of the others -----either Japanese, Brazilian,Fuego,Vento,Gabi and El Romantico.....they only offered us the Steak House one night and El Romantico had 2 slots left the last night of our trip,and it was late at 9 or 930 pm. I just didn't appreciate that getting into a restaurant at least partially seemed to hinge upon our being affiliated with a concierge person that actually wasn't a real concierge at all, but a member of a sales team wanting to sell vacation time shares.....PLUS, I was on vacation and didn't want to have to keep checking back and hassling w/ reservations in order to get into ala cartes of choice.Dinner reservations was truly a frustration , and for as luxury and service oriented the rest of the resort was, that part didn't fit the rest of the ambiance. And makes me tenous about going back.Anticipating that we would only have 4 nights to even try some of the ala cartes, I even called ahead twice to try to reserve and even emailed (didn't get response from emails) ahead of our vacation , but they would not take my reservations until I was in house. So when we arrived at 1pm on that wed, I asked right away, and the concierge said everything for that night was full, then with only 3 nights left after that, our choices were extremely limited. I also witnessed a couple the very next day VERY frustrated that they couldn't get in either their preferred restaurant for their entire stay cause it was either closed or full.......ENough on that subject, The beauty of surroundings, beach and accommodations were romantic and perfect for us.

<Content>Good but no paradisus A good all-inclusive but with a few drawbacks. I spent three nights with my wife and one-year old child in Paradisus Punta Cana this May.Overall it was a good experience, but I think that so much more could be done to make this an unforgettable place.The good: excellent location, landscaping, beach, pool, bar, staff courtesy to us and the baby (I speak Spanish well, though).The bad: the room A/C was not very strong, the bathtub would not flush at all, on arrival we had no soap or toiletries or pillow covers; the food was good at best (the only very good restaurant was Vento); evening restaurant reservations are impossible to make unless you get here a week before.I did not see other hotels in the area (there are over 40 all jammed on near the other), and I liked the place overall but was not impressed.

<Content>My first trip to punta cana This is a Beautiful and Immaculate resort, Food was excellentand the restaurants we visit Fuego, Vento, Romantic, the Italianall superb .We booked the Royal Service which allowed us to visit all theSwimming Pools. The Royal Service Breakfast restaurantwas a pleasure to go to in the mornings the service impeccable.This is my first experience with an all inclusive and I believethat from now on, by comparison the Paradisus will putthe other to shame.The beach was clean and the water clear, the only problemfor me was that because of the wind is was moving more thanI like. Not everything can be perfect.Yes, I will be back, now between Cayman and St Maarten I haveto included the Paradisus Punta Cana.

<Content>Wonderful Getaway Paradisus was a wonderful getaway for me and my wife. We had time for a short getaway (5 days) from the kids and we wanted something with a great beach, great pool and good food. We found it here. Originally, we read the reviews and saw quite a mix. The selling point was when I found two people who had been there and they only had good things to say. We couldn't agree more. Only one area of concern and I'll discuss that later.  Airport: We flew Continental nonstop from NJ. Flight was fine. Airport exit was fast and uneventful. Paid the $10 per person entry fee (had exact change as stated in the reviews.) Many countries in Caribbean charge a fee. And if this is a sore point after spending thousands of dollars on a trip, then one shouldn't venture out of the United States. By the way, this is less than the tolls I pay to travel into Manhattan every day. Our package included transfers. Baggage handlers only take your bags 100 feet to the curb where the transfer agents take over.  Drive to Resort: We were one of four couples on our van. Everyone was taking a break from the kids. All were from NJ and had been on our plane, so we had a nice chat and hardly noticed the 30 to 40 minute drive. The ride should have taken 20 minutes, but we stopped to drop the other couples off along the way and we were the last couple dropped off. Check In: We arrived at our hotel a few minutes after the 3pm check in time, so our check in was fast and our room was ready. I did observe another couple come back to the desk to ask if their room was ready yet. But obviously, they were there prior to the stated check in time. You were given a bracelet to wear showing you were a guest of the hotel, able to eat, drink and use the facilities.  Transportation around resort: This is a big resort. Transportation is provided by tram or golf cart that routinely drive around the grounds. However, you can hitch a ride with almost any staff riding by in their golf carts. Best accomodations are by the beach because you'll be central to everything except the lobby and one restaurant.  Accommodations: Fortunately, we had a room by the beach. The room was spacious and clean. It had a tile floor that is similar to those of other island resorts. As requested we had a king bed and there was a step down living room area with a refrigerator stocked with soda and bottled water. It is highly recommended that you only drink bottle water and we even use it to brush our teeth. They will stock the frig with whatever you want. The frig didn't seem to be that cold, but it did keep the soda and water cool. But ice was always available. We were on the ground floor and the balcony was still private (surrounded by grass and bushes and trees.) Television was adequate with local US stations. A radio alarm clock was available, but we called for wake up service. Bathroom had a jacuzzi, but I don't take baths in rooms like that. Surprisingly, NO BUGS were seen in our room. Most outdoor villas like that in the tropics do have an occassional bug. A few misqitos here and there, but no noticible bites on either of us.  Pool: Huge, tropical and pretty. Swim up bar always busy, but no waits for drinks. Ask a gardener to cut you a coconut and he'll pull it right off a tree and cut the top off. Get a straw and you're in business. It is nice to throw him a couple of bucks to do that.  Beach: Very nice.... central to other hotels and you can walk up and down beach. Water was great, beach pretty. Never a problem getting a chaise lounge. There is a roped off adults only bar, beach section, and pool, but you are supposed to pay extra for it. We had no problem sitting in that pool or beach even though we didn't have the proper bracelet for that area. Honestly, it wouldn't of mattered what area we sat in. It was all very nice and you could find your own little spot. We did move around to the large pool and to the adult pool.  Food: Very good. No complaints. Breakfast was the typical buffet with local dishes and US dishes. Eggs and omletts to order. Lunch was buffet style with a good selection at both locations, as well as a hamburger and hot dog stand. Dinner buffets were good with menus changing daily. Specialty restaurants were very good. Needed reservations for three of them. You make reservations during the day. I suggest you make all your reservations on day one or two. French Restaurant was very good. Steak restaurant was okay.... (I eat at the best steak houses in NY regularly.) Other restaurant requiring reservations was Japanese. We didn't eat there, but heard it was very good. Sure smelled great. Chinese restaurant required no reservation and was very good. Drinks were great. It felt great not having to carry a wallet or money. Just wearing the bracelet was enough. And don't forget the 24 hour room service. Always faster than they said. A nice shrimp cocktail and fruit platter was ordered every night. Along with champagne on ice. Night life: Small casino in lobby. It ain't vegas. Dancing and shows nightly in an open area off the lobby. Almost all Latin music. I would have liked some US dance music. Walking on beach was nice, but I stayed right in front of the resort. I wouln't stray too far....from property. Just being cautious. It was just as romantic sitting by pool at night.  One sore point: This is all my fault... dum me had to take my lap top. This required going to the lobby wireless area, taking time from the beach. But first you had to go to the business office. This was slow and employees didn't work fast. Wasted too much time there. Rented a phone that took unlimited calls from US for $10 a day, but had to go back to room to get credit card for security... this office is not part of the hotel. Employees here spoke little english and worked slowly. Wasted my time away from the beach. Next time, no computer. If I must, just pay and use there's at night. Overall: Great time. Employees friendly and helpful. Not a lot speak English well, but waiters do. I found two guys who spoke English well and if I needed something, I saw them. At end of trip, I gave some employees I liked a few bucks. Don't forget you are in an impoverished country and a few dollars to the locals make a difference in their lives. Any questions, feel free to contact me.

<Content>Our 2nd trip to Paradisus This was our 2nd time at Paradisus and our 10 year wedding anniversary. We went to RIU a few years ago and decided we really wanted to go back to Paradisus (we were there in 2001). Let me start by saying, we've been to the Bahamas and the Caymen Islands and this hotel is one of the most beautifully landscaped hotels. The pool is gorgeous and there are plenty of areas to get away. Tucked away nooks all over the place. The people are unbelievably friendly and are happy you are there. No question there is a language barrier, but we are in their country after all. So here are some quick tips, good things and disappointments. 1. When you arrive at the airport there are porters who will swarm you to get your bags. You can let them take the bags, but they only carry them a few feet and then want a tip. They'll do the same thing when you return to the airport from the hotel. Next time, I'll insist we can carry our own bags those few feet.2. The last 2 times we've been to Punta Cana, we've taken Pepto tablets with us. I'd take one every morning just to be safe and never had any problems. This time I forgot to bring them (and the antacid). We were there for a 8 days and by day 7 we both got the Montazuma-it has been 2 days and we are both still feeling the side affects! My advice...take antacid tablets-I got bad heartburn one day and also take a pepto tablet every morning even if you feel alright.3. I got great advice from another reviewer to bring chill cups with you to fill up on drinks. I got some migo plastic chill cups with straws at Target and it made for fewer trips between the beach and the bars!4. Bring your own cork screw. We ordered a bottle of wine for the room before heading out to the beach. The wine was there when we returned, but no cork screw. When room service got there, we were in the shower and they didn't leave one so we had to call again. By the time they got there, we were heading out the door for dinner.5. The pillows were flat as pancakes. I would pack an extra bag and bring my own pillow next time.6. Our friends stayed at the resort too and complained of the mosquitos and the room feeling damp. They were in buidling 13 and we were in building 26 (close to the beach). We didn't have the room dampness problem, but the morning we left, my husband woke up with about 30 bites on his elbow from the night. I slept in a long sleeve shirt and was free from the attack!7. Tipping is totally optional and we were treated just as well regardless of whether we tipped or not. We told the staff it was our anniversary and that we had been to the resort before. There were flowers in our room every day and when I saw the cleaning lady in the middle of the week, we gave her $5. We also tipped the bell boy who helped us with our bags at the hotel.8. Bring snacks with you. The only snacks are peanuts and pizza. The pizza is great, but after a few days, it doesn't do the job. We packed some snacks for our room for after the beach and before dinner.9. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us. There is a new place to dine called Fuego-I don't recommend this one. We were there twice-not by choice and the food was not good, and you could tell the service staff were still green. We probably had 5 waiters approach us a and never knew who was our waiter. Also, Sakura, the Japanese restaurant has the best food (in our opinion) and the concierge told us even though we were staying for a week, he couldn't get us in. I pushed him hard on this and suddenly he found a way to get us in...hmmm. It is strange---they told us it would be difficult to get into several restaurants, but when we got there they were only about 1/4 full the entire meal!10. The Italian restaraunt is great for late night pizza and bottles of wine. I found the white wine to be very dry. The red was decent and they will let you take it back to your room with no problem.11. The orange juice is delicious and we all enjoyed the mixture of oj and pineapple juice in the mornings. Omelettes were good too.

<Content>over rated Upon 1st sight, this place is incredible . Great beach, pool, pool bar, lots of places to eat and well maintained grounds. Thats about all it has going for it. We had so many problems it just wasn't a pleasent time..Problem 1: We went to this hotel as part of a 40 person party ages ranging from barely 18 to 60. Our group reserved the trip 6 months in advance and they put us in rooms scattered all over the resort instead of one general area. Since the hotel was almost full we could not change rooms. Problem 2: The rooms are ok, nothing special. Tile floors, 2 beds, bath and a step down sitting area . : We had approx 22 rooms total. All but 3 had issues with bugs. We would wake up covered in welts. One girl look like she had chicken pox after one night!!!!!!!!! Another rooms bathroom floor drain backed up after a rain storm. Flooding the room with human waste( which the staff never totally cleaned up) The staff were indifferent to any room issues we had and were in no hurry to correct any problems Out of space next review will be on the food!!!Nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Excellent- Just got married at the resort I want to start my review with saying that I have spent the last 8-10 months on this sight reading reviews of the Paradisus Punta Cana. Some days I was scared and other days I was happy. I decided in August to plan a wedding at this resort. It came highly recommended by 2 different travel agents. With that being said- THEY WERE RIght!! The Wedding People, the resort , and royal service was TOP notch!!!The Wedding coordinator was fantastic- every detail I emailed her was done. Everything I brought down was decorated as if I did it myself. They were perfect!!! The restaurant for our reception was great  the DJ and firedancers- perfect!!!All our guests booked royal service but 2- Royal service restaurant for breakfest is the way to go. Its inside and quiet- the buffet was a mess!!! Two thumbs up for the royal service restaurant- we ate breakfest everyday and sometimes lunch.The restaurants that required reservations we had no problems. I booked for 24 people for 3 nights with not a single problem. Food and service was better than any of the 4 other allinclusive resorts we stayed before in Mexico and jamica.Royal service pool and beach- people ere asked to leave my entire stay. I saw the patriot cheerleaders asked to leave because they werent royal service.The grounds are great- my wedding pictures are unbelievable. This is one of the nicest places. I did get bite from mosquitos my first 2 days but out of 8 people. They only bite me!!! Crazy- but always went running outside along the eco park. This resort or should I say any resort that is an all-inclusive is not the Ritz carlton in the USA- We have stayed in many all incusive and this is one of the nicest. Also out of 24 people- not 1 person is sick..

<Content>sleep late and still find room under a straw hut,beautiful resort I found the Hotel inside and outside beautiful.check in took 15 min. theres no question that the workers work very hard and deserve tips.I strongly recomend tipping.From bell boy to check in to maid and if not to drunk bartender,just kidding .I found I was put in bungalow 10,which has to be prime location.Room was beautiful .the food was good.there was never any crowds and even though you should book some of your dinner reservations in advance ,still had to book a couple and found I had to wait 20 min on a line .some rest dont require reservations.there is also room service and you could order any time .thats a bit slow in the evenings.all in all I had a great time.I would recomend this.the beach is so beautiful .I find it better than the bahamas and beach in cancun.you will find no rocks or broken shells .sand is so smooth on bavaro beach.of course there are people taking advantage of all inclusive .you do see people ordering room service with loads of bottles of beer ,or people checking out with 2 or even 3 bottles of beer in their hand . one guy came up to the lobby bar and asked for a 6 pack.theres nothing wrong with that .I only saw one man at the pool get carried by the bartender ,and the wife following him up to their room .that happens .this is such a great family place to relax and rest ,no one bothers you .they keep every thing clean and maintained

<Content>I Will Not Be A Repeat Customer... I'm seeing all these positive reviews on this site and I'm seriously wondering if I stayed at the same place as these people posting positive reviews.Issue #1: Only about 20% of the service staff spoke english. The list of people who couldn't communicate with us included our housekeeper, all room service staff that delivered food to our room, waiters and waitresses in the buffet and hostesses in the buffet. The list goes on... If you go be prepard to speak spanish.Issue #2: Many of the service personal were just plain unfriendly. I think this is probably in some ways related to the afore mentioned communication gap. That being said, the last night of our stay I did encounter a particualrly rude front desk attendant. I phoned the desk at 9 p.m. to report that our remote control stopped working (you cant use the TV without a remote) and I was informed that I would have to wait until tomorrow. On the night stand next to the bed is a peice of litterature that GAURANTEES all defects in room equipment will be remedied within 15 minutes... So I pointed this out to the unfriendly attendant and a new remote was promptly delieved to my room.Issue #3: Beach towels were difficult to impossible to get after 1p.m.Issue #4: The food... Lets start with the buffet and the Market Grill...It was nothing to write home about and at times it was watery and picked over (gross). Aside from the food the buffet was horribly understaffed. Most of the time I would be done with my meal before the beverage I ordered arrived. Also, it was difficult to get a seat due to the high number of tables that hadn't been cleared from the previous diners. The premium resturants required 24 hours advance reservations even if tables were open if you didn't have 24 hours advance reservations it was impossible to get a seat. Unfortunatly, I can't write anything about the premium resturants because I didn't make 24 hour advance reservations, therfore I had to settle for watery and picked over.Issue #5: The water sports staff... In the sales propaganda there is a list of free or included watersports. Like kite surfing, kayaking, sailing, paddleboats, ect... Ok...so you walk down to the water sports area and ALL...I MEAN ALL the equipment is stacked up on the beach and you say...Hey, I wanna go kite sailing and immediately the guy starts trying to sell me a premium service...like parasailing or fishing. Which I had to say NO to at least 12 times before he stopped baggering me. Then he proceeds to tell me that I need to make a 24 hour advance reservation for watersports. Remember me saying that the equipment was stacked on the beach not being used? I pointed that out, and he ddin't budge. So, i made a reservation for the next day and when I arrived the wind was wrong for kite sailing...so I made a reservation for the next day and when I arrived I guess the guy saw that I wasn't going to quit so they decided to allow to kite sail. See a pattern here? Lazy and unintersted, that's the best way to describe them. I could go on, but you get the point...service was just horrible.Ok..so what was good. The beach was NEVER crowded when we were there. Alcohol flowed very very freely, although I don't drink. The resort was very well manicured. The rooms were very nice, lots of stonework, a big bathtub and a separate shower. Flat panel TV's, free minibar in the room. The pools were very nice, lots of places to find sun or shade, whichever you prefer.I was amazed that they'd spent so much money on the resorts construction and totally fumbled on service. I mean just failed miserably. I suppose that's why the beach was empty...Best wishes...TC

<Content>Is the name "Paradisus" an inference to "paradise?" NOT HERE! I've used this website as a reference many times before travelling, and I never felt compelled to write a review until now. Consider this review a warning to anyone pondering a vacation at this destination. Our family of 4 vacations every year. What we seek are nice accomodations, beautiful beach, good food, and no hassles. We are not snobs and would have no problem staying at a Marriott on the beach as long as it was quiet, comfortable, and clean. When we book at what is deemed a 4-star hotel we come with high expectations. This was our first mistake. Here is my laundry list:1) The Royal Service is a waste of money. My husband and I paid for a RS room which was identical to our children's regular room with the exception of the ocean view. Actually, our kids' room was nicer. Our room did not even have a door to the bathroom. it was a 'corral' style swing door affording no privacy whatsoever. They claim to reserve a part of the beach and pool for RS, but they never checked. Anyone could use their beach and pool. We downgraded to a regular room after seeing this, which was half the price.2) We moved rooms 3 times. And not one of the rooms had a bed that was remotely comfortable. The first room would not cool down sufficiently. The next room had 2 double beds, which were so rickety that whenever my husband rolled over in bed it creaked so loudly that it woke me up. The next room they gave us had such a musty smell and so many flies in the room. We finally settled on a room in a building that bordered an adjacent property that must have had a working farm, and every morning at 5:45 we were woken up by roosters. The water pressure in the shower was almost non-existent. And bring your own conditioner, they only have shampoo. And bring bug spray with DEET. You'll need it every night.3) The food. And i use that term loosely. Firstly, eat a huge breakfast. This is the only passable meal of the day. if you want a decent dinner, you need to make reservations which you cannot do until you actually arrive at the resort, at which time they have nothing available. you cannot do it by phone, you have to walk down to the clubhouse at the beach and wait in line with everyone else for 1 employee at a computer to search every restaurant for every day you are there. only to tell you you can eat at 9:30. When we finally did get a rservation (and it was only because someone was nice enough to give us theirs that they were not using) it was at the french restaurant that was awful. The steak restaurant too was bad, Chinese was worse, and the italian was basically stouffers entrees with elio's pizza. The only good restaurant we ate at was the Japanese one. My husband walked in there on our last night and tipped the hostess to let us eat at 6:45 without a reservation. The best move we made was the night we got in a cab and went to the Hard Rock Cafe and Tony Roma's 15 minutes away from the resort.4) The beach. If you are used to Caribbean beaches where the water is turquoise glass, and you can walk in and see your feet, this is not the beach for you. The surf had crashing waves and an undertow. We went snorkling one day and couldn't imagine that a 15 minute boat ride would take us to a reef that had calm waters. Of course, it did not. And the snorkling trip they provide is mediocre, at best. The equipment is passed on from one group to another without even cleaning the snorkles! Gross. My husband is an early riser, but even he wasn't early enough because by 7:30 am all the shaded bali beds were taken. We realized that people were putting towels on chairs the night before, and thus we had to do the same in order to have chairs on the beach. This is way too much of a hassle when you're on vacation. There is no one serving drinks on the beach. Every time you want a drink (and at an all inclusive, there are plenty of drinks being served) you have to get up and go to a bar and get it yourself. The help is kind and friendly but speak very little English. Some of the most basic requests were not understood. (i.e.'where is the bathroom?')5) The Casino is tiny. Don't come for the nightlife. If you must come here, there is only one place on the property I would stay. The RESERVE. It is a beautiful brand new complex with decent restaurants and a beautiful pool The rooms are brand new and very chic. However, if you are beach people and want to go back to your room during the day, it's a hike. They provide jitneys that take you back and forth. There was one thing that lingered with us. As we unzipped our bags back at home, the musty smell from our room was right back with us. Every article of clothing needed to be washed and fumigated. The memento of one HUGE disappointment in Punta Cana.

<Content>Careful of the ATM Just a heads up ..... I tried to take out some $$ from the hotel's ATM.... it dispensed the pesos then immediately withdrew them back into the machine and said transaction cancelled. So I waited and did the transaction again. When I got home --- BOTH transactions had been deducted from my bank account.I am disputing this and my bank says it happens sometimes so they are sure the funds will be deposited. Just be ready and GRAB that money quickly before it gets sucked backed in.Have a great vacation.... it is gorgeous !!!

<Content>Loved it! Was there 9-19 April. Great food, great service, excellent maintenance of the grounds. Overall: AWESOME The only thing I would change is the musty odor in my room and I should have brought repellant for the bugs that would follow me in. Most of the time it didnt matter because I was too drunk to notice :-). I highly recommend the Paradisius!

<Content>Great Vacation I was at Paradisus April 11 to 19 with my 15 year old niece. We were not on a package deal, so took a cab from the airport, very easy, $30.Checkin was quick and easy, our room was ready on arrival. The room was spacious, with 2 double beds, 2 small sofas, patio with nice furniture. The furniture and tile is a little dated, but nothing that bothered me. The room was very clean, maid service was wonderful. We had no problems with bugs.The beach is fabulous. It was a pretty rough several days during our stay, high waves making it difficult to get into the water. The other days were nice - enough waves for kids to play in, but not rough. They have a number of large palapas for shade. To get a spot in shade, you really needed to be out there by about 9am, but this was a very busy week, so that may not always be the case. They have nice metal/mesh chairs, not the crappy plastic ones so prevalent in all-inclusives. Although we did not use the pool, it is beautiful. Even better is the pool at the Reserve Section - gorgeous!Dining is important to me on vacation, and overall I was very pleased with the food. We used the buffets or room service for breakfast. For lunch we used the buffet and it was okay - nothing great, but you could always find something to eat. They also have a grill next to the beachfront buffet where you could get burgers and hot dogs. We had dinner the first night at El Marino, grilled lobster was good but a little mushy. El Romantico was my favorite - very nice atmosphere, good menu and food. The second night we were there they had a classical guitarist. Vento was also really good. Very chic modern decor, some unusual menu items. We ate at Gabi twice (you pay extra for this one). I love the atmosphere here. It is in the Reserve looking out over the pool. La Dolce Vita and Albufeira were both good, but nothing spectacular. One thing I found odd in all of the restaurants - you get your entree, and that's it. Never a vegetable on your plate. If you are a big eater, order a shrimp cocktail from room service before you go to dinner, or grab some pizza in the afternoon. They also do not have appetizers, just entree and dessert.The staff was great, very friendly and helpful. I speak decent Spanish so had no problems. For anyone who doesn't speak the language, you can still make yourself understood, so don't worry. The hotel gives you a little dictionary when you check in.Activity staff was great - very friendly and fun. My only criticism, and I'm more sensitive to this than most, is the loudness of the music everywhere. The beach restaurant was loud enough that you could hear it on the beach. I couldn't stay in the lobby bar at night - it was just awful there. There were a lot of families, but we were there during school vacation week. It was great for my niece. She met up with other kids her age and hung out with them. Also a lot of middle age couples. I think it might be a little tame for younger couples looking for a lot of night life. A Teen club would have been nice too.All in all, a great vacation, and I recommend the Paradisus.

<Content>Raving about the Reserves and wishing we were still there Yesterday we flew home from the best vacation of our 16 years of married life. We stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana...specifically, The Reserves section of the resort.Originally, we had booked a Jr. Deluxe Suite at the Paradisus Punta Cana, but when we arrived, we were very disappointed in the original room we were given. They offered to move us to a similar room in another building, but we knew that the room would be similar. The original room we were given had a small oval shaped jacuzzi tub that smelled so strongly of chlorine or some chemical, we had to open our patio door to air it out. Adding to that, we found a lone shower head above this tub..so just to take a regular shower, you had to climb two steps and treacherously step down into the jacuzzi! This was NOT what we envisioned ourselves doing for a week! First of all, it was just my husband and myself...the kids were home with Grandma. We wanted to feel really pampered and relaxed with an entire week with nothing to do but sun, surf, and sand. That shower did not fit our dream vacation scenario. Seems silly, but it was important to us. Adding to our displeasure were the beds themselves. We had two double beds that they pushed together to make one humongous bed with that gap in the middle...the mattresses were not good, and the pillows were so soft, they gave no support whatsoever...and they were the lumpy kind of soft too...so that was not going to be good. There was a tiny TV..ok...no big deal...and a wonderful patio with a nice view of the walkway and lush palm trees swaying in the breeze. If this room had a different bathroom with a luxury shower and a nicer bed, it would've been fine. It just felt old and uncared for. We wanted something more than that for the amount of money we paid, and the expectations we had.So, the front desk suggested we go check out a room at the Reserves. I wish we would've done it as soon as we got there..because instantly we were sold once we saw the room. NIGHT and DAY difference. WOW. It was worth the 700 extra for the week. Worth every penny. LOCATION: we had room 2437, which is in a central location...but with a garden parking lot view. That was ok with us...because the suite we were in was SWEEEEET!!!! The shower took our breath away....the jacuzzi tub was huge and clean. The bed was king sized with luxury sheets...and when you walked into the room, it smelled like a spa. Really, really, really nice. It had two flat panel TVs, a small stereo system (burn a few cds with a mix of your favorite tunes...wish we had done that because the radio only received one station of spanish music). There was a kitchenette with microwave, stovetop, and sink....which we never used....a couch, coffee table, and a patio with two padded chairs.The bedroom was actually able to be closed off with two sets of sliding Japanese doors...a nice cozy touch.The weird thing was that the toilet room felt open and exposed because of the striped frosted glass on the door that separated it from the sink area. You can close it off with real doors, but then no one else can be using the sinks or the shower. That was ok with just the two of us...but would've been weird traveling with family...The shower was a separate room with a glass door. The European shower head ran all the way down the one wall...and the water pressure coming from the main shower head was phenomenal. We really enjoyed the shower. It was a spa experience all the way....in a word, incredible.The jacuzzi would've been incredible had my sweet husband not added about 8 caps of bath foam to it! Let's just say that there were bubbles, bubbles, everywhere...The nice part about staying in the Reserves was being able to walk right out of our building to the back and there you are at one of the most beautiful pool areas I have ever seen. There was also an exclusive restaurant/buffet overlooking the pool, where you could eat all three meals if you wanted to. The food at this buffet was always very good, although a bit repetitious. I highly recommend the sea bass, freshly grilled by the chef behind the buffet. I ate it every day for lunch, and did not tire of it one bit. It was so delicious and tender. I really wanted a good ranch salad dressing, but they did not have one...that's my biggest complaint about this buffet. It's called the Gabi Restaurant and Lounge...and the bar there is top shelf. The guy manning the grill there--cooking your fresh fish and chicken and making your omelettes is a sweetie too...as were most of our wait staff. We were always welcomed everywhere we went. The employees are hard working and friendly. They want to serve you. We tipped a few dollars every time we ate and got drinks...and we wish we could've given more. The Reserves also has a signature gourmet restaurant called Vento. We enjoyed two dinners there. Highly recommend the Meditteranean Salad, the portabello mushroom, and the chicken francaise...along with the banana mousse for dessert. It is a classy restaurant. Ok...the pool. What a wonderful place to spend the day. There were plentiful Bali Beds, padded sun chairs, and padded sun beds. We never had a problem getting a shady bed and a sunny chair next to each other. My favorite part of the pool were the tile loungers in the water that were partly submerged. I literally fell asleep in them every afternoon. There are two bubbly areas that are within the pool, but not warm...same temp as pool. The water is nice and deep...but not too deep. There is a separate kids pool next to the main pool, with fun little slides, but the older kids liked the main pool better, I think. You could jump into it, and it wasn't too shallow. Our boys would have loved the main pool, and they are pre-teens. We also noticed a very active kids camp type program. There was a really cool playground, and a large building for the kids. I'm assuming there was some kind of babysitting too, we saw parents all dressed up dropping their kids off there for dinner. The Reserves is a great place to bring the kids, or to leave them home with Grandma!The beach. Lovely. Had a bit of a chair/bed issue, as we did not wake up early to put towels on them as some did. We noticed some shady beds reserved with a few towels, and no one ever showed up to claim their bed! This needs addressing by the resort. The sand is so soft and beautiful and the water is a turquoise color...a teeny bit cool, and one day it was a bit rough, but otherwise was a pleasure to float around in. Not as calm as I would've liked, but calm enough where I didn't worry about being bowled over by a wave or caught in a dangerous rip tide.The Royal Service area of the beach was very large compared to the Reserves area, and they had more beds, but we were very happy with the beach overall. Clean bathrooms by the beach, showers, a great selection of restaurants, and a tiny area of shops made it a beautiful place to really relax.Other restaurants: we ate at the French, which we thought was ok...not great. The steakhouse, which was good, and the hibatchi restaurant, which was fun if you had the right crowd at your table. We ate there twice, and the first night, we were the only English speaking people at our table. We felt a bit left out of the fun sounding conversations going on around us!! The Grandpa of the family spoke English, and he made conversation with us a little, which was great. The sushi is good...ask for two plates of it! The noodles are incredible, and they do not give you enough! One night the chicken was dry..the next night it was moist and delish. It is a Benihana type place...so do not expect more from it. The second night, we had more fun with all the people at our table who were from Montreal, Florida, and Ohio. The food overall was better than I had in Cancun and the Riviera Maya at the Palace resorts. The gym was also very nice to work out in...looking out over palm trees swaying was so motivating. They had spinning class and a bunch of weight machines, free weights, ellipticals, and treadmills. Our fave time to use the gym was around 4pm...practically empty then. Bring sneaks and gym clothes, as they are required. At night, after dinner, there is always some kind of live music in the lobby bar, shows in the theater, and more drinking to do! We enjoyed one full theater show...the movie review show. The songs were so fun..the dancers were excellent, and we saw a few familiar faces dancing on stage who were serving us during the day...so that was fun. The show with all the Spanish songs was ok...we had to pack, so we left that show early.Have a chocolate martini at the lobby bar. Yummy... Bring a Bubba Mug to fill with the frozen concoction of your choice...this was GREAT at the beach, instead of the plastic cups that get sandy and melted in about two minutes! I got ours at Target before we left. Good advice if you like your frozen drinks to remain frozen and cold for a good long while!So, to conclude, here are my recommendations. If you want a better room and more amenities, either stay in the Royal Service area of the resort, or stay at the Reserves. Everyone we spoke with who stayed in Royal Service was very pleased, and we certainly were pleased with our room at the Reserves. I would go back tomorrow if I could!! The whole experience was magical. Just remember to bring lots of one dollar bills, and to have 10 dollars cash on hand per person when you get off the plane in Punta Cana. You must pay this to enter the country. Pack lots of bathing suits, and lots of sunscreen, and dressier outfits for the evening. Pants/jeans for guys..close toed sandals...button down shirts or polos...and for the ladies, one pair of go-with all strappy sandals for night, dark jeans or cute capris or skirts, and a couple of fancy wow tops, and a clutch, and you are all set! Also, the resort provies you with great spa shampoo and bath soap, but no conditioner, so bring your own hair conditioner! I spent countless hours on this site, trying to decide where to stay in Punta Cana, and I am sooooo glad we stayed at the Reserves. Maybe I can save you HOURS of agonizing! You will not be disappointed by the Reserves at the Paradisus Punta Cana! I do solemnly swear!

<Content>All we hoped for ! Loved the Royal Service My husband and I stayed at this wonderful resort from 3/29-4/5/08. We wanted an 'exhale' type of vacation as a special celebration of our 50th bdays this year. After reading thru some of the negative reviews on this website, we had some reservations that perhaps we had booked this too hastily.I am glad to say we had no need to worry and am writing this to benefit anyone else with such concerns.I cannot say enough good things about this resort.  First and foremost - the beauty: We have travelled quite a bit to the Carribean (St. Maarten, Martenique, Bahamas, Puerto Rico) ,Mexico (Cancun and Riviera Maya) , and Hawaii and I have to say that 4 hrs from NYC is an absolute paradise. The website photos just cannot do it justice.We were very pleased driving up to this resort. (We got a cab from the airport - $30-35, half hour ride) The grounds here are beautifully designed and well maintained.The amazing white sand beach and the pristine water are mesmerizing , as were the lush foliage, the sophisticated architecture within the resort , and the balmy tropical breeze. (Sol Melia gives alot of thought to ambiance and I would find that many times the subtle backround music would complement what I was looking at perfectly. )We opted for the Royal Service, mostly for the privacy it offered - we have done our time raising our own kids (now grown and out of the house) and my husband teaches young children so we figured this would be a perk. We moved our vacation forward one week, and the drop in the rates made booking the RS almost a wash. If you want to make your stay extra special, you must book the Royal Service. It is pampering and a bit more classy without being pretentious. However, you need to know how to use it (which we figured out by the 3rd day) and this is one of the reasons I am writing this. Refer to my notes below for more details. Above all, the staff at this resort is the among the best. I have never felt so authentically welcomed and pampered in my life. Everyone was very accomodating and pleasant. Also, unlike anywhere else I have stayed, we never felt that a tip was expected here but it was always greatly appreciated. We brought 50 singles and a bunch of $5 as we had read and that was very convenient for tipping...that was a good idea. I speak some Spanish and my husband a few words. Everyone was so charming and extended themselves, but in particular we made some good friends with the excellent staff: Mickair (made us laugh until we cried) Jose and Jerimiah - these guys were all attentive and kind. We were impressed with the staff's character, intelligence, and great sense of humor . There was always someone available on the beach bringing us fresh fruit with honey, our drinks or even get us a pizza or burger. Juan was our valet/butler and he fixed some of our misunderstandings about the Royal Service....some things we expected , that you really need to ask for. He took great care of us and all of our needs - even setting up a jacuzzi for us complete with tea lights and bouganvelia. And he made our checkout a breeze! I must comment that this is a happy and warm culture, and I never felt any underlying resentment or hostility as I have detected in some other vacation locations from the staff.Royal Service gets you access to this amazing Spa type pool (as if the gorgeous lagoon pool was not enough). And it was never very crowded. (In fact we never even went to the lagoon pool because it always seemed more crowded, more 'hiper'.) The RS pool is adjacent to the beach, has its own swim up bar and lots of Bali beds both in and out of the sun. As did the RS section of the beach. There was always somewhere to lie and a way to get out of the sun. Also there was an impressive assortment of suntan products at the pool - nice touch. You also have the waiter service on the beach which is just so nice! Accomodations: our room was adjacent to the beach (1258) and I must say we never had any problem with bugs or musty odors as I have read in other reviews. The room was large and airy . The AC worked just fine but many times we would have our slider open to get that tropical breeze. I suppose the bathroom could have used some updating - it was not brand spanking new but this seemed part of the character of being in the Carribean to me. If I wanted gleaming faucets and tubs i could go to a Hyatt in South Beach. The food: We found our favorite food is what is native to this culture- we loved the rice and beans and native dishes - we esp. liked the Brazilian restaurant. The Hibisus buffet was always excellent and the Seafood buffet (Palapa Grill) was very good. But all the food was quite good (no, not on a NYC par but but you need a reason to go home, right?) - we liked Vento alot. Also we found that if we didnt have a reservation for a restauarant they would try to accomdate us anyhow - maybe it helped that we said we were Royal Servce - that seemed to carry alot of weight.Notes: 1) You need to let your valet/butler know what you need by asking . Eg, bucket of ice, cokes, and some Corona's at 5 pm, etc. Be specific. Extra towels, extra chocolates, newspaper every day , etc. 2) Try to book all your dinner reservations when you first get there. Reservations fill up fast and we seemed to have dinner at 9:30 a lot (which is almost normal for us but not most people.) We didnt book all our dinner reservations at once and should have done so on our first day there.3)Get a map (they have a small bookklet they call a passport) of the grounds - at least if you are in RS. Since you dont have the traditional check-in process in RS , we missed/forgot all that was available at first - i.e bicycles, gym, Spa, etc. I also liked getting an overview of the grounds to get my bearings.  4)On your flight down you need to think about the types of things you want stocked in your minibar - or what you would like waiting when you return from the beach - then let your butler know. We asked that everyday at 5:30 we have a bucket of ice, some Stoli Vodkas (btw no problem with top shelf alcohol) , orange juice, and fresh fruit, nuts and chips left in our room - we I also asked for lots of water because I get dehydrated easily and was left a case of water every day. We would come in from the beach and then have a cocktail while we showered for dinner. Very nice. Sometimes they missed the chips or nuts, but overall this worked out well.5) Try the massage on the beach - which i thought was very reasonable - $45 for half an hour. Very cool. 6)Time share pitch - all i can say is we waffled about it - shut them down at the start if you are not interested - don''t even give them any hope. Be firm and they won't bother you again..7)Golf - my husband played golf twice, course was great, book your tee times ahead - even before you leave for vacation. Since the greens fees are included as a guest, my husband opted to share a taxi with some other golfers ($14 oneway) instead waiting for the bus. 8)Clothes - men need long pants at the better restaurants at night. May want a sweater because it can get windy and comfortably cool at night. But you don't need tons of daytime clothes since you seem to live in your swimsuit and your evening clothes.9) We had an absolute blast on this trip - we laughed and relaxed and had a wonderful time. Anything that was not perfect was made perfect just by asking - there really are 'no worries' here - so just enjoy!

<Content>great vacation-be aware of the phone calls My husband and I had a great time .The resort is a real paradise and the people are very friendly . We went scuba diving at Catalina Island and was a great time. Just be aware of the phone call you`re going to make . There`s a company call BBG COMMUNICATION that charge $10 per minute when we were told that was $1 per minute . I don`t think tha resort is aware of this scam. Use american express they will refund you the money. when i google BBG communication i couldn`t believe how many people were scammed like me.

<Content>A Great Place to Rejuvenate with your family Check In: They were just ok. We wanted connecting rooms and they could not accomodate until the next day. Manuel on the desk was very helpful in stepping up and finding us connecting rooms the next day. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. They always have gardeners trimming the coconut trees. We loved walking through the paths on the resort .Rooms-Clean and comfortable. Some are nicer than others. Some fridges colder than others. Nothing outstanding, but they have that tropical feel that I like when I am in the tropics. I did not find the rooms to be musty. Our maid spoke no english but she kept our room spotless and at night we had turn down and she would leave little gifts.Food-Loved it ! The food was great. Loved all the Restaurants. I do not have any complaints about the food and I am picky. The nighttime dinners do not cater to children.......No big deal. They have 24 hour room service and my kids loved the pizza! They would eat it before we went to the restaurants.Pool-great pool. My kids had a blast in the pool. All different depths which made it fun. We also used the kids pool in the reserve. They had a couple of toddler water slides. Great fun for my 3 year old.Service-Majority of people were very friendly even with the language barrier. I think we ran across only 1 person who was having a bad day. The next day that same person was very friendly.Lobby bar-makes the best tasting drinks.Pool bar-the greatest guys.Gabby bar-strongest drinks.Beach-lovely and maintained. The beach out front of the Paradisus was looked after better than some of the other resorts.Bugs-did not see any bed bugs. I did see them replacing many of the mattresses with new ones. Not sure if they were just renovating or if they were fixing a situation. We did see skeeters outside in the morning, but they were not flying. We had maybe 5 on the ceiling of our balcony. Only saw 2 in the bathroom. I brought room spray with me and bug rep. We used it at night. We did not get swarmed by bugs. My 3 year old did get 2 on his ankles. You are in the tropics you are going to see a few bugs. It was really a non issue for our family.We had a great family vacation. It was a great place to reconnect and enjoy our family. We wanted a great beach, great food, smiling faces and a great pool. We got all that and more.

<Content>beautiful place We just returned from a five day stay at the Paradisus, and were very happy with the experience. We did not have any of the problems that we read about in the reviews, and the whole trip couldn't have been smoother.Transportation and arrival: VIP met us at the airport and drove us in an air-conditioned van to the hotel, making one stop at another hotel along the way. Trip took about half an hour.We were met at the hotel by our concierge, Jean Henri, who was very helpful and nice. Our room was not yet ready (it was only 1pm), but we were offered tasty drinks of the Paradisus drink, a tropical-type daquiri. Then Jean Henri drove us down to the restaurant area, where we had a nice lunch. We took the trolly back to the lobby, and our room was ready. Check-in took about 5 minutes.Grounds: The property is absolutely beautiful, with ponds, fountains, and flowers everywhere. It was very well maintained, and it was a pleasure to walk from place to place amid the tropical landscaping. The beach is also large and beautiful with very soft white sand. The pool is large and a meandering lagoon, with a swim-up bar. We had no trouble getting lounge chairs under palm umbrella shades at the beach or at the pool, which was important to us as we burn easily. We also had no trouble getting towels when we needed them.Room: Our room (#2356) was very nice. It was clean, and we did not find any bugs. In fact, we had no problem with bugs at all. We each got one mosquito bite, but that was all. We had thought of upgrading to a Reserve room, but we were perfectly happy with the room. Each day the maid left flowers on our towels and/or a small bouquet in a glass. We had read reviews mentioning saloon-type doors to the bathroon, but we had a real door between the sink area and the toilet/bathtub area.The resort is quite big, but trolleys come around every five minutes of so if you want a ride instead of walking.Food: Food was generally quite good. Breakfast at the Hibiscus was very good, with an omelet station, a station for eggs or grilled meat, a fruit smoothie station, and buffet assortment of meats, cheeses, breads, fried bananas, etc. Pizza was ok for lunch at the Italian place. Most days we went to the beach seafood grill where you can pick out a fish and they will grill it for you, with a nice sauce on top. We had dinner at the French place (tenderloin was good), the Brazilian (would not recommend, the meat was overcooked), the Vento, and the Steak (also good tenderloin). Service: We found the service to be terrific. Almost every person we came into contact with was helpful and hospitable. I speak no Spanish, but got lots of fun Spanish lessons from staff, and almost everyone spoke some English. If you are nice to the staff you will find that they are very nice, helpful and warm.Our concierge did try to get us to go to the time-share info session, but we firmly refused, and were not bothered again.Nightlife: Basically, there isn't any. We got up early, and ate dinner late, so after that we were tired and went to bed. If you are looking for night life, this is probably not the place for youAfter worrying a bit due to some negative reviews, we were totally satisfied with our vacation and would go back.

<Content>A nice resort After reading many of the lukewarm reviews before my trip 鈥?I didn鈥檛 know what to expect. So I felt compelled to add my two cents after my stay at the Paradisus PC from April 2 鈥?6. All in all we had a wonderful stay. Room:I had emailed before our arrival requesting a room close to the pool on the second floor and both requests were met. Since we were arriving before the 3pm check in, we did not think our room would be ready and came prepared with bathing suits, etc to change into. So we were not disappointed when they told us to come back at 3pm to pick up the key. We did not stay in the Reserve nor did we opt for Royal Service and we didn鈥檛 mind one bit. Personally, although the Reserve is newer and very nice, it鈥檚 too far from the beach and main pool 鈥?just my humble opinion. I would rather stay closer to the beach. Our room seemed to have been updated recently as the bathroom was modern and had a 鈥渞eal鈥?door instead of the half doors that you may have read in other reviews. I never saw any bugs in our room nor did I wake up to bed bug bites. Our room was cleaned daily and efficiently. I felt the room service was a big plus 鈥?we ordered pizzas one night and they were delivered in 15 minutes!Grounds/pool and service:The property is expansive and although they do have the shuttles to take you from one end to the other, it is still very manageable to walk from one end to the other which we often did. The grounds are very pretty and well kept. I found 98% of the staff to be pleasant, friendly and very helpful. And to my surprise, all of the staff that I encountered spoke moderate to good English 鈥?I never had a problem with communication. Food:Overall the food was very good. The buffet was like most other all inclusive buffets that we鈥檝e seen before. Not 5 stars, but I never went hungry. We ate at the steak house restaurant (very good), Italian (very, very good), the Chinese restaurant (average) and Vento which is in the new Reserve area. I was so excited about Vento based on previews reviews and it鈥檚 a very posh setting, but the food was just average. I had the Ox tail and my husband had the Lamb and both were presented very well, but were just a bit bland. One thing that I was pleasantly surprised at was the bottled wine 鈥?good to very good in my opinion. We had mostly red wine with every meal and they offered Italian and French wines which we really enjoyed. Beach/pool:Outstanding. Probably one of the nicest beaches I鈥檝e seen thus far in my travels to the Caribbean. I鈥檝e been to many places including Riviera Maya, Virgin Islands, Jamaica, Bahamas, and I have to admit that this beach was among one of the best. Very wide, probably the softest sand that I鈥檝e touch in a LONG time. We took many walks on the beach in both directions and felt that the Paradisus had one of the nicest sections of beach. The pool was really nice as well and the swim up bar a lot of fun. The only complaint that I have is not about the Paradisus, but about the dreaded 鈥渞eserve鈥?the chair game that everyone plays. It was no exception here. Folks were out by 7am claiming chairs and I would no doubt see those chairs go empty for the majority of the day. All in all we had a very pleasant stay at the Paradisus. If I鈥檓 being completely honest, was it the nicest resort I鈥檝e ever stayed at?...probably not. Was it the worst?...not by a long shot. It definitely ranked somewhere in the top 5 all inclusive resorts that I鈥檝e been to. Although it may be showing its age just a bit, I felt that they did a good job at updating some of the rooms and amenities and overall it鈥檚 really nice and I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate recommended this resort to any of my friends or family.

<Content>Excellent Resort My husband and I just returned from a terrific vacation in Punta Cana. We were extremely happy with the Paradisus Punta Cana. We had read many mixed reviews prior to choosing this resort, which is why I feel it is important to write this review. We stayed at Paradisus from March 30th through April 6th. We found the check-in process to be extremely relaxing and simple. As we exited our bus at the hotel, we were greeted by a concierge named Pueblo. We sat on a sofa in an open, gorgeous lobby (with a drink in hand) while Pueblo checked us in. We were taken to our room by a very nice bell boy, and we were sitting on a beautiful patio in our room within 20 minutes of arriving at the resort. The process could not have been more simple, or more pleasant for that matter. The entire resort is breathtakingly gorgeous. The grounds are unbelievable, and the beach is paradise! With reservations (made by Pueblo) we ate at the French restaurant, Romantico, the steak house, AlBufera, and the Italian Restaurant. All our food, including the buffets, was extremely good. The restaurant on the beach is large and beautiful. It has a grill section where you can order a hamburger or hot dog, but most of the restaurant overlooks the ocean with a large amount of tables set with beautiful dinnerware. There is a buffet lunch served all day there, and the buffet incudes take out containers so you can bring your lunch to the beach if you so choose. The beach restaurant was my favorite place on the resort. We went there one evening for dinner, and it was beautiful. The dinner in the beach restaurant is seafood. Though the seafood is dfferent than what we are used to in Boston, it was extremely good. Room service was excellent. There were many days after returning from the beach that we ordered a bottle of wine. We also ordered pastries and pizza from room service. Room service was phenomenal, and we never waited more than 30 minutes for anything. The staff at the Paradisus are beyond friendly. They work extremely hard, they are unbelievably friendly and sweet. Our room was very nice. The rooms, however, are old and need to be updated. Our bath included a very nice jacuzzi tub. We did not stay in the Reserve section, and we did not regret that. We did tour the Reserve, and it is definitely gorgeous, but we are beach people and the Reserve is way too far from the beach for our liking. Our room was in bungalow 21. The resort covers quite a bit of ground, but our room was in a great location near the beach and very close to all the restaurants. We have every intention of returning to the Paradisus next year at this time, and I will pay a little more money to move two bungalows closer to the ocean so I can sit on my second floor patio and see the ocean. We honestly can't say anything negative about our stay at Paradisus. We did run into couples at the airport who stayed at other resorts and had a horrible time. We were told of mosquitoes and bad food causing sickness. I would not consider staying at another resort. We walked the beach many times and were convinced that we were lucky to have chosen the Paradisus. For an all-inclusive it was absolutely amazing. Food and drink (including top shelf liquors and beer) were abundant . We are already thinking of our return to the Paradisus and the friendly Dominican people!One more thing worth mentioning. We read many reviews about the lack of service and the language barrier. My husband and I do not speak Spanish. We didn't find the language barrier to be a real problem. Most of the staff at the Paradisus understood enough English to assist us whenever we asked. We thought the service was excellent.

<Content>Good/Bad Our family stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana for a week in April 2008 . It has large nicely landscaped grounds, beautiful blue ocean, large lagoon pool, pure white sandy beach, nice restaurants (loved the French, American, Chinese, and beachside Grill buffet restaurants). The good -- food was generally very good (two buffets for breakfast and lunch, and several other restaurants for evening), top brands of alcohol, beach and pool were beautiful, nice indoor health club, plenty of charming settings to sit and relax, and transportation around resort available. Loved the beach daybeds under palapas.The negatives -- it took a long time for check in/out, very windy for several days, room had a mildew smell and all our clothes and suitcases had the odor after getting home, maid service was average with too few room towels, beds were hard, bedbugs (two of us came home with large welts), impossible to reserve at some special restaurants, and impoverished outside resort. Like most resorts, it was difficult to get a beach or pool chair without getting up early to reserve one.

<Content>Not thrilled second time in DR in the last two years.last time i stayed at ocean blue which was just built at that time. in comparison found paradisus facility to be very old, but food selection and quality was better.if you do not get royal service get get your restaurant conformations in advance .Seems like they want you to eat at the buffets and give you a hard time giving you reservations even if the tables are available. royal service customers have no such problems. there is a new section opened two months ago called the RESERVE, that was beautifull, facility and service at the RESERVE is worth the money but i was not happy with the old facility and marginal service i received at the old facility

<Content>Not Horrible, Not Outstanding Just returned with my husband and kids 7 and 11. To put my review in context this is our 4th trip to DR, 2nd to PC and 6th all-inclusive experience with the kids. I also travel a lot for work and stay in 3 - 5 star hotels.For those who are new to DR travel, be aware that the star rating for these all inclusives is not the same as in the US. A 5 star all inclusive iin DR is like a 3 - 4 star in the US. Also, most hotels are all-inclusive because you really don't want to leave the property. It's not like other islands where you go downtown to shop, eat or see the sights. Stay on the property!In DR, we've always stayed at Iberostars, so we wanted to try a different hotel this time.To respond to the other reviews. Yes, there are definately more mosquitos than other resorts. I think because of the on property swamp and other ponds. Bring OFF. We did not have issues with bugs or bed bugs in our room. The beds were fine and we didn't have any problems sleeping.The staff at this resort speak significantly less English than my other DR and Cancun experiencs. In fact one night at dinner I overheard a woman ask the waiter where the bathroom was and the waiter didn't understand, so I assisted. My experience is that front desk, concierge, wait staff are much more bi-lingual. Especially on basics. The service is not as good as we've experienced elsewhere. The beach bathroom was often unclean, overflowing garbage, no soap, etc. At the Iberostar, they had someone assigned to each bathroom. At the restaurant our plates would pile up with no one coming to pick them up. One time, I moved them to another table and watched them sit there for some time before a manager came by and cleared the table.The food is average. All inclusive is not gourmet. It will get repetitive if you have a long stay. No restaurant was outstanding. The kids club has been moved to the reserve. The pool is very nice and the building has nice bathrooms, computers, big screen TV, playground, etc. However, the bar won't serve you if you are not a guest of the reserve. It is also a 10 minute walk or 5 minute tram ride from the main part of the hotel. The shows, as at most all inclusives, are high school musical level. They also start very late at 10:15. Not very family friendly. Not very entertaining.The beach is nice and we had no problem getting chairs there or at the main pool. However, there were little to no activities there for the kids. At Iberostar, the Star Friends find the kids and get them involved in activities.The landscaping is amazing and very tropical. The trams run often in the evening and less so during the day. The pool is a nice size and not too deep with many shallow areas for the kids. My daughter did horseback riding with the kids club and enjoyed it. It was free.I used the business center to check us in online and print our boarding passes. It is not a part of the hotel, so you can not charge the computer use to your room and you must have cash!Overall, it's not a horrible place. You will have a nice time. However, I've been to better and would recommend other DR or all inclusive hotels before this one.

<Content>Another great trip Our second year at the Paradisus. We had another great time. 16 people altogether, from age 2 to age 75. We stayed in unit 20, one back from the beach, and close to the pool and most of the restaurants.The new Reserve section looked nice, but was a hike to the beach, and the additional people added some crowding to the restaurants. They are adding a new restaurant/nightclub in the lobby and that should help. Also, they added new trolleys, and the walkway was sometimes hazardous with all the trucks and trolleys.We reserved chairs before 8 at the beach, but there were usually more available. There was a lot of wind the first three days and there was significant wave erosion down the beach, with trees down in the water and we heard that the dolphins, sharks and rays escaped from Dolphin Island. There were no boats out those first days because of the wind and waves.More Americans and more Russians than last year, but a great mix of people.Learn some spanish before you go, and tip the workers, they are very friendly and appreciate it.

<Content>Great Vacation! I have written reviews on Punta Cana before, so I feel I have to do one on this property. One word, Perfect! I can give you a fair opinion on the overall property because we stayed in both the Reserve rooms and the regular Jr. Suites on the same trip. I have a 5 yr old and 7 year old and they both had a blast! There are tons of activities for both the kids and adults. We went back to Punta Cana because of the ease of getting there from the East Coast, and the properties. I am an Airline Pilot and we go to one of these all inclusive things each year for the kids spring break. This by far tops all the other AI's we have been to. The food was excellent! Not only the buffets, but the a la carte restaurants were awesome.What we really liked was the variety and the healthy choices you could make (or not!!) We ate at the steak house, Japanese, and the new Vento in the Reserve section of the hotel. The Jr. Suite room is where we stayed the first 3 nights. It was very nice, typical Caribbean room. It was a good size, clean, and the bathroom was fine. The air worked well and the TV had a lot of US channels. Our Nanny came down for 3 nights into our trip and we could not get rooms near each other on the property, so I elected to upgrade to the Reserve rooms (Reserve is the newest section of the property. It was opened Xmas '07) The rooms were spectacular! There were 2 flat screen TV's in it, a very good size Jacuzzi and well appointed bathroom. The upgrade was $50.00 a night and was well worth it! If I would have known earlier in our trip I would have done it! The property is HUGE! The kids club is up in the new section. We do not typically leave the kids in a kids club on family vacations, however they wanted to check it out and they loved it! It was fun for us, as we got to play tennis or workout when they were up there. The pools are great! The ones in the reserve section were quiet and it was easy to find a hut or chair. My wife is a dermatologist, so finding shade is a must! We love the beach, but we are the dumb looking ones all covered up!! We loved the fact that if we wanted to head down to the beach, it was a good 10 minute walk and we were getting lots of foot time,although they have golf carts that come by a lot and will take you any where you want to go...The people could not be nicer! I think like in anything else the nicer you are, the more out of the way folks will go for you..The property has a vacation club. The workers will ask you if you want to go to a 1 hour session and they will give you some kind of certificate for it. we declined and we were not asked again on our trip. I played golf on their course which is about 15 minutes away and was pleasantly surprised in the course. They don't charge you greens fees, just for the cart which I think was around $30.00 US. They bus you over there and pick you up. You have to make a reservation 24 hours in advance I wanted to play that afternoon and when I inquired at the PR desk and they told me to go get my clubs and I could get the bus in an hour. I also went over to Cap Cana to play and it was the nicest course I have played on worldwide. It was in perfect shape and the views are spectacular! Check it out on TV the week of March 31, The Champions Tour is there for the first time and I think they will love the course. It is about a 30 minute ride over there. Overall, a great experience, great family vacation, and we will be back!!

<Content>Great Time We stayed at the Paradisus for our honeymoon. The day leading up to us getting there was very long, we had an 8 hour drive from Puerto Plata to Punta Cana, when we arrived the staff was very friendly and we got checked in quickly. Our room was very nice. I did have a problem with the air conditioning, it seems our thermostat was very off and it was always freezing in our room. My husband loved this because he hates the heat, but I have a tendency of always being cold, so this was not great for me. The resort is beautiful and very large. We had been told that to get a reservation at the Japanese restaurant you would have to make it a week in advance (this did not work for us since we were only going to be there 4 days), so we went to one of the concierge and he was able to get us in that night! The food at this resort is delicious. The sales people who put up shop at night are a bit pushy (and very over priced in my opinion). Overall we really liked the hotel. We had 4 days of doing nothing but lounging around, and we loved it! The pool is great and the beach is beautiful. We would definitely recommend it.

<Content>My family really enjoyed this resort!! I had the pleasure to stay at this beautiful resort for 6 days from March 8-14. I am a 52 year old physician who traveled with my 51 year old wife and 3 children ages 24,22  18. It was a great trip and to a person everyone agreed it was the best family trip we have ever had. Everybody comes to a resort with different expectations and so the reviews are all so different when one reads them all. It is so important to read as many as you can to notice a trend so I feel it is my obligation as a traveler to pass on my opinion to be apart of this community of travelers.Checkin was very easy. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly. An additional person comes over to help with additional explanation of the resort. A waiter simultaneously came over to offer my family and I a cocktails while we were in the process of completing our check-in. All in all a very pleasant check in experience. The gentleman was very helpful sitting down with us, expalining all the restaurants and offering to make reservations for all the nights. I agreed and gave him a $10 for all his help. We were taken to our rooms with our bags on one of their carts. The bellmen are very friendly and professional and did their job well. The basic room is a large junior suite with a stepdown sitting area with two loveseat couches and a cocktail table. Our room had a king bad and our children's room had two queen beds with a cot brought in as ordered for our third child. The rooms at one time were state of the art however they are about 12 years old and it is important to know when booking that the resort is int he middle of a renovation. Some rooms are gogeous like those seen on the newer Paradisus Palma Real website and then there are older rooms like the kind we had. Since it was so much nicer than any Club Med Family resort that my family had ever gone to, it didn't bother me but I am not that picky. The older rooms defintely need work and I was told that by next year all the rooms will be completely updated. The rooms are stocked with soft drinks and bottle water however a simple call to your free Room service and your fridge can be stocked with all the beer you want. If the the look of the room is imperative to you, book the Reserve area or the Royal Service. Those are the better rooms at the present time but all will be very nice soon. No problems with towels, maid service or shampoo replenishment.I didn't use Royal Service and feel good about it. I costs about $175/night/room additional to have a butler bring you drinks on the beach as opposed to walking to the cool Gabi Beach bar. They also make your restaurant reservations for you but remember the guy I met at the beginning did that for us. Since I knew I would write this I decided to check out how to make reservations anyway. There is a lovely lady at a desk upon entering the main dining room with all the menus and you can make all the reservations at one time yourself. Now that was tough wasn't it.. When I travel just with my wife I generally tend to go with better service but my kids are already too jaded and they need to return to reality since they will be entering the real world soon. The beach and pool is magnificent and their were plenty of chairs. We never had a problem finding a spot to settle in. The resort is absolutely gogeous and is extremely well maintained. Never did we find any garbage affecting the beauty of the property. The staff is friendly and helpful without any sense of attitude that they are looking for tips. I brought many single dollar bills as recommended and I felt good giving out tips for exceptional service however I didn't have to wave dollars to get this service nor was there any attitude with tip expectation. This was just remarkable to me. This place just has a wonderful staff. The restaurants and buffets were very good but are not the level of a great NYC restaurant. However, every restaurant had a beautiful ambience and was unique in it's own way. When I go to a high line All Inclusive like this resort , I expect it to be good which it was so I was very satisfied as was my family . The service at all the restaurants was very professional and attentive.My family and I took advantage of the beautiful four Har-true tennis courts every day. There are always pro's to hit with you or give you a lesson at no additional course. We also useed there batting cage and archery cage. It was a lot of fun. I checked out the spa and it was very nice and if you were inclined you could get a message right on the beach or the pool area. We didn't use any of the many services they offered though there were quite a few at a charge.My only other complaint was the constant reminder about checking out the presentation for the Paradisus Vacation club. I mentioned the nice gentleman who was so helpful and friendly at the check-in. He was the same guy who wanted me to see the presentation. Because he was so nice and I found out he gets a commision, I decided to go and see the presentation with one of their sales rep. He also kept mentioning that if you are not happy with the presentation you can leave after 10 minutes. On the last day, I decided to give them 30 minutes fo a presentation and just to get to the point with tthe deal after all you can leave after 10 minutes right.... One problem!! When you sit down, you have to sign a pseudo contract for a committment to spend 1.5 hrs for the presentation. I was told by this nice broker, that you can always leave but you just have to sign this. I said No Thanks and left. My nice friend was not happy and I felt bad and I don't need any stress on my vacation as silly as this was. I told my wife I was not going to let this rediculous sales pitch taint a magnificent vacation.All in all it was a great trip and as one person I met at the black jack table This place is pretty high up on the All Inclusive food chain but it's not a Four Seasons I would agree and I defintely would go back.

<Content>Heaven at Paradisus My husband and i stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana from March 1st---March 13. i would have easily stayed for another two weeks. We did book royal service and loved it. upon arrival, we were taken to a private check in and served champagne and given cool fresh smelling towels. we checked in with Helonkis who is a real gem and an asset to this resort. She was very kind and helpful. my luggage had not arrived with us and she assured me she would take care of it. I was extremely worried and she did call the airport for us and my luggage arrived the next day. she had done all the work for us. thank you Helonkis. our butler turned out to be a genuine sweetheart as well. ALI took such good care of us and seemed to anticipate our needs. i told him we liked a bottle of wine in our room after our day at the beach and getting ready for dinner. i only had to tell him this once during the 2 weeks and we had a bottle of wine every day. He also did our jacuzzi set up one nite and it was so romantic and well thought out. Thank you ALI. we appreciate everything. We had a very clean and comfortable room in Bungalow 1. Right off the beach. Perfect location and no complaints with the room at all. no bugs, cleaned everyday and our maid left us little gifts and surprises everyday. the restaurants were also very clean and food was good also. Never went hungry or thirsty for that matter. Being that this was our 6th trip to Punta Cana we sort of knew what to expect. But we found the Paradisus to be much better than other resorts we have stayed at. Plenty of variety and lots of top shelf liquors. We got top service at all the restaurants and bars. Yes, we are big tippers, but i myself have been a server for 15 years and i know how hard they work. We always went to visit Francesco at the Gabi Lounge after dinner. The music is so relaxing at that bar and nice ocean breeze. Isreal at the Hisbiscus Lounge is a heart on two legs. He took good care of us and had our drinks ready when he'd see us walking in. Very good person with an awesome personality. To be honest the one and only bad complaint i have and it has nothing to do with the resort is the loud europeans. Can't tell you how many times we tried to nap on the beach and were awoken by them. No need to be so loud. and if they weren't being loud they were busy picking their noses. What is up with that?? All in all, we had a super vacation and can't wait to go back to see all our friends. Dominicans are the best people in the world and every time we go it gets harder and harder to leave. A big piece of our hearts always stays there. Simply cannot understand why someone would have bad service there. treat them with respect and they will return it 10 times. in closing, please do not hesitate in booking this resort. and if you do please tell Helonkis, Ali, and isreal that Keith  Brenda say hello and send their love. please let me know if you have any questions.

<Content>Far from five star We booked a five-star holiday (Jan 31 - Feb 7) wanting to celebrate a marriage of 43 years 鈥?a gift of a good life. We love swimming and the beach. We like to celebrate together as we have and do take our grown children and their families with us on holiday each year. Our travel agent convinced us to take the higher priced package at the Paradisus Punta Cana We agreed to go there because we had a great experience at the Paradisus Riviera Cancun in the Mayan Riviera with our family 4 years ago. Here is our story.The Air Transat Plane was 2 hours late leaving due to a problem with the scheduled plane, so they had to wait for another from Colombia. Consequently we got to the resort at about 12:30 a.m. their time.The check-in was pretty smooth. Clerk had drinks brought over to the desk. We asked for a room near the beach and pool Our room was the farthest away from the beach and the pool.We got on the bus to our room. There was an extremely drunk passenger in the cab with the driver. He was loud and obnoxious. He tried to start the engine when the driver was away taking bags to a room. The next time the driver left he tried to start the bus again and then started pushing. He finished his act by peeing on the lawn in front of our building. This was not a good first impression.Room #1 鈥?1354We were in building 35 鈥?farthest from pool and beach. We found no water bottles, no juice, no beer in fridge. Turns out they never have juice or beer 鈥?only soft drinks and water. This is contrary to info in AT magazine and on internet.There were 2 double beds 鈥?we had asked for a king-size. The first bed we tried had no top sheet, just the blanket. The other bed had a top sheet.There was no coffee-maker.The bathroom was sub-standard. The shower was behind a curtain with a 1 inch step-down. The shower was hand-held with no way to secure it. There was no shampoo.There was a door stop in front of the toilet so you stubbed your toe each time you used the toilet.. The changeWe asked for a change to a better room on Friday morning (After eating after check-in it was 4 am so we just slept in the double bed with the top sheet.)We were told they couldn鈥檛 change us until Saturday 鈥?no rooms available. So we asked for the manager and after some time we were told they could in fact give us a room that day 鈥?call back at 3 pm. Called at 3 鈥?manager out. Called at 4 鈥?told they had a room with a king bed in the same building. but it wouldn鈥檛 be cleared until 5 pm so wouldn鈥檛 be ready until 6 or 6:30 pm. Call back. Called back at 6:15 鈥?room ready bellhop would be there soon to help us with our luggage.At 7:30 鈥?after several calls, the last one was us inquiring as to whether the bellhop had gotten lost, we were in room 2351 鈥?second floor same building.NOTE: This was the first of many instances where the staff resist your request at first, then, if pressured, eventually do something. Their first impulse is to say 鈥渘o.鈥?Also, it is very difficult to get to speak to someone in authority. Another major problem was for staff to understand even the simplest EnglishRoom # 2 鈥?2351Our first impression - no bed table lamps 鈥?which were in 1354. Noisy A/C unit 鈥?but that wasn鈥檛 a problem. There was a coffee maker, but no coffeeThe safe lock didn鈥檛 work. A man came quickly but couldn鈥檛 open it. It took 3 men 2 hours, but they replaced mechanism and safe worked fine after.The balcony door lock didn鈥檛 lock and the switch that shuts off A/C when the door opens didn鈥檛 work.There were no robes 鈥?there were two in 1354. There were no wash cloths.The service very spotty 鈥?shampoo one day, not the next., towels one day, not the next, coffee one day, not the next., washcloths one day, not the next. .During our stay the bed was so poorly made we did it twice ourselves.On Sunday night at 11:30 we left the lobby and on the way out asked if the property was sprayed for mosquitoes. They said yes and asked our room number. When we got to room within 10 minutes, there was a man already spraying our entire room with repellent. It was so thick we felt it was unsafe to sleep there. We phoned the front desk, explained that it was unhealthy and unsafe to stay in the sprayed room, and asked for a bed for the night. Clerk said they had none, maybe tomorrow. So we said we鈥檒l sleep in the lobby. We went to the lobby, my wife sacked out on a sofa across from desk. The clerk was angry, but within 10 minutes he found us a room - Room 1033 鈥?much nicer. Manager told us later it was a Sol Melia timeshare room.On Monday we talked to guest services who were very helpful. We commend Ismail and Maria for making us feel they were indeed trying to help .We complained about the spraying, but it took another day to get to the manager. Nowhere does it say to complain to guest services. We dialled 0 with poor results.Finally on Tuesday we got to talk to the manager. He said we should have come earlier 鈥?he鈥檚 always available. However, it鈥檚 not easy to get the staff to contact him. . We had talked to him earlier on the phone about the drunk and he told us 鈥淲e can鈥檛 control the guests.鈥?But he can control what his staff does about them 鈥?the driver should have got the drunk out of his cab before he could annoy and endanger the guests. He said he had spoken to the driver about the incident and the driver felt the drunk was safest in the cab. Maybe, but we weren鈥檛 the safest! It would have been nice if he had closed the loop and told us that earlier. We would have felt better. He was very solicitous, but his main goal is to soothe the guest鈥檚 feelings, not to solve any problems with staff training or systemic issues. He said he would correspond with Sol Melia, the owners and that he would like to help us if we returned with our family.Our experiences were not unique 鈥?we talked to many other guests 鈥?virtually all had similar problems. An Edmonton couple were moved in from another resort 鈥?their two 2 children were housed in a separate .building! A German man, after an 11 hour flight, had to wait 1 陆 hours for room. A family needed two double beds for the four of them, but only had one bed 鈥?they were told to wait until next day. He said he wouldn鈥檛 wait. He got a good room near the beach.They had no towels in their room some daysEveryone else we asked had some complaints 鈥?many were minor, but all add up Two people who checked in at the same time as us got upgraded to Royal Service 鈥?but no phone cord. It took 3 days for their phone to work. When we asked the manager how people get upgraded, he said they did not have Royal Service. However, on the way home we reconfirmed with them that they were indeed in the Royal Service. At no time did he check to see if we were right. We were wrong in his eyes.The large groups who got moved in because other hotels were full got better rooms and in some cases upgraded. Our general impression was that of a somewhat run-down facility. Besides the swamp where the water breeds mosquitoes there was always casual water on some roads There were many mosquitoes and biting bugs. My wife got many very itchy bites that still bother her a lot. We talked to people from other resorts and they saw no mosquitoes. Last year at Ocean Blue we saw none..The grounds are beautiful and the staff in the restaurants are cheerful and helpful. The food in the restaurants is quite good. The pool is lovely. We do commend the restaurant worker who followed us and found us walking to our room to tell us that my wife had left her purse behind. For a 5-star resort, our experience was far removed. The rooms need work, the staff needs to be more customer oriented and more willing to correct things. The maids need to be more consistent in servicing the rooms. The pluses were far outweighed by the negatives we experienced. This is not anywhere near five star in our books.What a disappointment!

<Content>It was a Great Xmas Present fr my Husband! We booked the royal service with the butler. Was it worth the extra money, absolutely. We were checked in right away and the champagne, was flowing. My husband booked a garden view room and we lucked out into a ocean front room with a wonderful view of the beach. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. Three pools on the grounds, one was just for royal service, so it was semi private, same on the beach, there was a area with tiki huts and beds. All very nice. The water was a beautiful blue, and we never got tired of looking at it. Now, with the restaurants. There was 12 to pick from. There is something for everyone. Venti, (mediterranean) was awesome, we went there twice. The french, was good, but the portions were too small and we hit the buffet, on our way back to our room. The Steak house, the food was O.K. but the service Sucked big time, compared with the other restaurants. The lunch buffet was good, right on the beach. Great wines, and their house champagne was very nice too. On the whole, all the restaurants were fine, some better than others.. Make your dinner reservations for each night, as soon as possible.  Word of warning, they are a tad pushy with looking at their timeshares. They say it's a hr. of your time, but it was more like 2. We did get a $100. credit, out of the deal and a free room in the future, to use on their slow times, . My hubby used the credit for a massage. The time shares were very expensive in my eyes, I have two kids to put thru college, so we won't be buying one anytime in the near future. My husband gave this to me for Xmas and it was a great wk. to just relax, eat, drink and lay on the beach. Who could ask for anything more. Not me, But, I am asking for this same exact present for 2010, already have a cruise planned for 09.

<Content>Great place for relaxing and having fun We just spent a week at the Paradisus Punta Cana with two other couples. The resort is beautiful and the staff was always friendly. The grounds are huge, but there is a bus that travels through the grounds that you can hop on when it drives by.We normally spend a lot of time around the pool, but the beach was so beautiful we spent all but one day on the beach. They had great lounge chairs as well as huge mattresses that were great for catching an afternoon nap. We normally hit the pool late in the afternoon for a few drinks around the pool bar.The rooms had two queen size beds and then a few steps down to a sitting area with 2 love seats. Plenty of room and lots of closet space. Our room was cleaned and replenished everyday, plus turn down service at night.They had a great variety of restaurants and we never at at the buffet once for dinner. We recommend the Chinese, Japanese and Romantica restaurants. The food was good, and no one had any stomach problems. They tell you up front not to drink the water out of the tap in your room, but there is bottled water everywhere and our room fridge was restocked every day. The also have room service, which came in handy for late night pizza.The staff at the bars was always friendly and upbeat. The drinks were strong, especially late afternoon at the pool bar. There seemed to be live music somewhere everynight, or you could just find a quite lounge and visit.A lot of the staff did not speak English, but hey you are in their country, learn a little bit of Spanish and creative hand gestures we had no problem communicating.The guys golfed three days and said it was a great course - 27 holes. We walked down the beach to town one day - its a good hike. There is also a small shopping area about 1 block from the hotel entrance. There is a complementary bus that goes into town every two hours.It was a great trip and one of the better All Inclusives we have been to.

<Content>Excellent time at the Paradisus We stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana from 3/9-3/14. Stayed in a garden view Royal Service Suite. Arrival was quick and easy. We paid the $30 cab ride, and arrived at the Paradisus around 12. Our room wasn't ready, so we checked in at Royal Service and made dinner reservations for a few nights. We saw a sheet listing the resort as being 51-59% of capacity for the duration of our stay, so while we made the reservations figured we could change or do whatever we wanted if we had different things in mind. Room was ready by around 1. It was nice. Not great, but nice size and clean. Needed an update, but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Interestingly, I think we found exactly one mosquito flying around the room for the duration of the stay. Additionally, we never had ANY problem with bugs the whole week. Not even at the outdoor dinners, the walks back from the casino or reserve at night. etc/ And none of the people we spoke with had issues, either. I don't doubt at all that there have been the problems expressed on this site, but I want to stress that those problems are certainly the exception and not the norm. Excuse me if I jump around, but figured I'd just freelance our experience a bit. The beach was amazing. Never spent any time at the pool. The beds were super comfortable, the waiter service was pretty good (though always easier to walk up yourself to the bar). Spent a lot of time just walking up and down the beach aimlessly and reading our books under the hot sun that was always tempered by a nice breeze. Service overall was ok. Sometimes fantastic, sometimes mediocre. The better restaurants had better service, as well as a larger assortment of bilingual staff. Our Spanish is ok- we communicated fine with those who did not speak English, but it was of course easier when the waiter had at least the same working ability of english as we did of theirs. Food overall was good. Vento was excellent, we liked Gabi, Japanese good as well. The Italian was ok, but we were there for spaghetti and pizza and it hit the spot. Buffets just ok- food is fine, but we got tired of the same stuff. Not big drinkers, but the included wine was good enough for solid table wine at dinner and the mixed drinks were all good as well. Butler service in Royal was a joke. The girls at the desk in the lounge were way more helpful than our butler, who spent the whole week trying to get us to go on the vacation club tour. Never got us anything. His name was Lenin, and we didn't care much for him. Madeline and the other two women in the lounge were MUCH moe helpful. I like the breakfast buffet (fruit was a tad better and more attentive service for coffee, etc.) in the royal lounge, like the internet and papers. Was it worth the upgrade? I'd have to see the other rooms, but we got a good deal on the royal room so I didn't mind paying a few extra $. We saw a reserve room, and there is no comparison in quality. However...for those who like the beach the reserve is either a 10-15 minute walk or a shuttle ride away. Maid service was great every day but our last full day- when they forgot to clean at all. No big issue- we simply tracked her down and exchanged towels. Overall......the Dominican Republic is beautiful. The Paradisus is gorgeous as well, and the food is good to very good for all inclusive. Service lacks a little in relation to the other qualities, but considering the cost is lower than comparable places on other islands we were quite happy with the experience. Very much scared a week before going after reading some reviews on this site.....however we realized that the vast majority who have a fantastic time come home and don't bother with reviewing. A much larger percentage of those whose experiences are not so great will come here to share those opinions. One last note. I've been to many islands in the Carribean, and I find the Dominican people to be amongst the friendliest. Almost to a person they are happy and aim to please. I think the only reason service lacks is that they tend to be a bit green in high-end service, and expect that to improve vastly in the near future.

<Content>Beautiful HELL with Palm Trees! Upon arriving we were taken back by the beauty of the surroundings and our rooms. By the first morning after sleeping in this beautiful place our 4 and 6 year old were covered with bites! My husband and I also had bites although not as visciously as our children were attacked. I reported this to the concierge who had the sheets on the bed changed. We took brief showers and the shower doors leaked onto the marble floors while, although beautiful, were installed without thought of safety as upon exiting the shower they became an ice rink landing me onto my back and head. We had to throw all our towels onto the floor to make a path that would allow us to use the toilet. After 3 calls (the last of which I became adamant) a cleaning lady and 2 maintenance guys showed up....their answer was that they could see the problem with the door, so don't take any showers! By the second night we all had diarrhea and upset stomach from the absolutely average to terrible food! Also by the second night our children were completely covered with bites, so we moved them into our room to sleep with us. At least 6 people we spoke with at the pool were having the same experiences with food poisoning and bugs! I went to the hotel doctor, Doctor Junior, who informed me that he knew nothing of bites or rashes, but would write me a prescription as long as I paid for the physician's consultation as this was how he was paid by the hotel (even though he had no desire to see the children). He then tried to sell me a prescription for something my home pediatrician had never heard of and I could not read as the directions were in French and Spanish (I called the home doctor 2X at this point.) I called guest services 2X as I sat there(requesting a change in room), the doctor called them 1X, and each time they said they would call back in 2 minutes. Apparently they have no clocks in the Dominican, because they never did call back. I called the doctor at 2:30AM that night to inform him that he should come and look at the bugs I was swatting in the bed (leaving bloody marks all over the sheets.) He still insisted they were not bed bugs, but never did show up. I have some of the bug bodies in a baggie I've brought home. We paid a lot of money to have the concierge have someone run out and get Benadryl.....he claimed not to be able to get the liquid. The pediatrician at home was concerned on how we would be able the split the capsules in an appropriate manner for children, so we couldn't use them. The hotel manager acted like she was doing us some great favor giving us a $100 credit! She informed us that she had never credited anyone before. She also noted that you have to expect these things when you come to the islands! No lady, I do not! This is not a thatched hut on the corner of a swamp! It's not some cheap place! I have traveled all over the world, and have never come into contact with such a negative experience! Stay away from this filthy place! Spend your money elsewhere! There are plenty of reputable, wonderful places in the Carribean, and believe me....this is not one of them!!!!

<Content>ok but only jusr stayed here in 1999 and this time everywhere is far far busier, as expected. Beach is fabulous but crowded. We upgraded to Royal Service, not sure the extra we paid was fully worth it. True you do have the rooms with the best views but they are a little tired and need of renovation and certainly redecoration. The grounds are great as as the staff. The food was a little disappointing until we ate at the sister complex, the Reserve, far better here, ate there for 4 nights out of the 7. French, and seafood Rest. very disappoining. Also make sure you are fully aware of what is on offer as part of the fully invclusive - all water sports. there is also an inclusive wine list which they seem reluctant to give out!! Tghere is strange retro music throughtout the grounds, this grated after a while but that may be personal taste. One review did say the drinks were diluted, utter nonsense, they are always plentiful and too strong at times. Be aware of the activities in the main lobby and at the reserve, daily lists are simply not available and in the rooms there is no composite document of what the hotel has to offer. There is a great gym for use in the reserve but nothing is on hand to alert you to that fact!! Overall, location great and enjoyed our stay, Royal Service, not sure. The RS restauarant and private beach was welcomed but it came at a price. Its not what we call; 5 start in theUK but it was a good week.

<Content>Not exactly Paradise at the Paradisus After reading all the reviews  just returning from my stay there here is the bottom line:The good-- grounds are beautifuly landscaped  immaculate.-rooms are very nice  spacious-restaurant decor is very romantic and well decorated-Gabi bar on the beach is relaxing and very cool place to hang-beautiful beach- LOVE the Bali beds, plenty of lounge chairs in the sun and shade-great pool-had a great massage at the spaThe bad-- food is awful, I lost weight at the all inclusive due to not eating -service overall is not good unless you find a regular and tip them. -I know Americans are spoiled  expect everyone to speak English but just know most of the staff does not speak English- this is a problem if you do not speak Spanish.-Steam room at Spa did not work  the hot tub was not so hot-SCUBA diving is not great Be aware the DR is very international- you will see lots of topless women (many of which you would not want to see naked)  weenie bikins. We had no problem with bugs in our room but do take bug spray if you go to the beach at night. Overall, it is a nice resort but I will not return due to the service and food. If they could improve the quality of the food it would be an outstanding resort for the price. Just remember it is the class that it is which is not a 5 star hotel so don't expect the Four Seasons / Ritz treatment here.

<Content>wasn't impressed Ontario Canada Paradisus Punta CanaWe were not impressed with our resort . We arrived on Feb 16 08and stayed till Mar 01 08. We arrived late about 11.00 pm and was booked in fairly quick. We went to our room and found it not to bad, till we went to bed, the bed was so hard that we might as well slept on the floor. The next day we went up to see if we could get upgraded to Royal Service. We were told that they were all full . They told us to come back and check on Wed, (I would have thought they would contact us but no.) My husband and our friend went to check and they had 2 rooms avaliable for a fee of 170.00 extra per night (total of $2600.00 U.S for 2 people). We both took the room hoping for better rooms. We were moved to unit 19 on the bottom floor 1194. Our friends were moved to Unit 25 , 2nd floor 2255. We had 2 double beds put to-gether (huge) nice thick matterss, so we thought it was worth it to get a better bed for 2 weeks. Wrong the 2nd night in the bed my husband got bit about 50 times, the bites swelled and got infected. The bites happend under the sheets, the room was damp and musty our bed and pillows were always damp . We complained so they changed the sheets. the air conditioner leeked into the bath tub (they came and fixed it , next night the air conditioner leeked in the hallway to the bathroom all over the floor, my husband got up about 6.30 am to go to the washroom slipped in the dark and pretty near broke his neck. They came back and fixed it again . We complained about the bugs , wet beds, damp musty room. My husband had to go to the clinic for the bites , they said the bites where from mosqutios, but we didn't have but a few in our room, the doctor gave him 2 needles in the butt the first visit plus 2 differnt types of cream the first visit, the next visit another needle and a cleanser. The doctor was exellent but we know that they were bed bug bites. He was told not to go in the sun or in the water(what were we there for.) However we found the food to be not to bad have had a lot better, the grounds were beautifull although there was a lot of swamp area around.We complained to royal services about everything and 2 days before we left they moved us again into the new part called the Reserve where they tried to sell us timeshare. i would say a quarter of our time was spent moving, going to doctor, waiting to get things fixed in our room. I would never go back to this resort. We have been to Punta Cana 3 times before and never had these problems at the other resorts.

<Content>Good for a business meeting, not sure about a vacation My experience of the Paradisus was somewhat jaded by having flown in for a meeting after about 20 hours on planes (coming from New Delhi via Chicago and San Juan). The area was beautiful and the beaches appeared to come straight from a tropical daydream (white sand, clear emerald water, cobalt sky). The all-inclusive restaurants were good, although not great. The rooms were very well-appointed and clean, though musty. As striking as the surroundings were though, I must say that I didn't feel pampered as I wanted to. The front desk made me feel like one of the many tourists they had to deal with (which was true, but you don't like to be reminded of it in a luxury resort). I found it difficult to navigate the compound and the on-site shopping was disappointing. The nighttime entertainment was not well attended and felt put-on, which was the feeling I had about everything there in fact. I hope to return to the DR someday, but I may look elsewhere for a vacation spot.

<Content>Hotel needs improving.... Just got back from staying at the Paradisus... went from Feb 22-28...and have to say I was a bit disappointed with the hotel.It started with us arriving at the hotel late due to delays with the airline, once we got there, the lady behind the counter rushed us with the paper work, and didn't give us our bracelet for the property, which the next day, we were stopped twice by security.Good thing I guess about that was at least I knew security was watching out and making sure everyone walking around was indeed guests staying at the property.The grounds are beautiful and well kept, have to give them that.. it was nice to walk around and listen to the music which plays from the gardens.The room was nice, but plenty of mosquitos inside, turns out, when they clean your room, they do so with the door open, so definetely bring your bug spray!! you'll need it to for when you eat outdoors.Did have problems with house keeping, they're very lazy in that aspect, only once did they come in the morning and that was after we called to complain, all the other times was when they got around to it.. Restaurants were good, Vento and the french were the best, have to go to those...buffets had everything, from american food to food that the natives eat, so you really won't go hungry, but of course, remember you're not in the USA!! so don't expect top notch food! Service in the restaurants which you had to make reservations for was better than at the buffets.. they tend to see you sit there with no drinks, and have no problem just walk right by you.Beach was ok... found the water to be a bit rough so if you go with kids, be careful, was surprised, it had a decent under tow, so you had to be on guard with the water and its waves. The undertow pulled the sand from underneath and tended to make the water murky. The chair situation was a joke. If you were from Royal Service you had no problems, they had plenty of space for them, moreso than for the regular guests, I found that strange being that only about 1/4 of the rooms there are for Royal Service. At 10AM I went and walked around for a bit to find an empty chair to put under the palapa, they use palapa's instead of umbrellas, everyone tends to wake up super early and reserve chairs with towels.I went to see the new area that they have, its called the Reserve, its about 5 months old, very very nice area, with there own pool, and own restaurants. Is it worth the extra money? depends on you... the people that work there, definetely cater to you more and are A LOT more friendlier...walked around and everyone was saying hello, and smiling . Went to eat at Vento which is there and the service, food, atmosphere was top notch, couldn't say anything bad about it. AT the reserve, you have a different check in area, there own little golf carts which take you from place to place... for the beach, you have your own reserved area, which is only for them, with better ammenities, like better chairs, they have beds with pillows, waiter service, guys who come around taking your drink order... rooms are better as well, didn't get to see one, but heard they are more modern, with plasma TV's and other ammenities as well. again, is the x-tra money worth it? depends on you and your budget... if money wasn't too much of an issue I would definetely upgrade, its better service all around.Oh.. and check out, be ware... when you leave your room, make sure you take the security key from the safe with its big yellow looking thing, I guess you would call it the lock and key? anyways... had left the room with just the key.. thinking Im returning the key, good enough, but they made a huge stink about me not returing the yellow lock thing, they didn't let us check out, even as our transfer to the airport had arrived and was waiting for us, they had called security to go to our room to double check and needless to say after 20 minutes of everyone arguing with each other, the transfer guy is yelling at us saying he was going to leave us, I had to run back and retrieve it myself, where was the security guard who had gone to my room? who knows, perhaps still on its way...All in all, the overall experience was ok... the grounds was beautiful but the people that work there need to greatly improve there customer service skills, in order to give the client a better experience, I speak spanish and that still didn't give me any better advantage. If I had to chose a Paradisus property, hands down I would pick the one in Riviera Maya.

<Content>No Royal Treatment We traveled to Paradisus Punta Cana for our Honeymoon in January. We booked an Oceanfront room with Royal Service. We were told that we would be waited on hand and foot only to be very disappointed time and again, even though generous tips were given to the employees. We were supposed to have a personal butler to take care of all our needs including filling our mini bar with personalized contents. My husband and I went to the office several times to request items that were never brought to our room. Our last night there, we had them prepare a jacuzzi (which was part of our Royal Serivce) and had asked for champagne to be delivered. We arrived back to the room only to find our key no longer worked and then after walking back to the office to change the key, found that they had prepared the jacuzzi but there was no champagne. This was typical of the service we received all week. The bartenders were very nice but the drinks were all watered down and weak. Also, there was not much to speak of for night life around the resort either. The staff was friendly and respectful, just not very helpful. Beautiful resort, but very overcrowded. No secluded places for couples even though we were in a special area for Royal Service guests where it was supposed to be adults only. This last point may not matter to some, but we would not have chosen this resort or beach had we been told by our travel agent that it was a top optional beach. Extremely expensive and not worth it. Would not go back again.

<Content>Worst Ever Food poisoning, bed bugs and pushy, disrespectful management is what we got at Paradisus Punta Cana. So, here is my review, forwarned is forarmed.My family and I traveled to the Dominican Republic last week (February 16-23) for the second time in 4 years. This year we stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana which is owned by Sol Melia. I made our reservations in November 2007 and carried with me the e-mail confirmation dated November 29, 2007.Upon arrival (3 PM Saturday), we were told by management there were no more rooms. We had friends traveling with a tour group,arriving later who received rooms. (The tour groups are too valuable to anger I guess) The hotel had overbooked, insisted there were no rooms and sent us off along with some other families to a less expensive, inferior hotel 20 minutes away, then brought us back the next day. On the second day our friend got sick from the food but recovered the next day. On the fourth day my wife got food poisoning and was violently ill and feverish for 24 hours and felt poorly the remainder of the week. The room was often cleaned late (and not very well), and one day was not cleaned at all, until we requested they come and tidy up while we were at dinner. By the end of the week I was getting bug bites on my legs and arms and upon returning home it was determined to be bed bug bites.I have to warn all who read this to consider our worst ever experience and ask you to tell others who may be considering this hotel/resort.

<Content>Can't wait to go back We booked the Paradisus thru the Melia Vacation Club which made it very reasonable. My cousin owns a time share through them so we reimbursed her for the $500 maintenance fee for her week and only had to pay the all inclusive fee when we got there which was about $1200. We have stayed in many all inclusives around the Carribean and this was the best ever. We were so pleased that we booked another week for next year. The grounds were beautiful and our room was near the beach. The room furniture was a little shabby and the bed and pillow not as comfortable as I would have liked, but that about sums up the negatives.We had breakfast every morning in the buffet restaurant Hybiscus and the food was great with an omelet station, fresh fruit shake station, hot food buffet and continental buffet. We had everything from smoked salmon with cheese to bacon with waffles.Lunch at the Hybiscus was also good, with the grill preparing fresh fish, chicken or lamb chops. There was also a carving station and I tried the braised Ox which turned out to be the best roast beef I ever had. We also had lunch at the grill where you can pick out your fish and they will grill it for you with garlic and oil-delicious. We also had lunch at the Italian restaurant which was the only ala carte lunch place. They served an unbelievable tuna carpacio over arugala. The pasta with pesto was good too, but I think they just went to the buffet and got it from the pasta station.For dinner the best restaurant was the new one called Vento which is near the lobby. The service and food were excellent. I recommend the squid in black ink sauce and the veal osso bucco. We stopped for a drink at the Gabi lounge each night before dinner and that worked out well as it had a sophisticated ambiance and it was right next to the beach. We met people from Montreal and Germany.El Romantico was excellent on the main course-the fillet minion I ordered was tender and well prepared. However the side dishes were not as described on the menu and a little disappointing. However there was a violinist playing as we dined and that was lovely.We skipped the Chinese as people we met on the shuttle told us they were sick after eating there.We tried the Japanese restaurant and the sushi was excellent. The main dish was cooked hibachi style with a chef cooking at our table of 12 people. It was OK.The Brazilian restaurant was notable for the Chorizo sausage which was outstanding. Do try the three sauces with the various meats it was fun.Reservations were needed for Vento, El Romantico, Sakura (the Japanese) and Albufera. Albufera is the steakhouse next to Hybiscus. The staff didn't speak English at all and didn't understand our Spanish. The t-bone steak was tough, but the filet mignion was tender.The last restaurant I'll tell you about was the seafood. At night the grill next to the beach turns into an ala carte seafood restaurnant (no reservations needed). The beach in moonlight with a gentle breeze was gorgeous. We ate there twice it was so good. Our favorites were a shrimp casserole which was basically shrimp grilled in oil, garlic with a little hot pepper. We also like the ceviche and found that it was fun to alternate a bite of hot shrimp with a bite of cold ceviche - Heaven. Our entree here was the grilled lobster and we asked for a bowl of hot butter to dip into.At all the restaurant we ordered bottlesof wine and champagne. We particularly like the white wine from France and the red wine from Spain. The bars had a variety of top shelf liquor but not any kind of rye whisky that my husband likes -Crown Royal or Jamesons. No Seagram Seven either.The beach had as many lounge chairs as you could want and they hotel was full as this was presidents week. However, the beds were in high demand and you had to go out early to reserve one with your towel, magazine and hat. The beds were the size of a double bed with a 6 inch thick mattress which propped up. My husband went golfing and the course was very nice but moved slowly because it was crowded. So a round took 5 hours. The last shuttle leaves the golf course at 6:15 and he almost missed it as no one had explained this. Also you cannot charge the cost of the cart to the room, so bring money or a charge card or you will be turned away.I'dbe glad to provide any other info as I like remembering this excellent vacation.

<Content>Beautiful  Vacationed feb 8th--15th 2008..... Upon arrival, we quickly got out of the airport with a mandatory $10 enter the country fee, and our passports stamped.....luggage put in our Apple Tours van with another couple, and within minutes we were off on our way to our hotel....it`s 30-35 minutes to our hotel, with a brief stop for the other couple.........upon arriving a staff member took us over to check-in and took care of our check in for us.....then took us to the lobby bar for a quick drink while he was explaining the hotel info...we then took our luggage in a golf cart type vehicle, quickly by the beach and then to our room........which was located in beautiful building #7......Our room was a beautiful and clean room, with great air conditioning and a king sized bed, a small t.v. with 2 or 3 american channels, the rest in spanish.......refridgerator was so so.....cooler by putting drinks up top......write the maid's a couple little words like cerveza y agua por favor....which means beer and water please.....and we got a 4- pack of their beer and 6 to 8 water bottles....we left a tip each day........You will need to brush your teeth with bottled water, do not drink their tap water!.......Our favorite bars were the lobby bar, and swim up bar. The lobby bar had nightly live music.....and if you didn`t want to sit at the bar......there were sofa`s and swinging seats close by..........There was live entertainment shows nightly, starting around 10pm.......in a nicely air conditioned room near the lobby bar, where you could bring your drink too.........we thought the entertainment was just average.....and often stayed about 15 minutes.......of the hour shows.........the ocean and the beach were excellent......plenty of lounge chairs and beds, the beds were SOOO comfy. People do tend to reserve chairs on beach around 8am by leaving their towels on chairs..........but we never had much trouble locating 2 chairs even at 10am......ocean was a bit rough, but not a problem...........lots of fun playing in the waves. Main pool is super too......with a nice swim up bar......aerobics by pool bar around noon each day........live music poolside once or twice.....Only bummer is the pool closes at 6 pm. You can get free cigarettes at any bar........sometimes a free cigar. The beach massage was awesome...lovely ocean breeze and the sounds of the crashing waves added to the relaxation. If you sign up for horseback riding, be aware the ride is about an hour in an open air (no top) truck, rough roads and blazing sun...but the horseback ride was worth it. We went running through the edge of the waves...really cool. Just be prepared for a 3 to 4 hour outing for a one hour ride. The food was good everywhere, except the steak house, La Albufera. The setting was beautiful and the service good, but our steaks were way over cooked, small portions. The Brazilian restaurant, La Palapa, was excellent. Carved the food right onto your plate...very good. The Japanese was really good...you share a table with others as they cook for 12 at a time, but it was fun and delicious....moved to another table for dessert, we had fried ice cream...really good. The newest restaurant, Vento, was wonderful. We had dinner there on Valentine's Day, and they handed out red roses to the women. The food was excellent, the service was superb and dessert was exquisite! We had a bottle of champagne. We loved it. The Chinese was suprisingly good. We enjoyed the buffet at Hybiscus, especially for breakfast. The local beer, Presidente, was good. They also had Heineken. The liquor was not cheap, quite good as a matter of fact. A little tipping goes a long way at the bars...your glass will never be empty if you tip. They will try to get you to listen to a vacation club/timeshare pitch, but we were able to get out of it. Just say no...that's what we did. Our conceriege, Tony, took a group of us on a party boat which was a blast. It was about a 20 min ride from the hotel in an air conditioned bus...took a little boat out to the bigger boat....beer and rum and coke...music...then we anchored for swimming, played a drinking game in the water with our conceriege...what a blast! When we got back on the boat the men were teaching the women how to dance, Dominican style! It was really fun.There is transportation around the resort, but you can get just about anywhere in a 10-15 minute walk...the stone walkways are very nice and have good lighting at night. We only used the transportation 2 or 3 times all week. The grounds are beautiful, and the staff were working all the time to keep it that way.If you need to extend your check out time, let the front desk know 24 hrs ahead...suggest you do it...we spent a few hours in the lobby with our luggage waiting for our ride to the airport...we sure would have loved another hour or two on the beach or in the pool!The weather was perfect....about 85 during the day, 75 at night. Humidity was not bad....clear blue skies, sun....wonderful breeze most of the time. We got up for sunrise 2 or 3 times, and it is worth it...absolutely beautiful. They rake the beach every morning, and it is spotless...no shells, but soft white sand.

<Content>Posh Resort This trip started out very rocky. When we arrived my best friend and I with my father, we were told that there was only one room available for an undetermined amount of time. Thankfully it was only for the night and besides that minor glitch the week was amazing. Beautiful beach and pool. Amazing food. Older crowd though, we were 18 and there were definitely not very many teenagers there that spoke English although we did make friends. The nightlife on the resort is almost non-existent. The lobby bar shuts down at midnight and people move into the Fun Pub which never had more than 15 people in it at once. Other than that it was great service and a beautiful resort that I would definitely go back to.

<Content>Paradise at Paradisus Myy wife and I just got back and it was great. Here is a quick review of our experience.1. Reserve SectionTry to get in reserve section of hotel Rooms, pool, bar and restaurant less crowded and better service. Those in reserve section are aloud to use all facilities but only reserve members can use reserve area. Food, pool, restaurant, bar all better due to less people. Really try to get this section. All newer.2. RoomsWe got a bigger room with seperate bedroom and living area. Big bathroom and living area. Bring clock because none in bedroom. Don't use room service because of english barrier.3. RestaurantsAll great. Food really good. At Gabbi restaurant in 'reserve section had lobster and caviar along with other great food selections. Favorite restaurants were El Romantico, Ventom and steak house. Need reservations. Get 9:00 seating and show up at 8:30 for seating. It will be available and you get to enjoy more of day. Otherwise they will offer 6;30 seating. You'll still be full from lunch.4. PoolGreat at reserve and less crowded. Atmosphere awesome. Lots of places to sit and relax. Has swim up bar.5. GolfWe picked this place because of free golf. Plan on losing 6 hours of vacation time. Have to shuttle to course which is aprox 20 min ride. Course really nice and you should play at least once. Cost $35 per person for cart. Crowded and don't forget voucher hotel gives you or they will send you back to hotel to get. We took attitude that can play at home and spend less time doing while can't go to beach this time of year at home!6. BeachLots chairs available. Nice water and waves. Get to beach at 9:00 and grab your chair than go to breakfast. If wait until 11:00 have hard time finding chair.7. TippingBring some $1's and $5's for tipping. Believe me no one refuses a tip. Invest in regular bar tendors and servers. They will remember and take care of you. 8. EntertainmentWeak and not worth watching. Only good thing was shows are short. Lots of people walked out. Dancing in Lobby area after show very enjoyable and well attended.9. HotelAwesome. Great decorations and easy to check in and out. Everyone very helpful.10. BugsSome mosquitos around that will bite. Not as bad at beach due to breeze. Bring bug spray. We didn't but will next time.11. BarTop shelf liquor to include single malt scotch and any and all top shelf after dinner drinks. Johnny Black, Stoli, Bombay etc. You won't be dissappointed with choices. All in all a great experienc and we will return. Best most relaxing vacation I've had in long time

<Content>A place to just, relax....well not quite. My boy's and I had the chance to visit the DR this past winter during their Spring Break. After reading some reviews here, and talking to some friends, we decided to visit Paradisus. The hotel is about 30min from the airport and on the southern coast. It is situated in a very lush tropical setting and the grounds are beautiful.We arrived around 6pm and waited over an hour to check into the hotel. While there seemed to be plenty of hotel staff, they were really not focused on taking care of the guests as they arrived.After a lot of confusion we were taken to the Family Conceirge to check in, and they too were a bit confused and unorganized. Eventually, we were given our rooms but the confusion did not stop there. One of the rooms was occupied by another guest, who was suprised to see 3 boys appear at their door at 900p!! We moved into one room, while the Conceirge went to figure out where the other room was. About an hour later they found a room to use for one night in another part of the hotel. It was almost 1030p before this was ever resolved. The next day we had to move to another set of rooms that were adjacent to each other. We had an all inclusive meal plan which was very convenient for all of us. The downside is that you are pretty much locked into eating within set times, and there are no late night places to get a snack or late dinner. The restaraunts are not the resorts strong point, in fact they are all fairly average, the one exception is the one that is on the beach and open for lunch - this one had a pretty good buffet in a nice setting on the beach. The pool is very nice, but you need to claim your spots early in the morning to be assured being close to the pool. The beach is also very nice, good surf, nice wide beaches. This too requires a little advance scouting to claim chaises etc in the early am.If sleeping on the beach/pool and completely relaxing due to a lack of activities is not your thing. You will need to get off the property. The lobby had quite a few services geared toward scuba diving, snorkling with sharks (more of a booze cruise), atv's etc I used the gym, it was very small for a resort of this size, but if you hit it at the right time you had the place to yourself.For us it was nice to get away and spend time together, but I would not return to Paradisus. The restaurants need to improve, the room decor could use an update/refreshening and the hotel staff was just a bit to unorganized for my taste.

<Content>Fabulous Vacation Spent a week at Paradisus Punta Cana end of Jan. beginning of Feb. and absolutely loved it and would highly recommend. A friend and I stayed in the new Reserve section and it was fabulous. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and the service was great. We never did see the rooms in the main section, so I cannot comment on those, but ours was very very nice, with lots of extras.Our concierge was fairly new, but very helpful and eager to assist us, although we did not really use his service often. When we did ask for something, we got it in a timely fashion. I worked in the airline industry for many years and have traveled extensively around the world, and found Punta Cana and the this hotel to be way above average.We had a separate pool at the Reserve which was a smaller version of the main pool. We went to both pools and the beach and there were always chairs available. (People did tend to hold unoccupied chairs for a long time and some times we had to look for a couple of minutes, but always found something in the sun.) The beach was very clean and beautiful sand, and we were not bothered by vendors. (There were a few on the beach, but if you just shook your head no, the moved on.)I did the water aerobics a couple of days, which was fun. We went horseback riding twice in the morning and it was great. The portion on the beach was at least half or more of the ride and you were allowed to walk or run your horses depending on your comfort zone. My friend went snorkeling and said it was really good. We both went on the afternoon boat excursion which was nice and gave us an opportunity to meet some different people. I went to the spa on the last evening and my masseuse was excellent and the facility was very nicely done. We also went to several of the shows which were entertaining. There were more included activities then anyone could take advantage of and we went mostly to beach and relax.We went to most of the restaurants and everywhere the food was above average and beyond. We returned our last night to Gabbi as it was our favorite. I would recommend the Brazilian restaurant to anyone who would like the flavor of a real churrascaria in Brazil. Plan to spend at least an hour or two because the way food is served is different than a traditional restaurant, but like it was when I was in Rio and went to churrascarias there.Overall, it was a wonderful, relaxing vacation and I would return and recommend to others.

<Content>Great place to relax We arrived at the Paradisus Punta Cana with another couple on January 19 and were checked in immediately. Because I own a timeshare in the Melia Vacation Club, we were assigned to building 4, which is close to the beach, pool, and restaurants. There are 3 buildings with timeshare units and they are buildings 2, 3 and 4. We also met up with more friends of ours which arrived mid-week. Overview: The Paradisus Punta Cana is part of the Sol Melia chain of resorts located in Punta Can along Bavaro Beach. It is an all-inclusive resort, which I believe is now optional. But, they have no payment system and not many restaurants in the area. The fees are $89/pp/d for an adult, half of that for children under 12. It states it has 500 units, but this year they have added a new section called the Reserve which is geared toward families with its own pool and play area. There have been a lot of changes over the past year with the addition of the reserve area, closing of the small animal park, opening of a new business area and relocation of the casino. There are 9 restaurants and several bars with top shelf liquor. The grounds are impeccably maintained and beach is absolutely pristine with lots of palapas for shade and many chaise lounges on the beach and around the pool. The business area is near the entertainment area, down a hallway and costs $12 for 1 hour of time which was valid for 5 days. They can print for you, but it is $1/page for black and white, $2 for color. You can also rent laptops, but I can鈥檛 remember the cost per day.Units: Each building has 16 units; 8 on each floor, which consist of either 2 queens or a king sized bed, a sitting area, and balconies with a garden view. The units are studios equipped with a safe, microwave, coffeepot, toaster, table service for 4, and refrigerator stocked with soda, water and, on request, beer. There is daily maid service with occasional turn down service. I say occasional because they only did it occasionally! Since last year they have updated the bedding and acquired new sofas, but they really need new refrigerators. They get cold, but only after a long while. There may be some tiny bugs, but that doesn鈥檛 bother us, they don鈥檛 bite and are usually there when the maids bring in flowers.Beach: The beach has soft white sand and some surf with no seaweed and/or sea grass. There is some surf, at least in the winter time, so you would have to be careful if traveling with small children, but for adults it鈥檚 fine. There is no bar service on the beach unless you stay with the Royal Service section. There is an extra cost for this. Food: The taste and quality of the food is quite subjective, but everyone in our party and the people that we met, all loved it. I have to say we really didn鈥檛 have a bad meal for the entire stay. We ate at the Hibiscus every morning, and they had made to order omelets and eggs, along with various meats, cheeses, and assorted other breakfast items, such as, pancakes, French toast, and waffles. Usually 3-4 different juices and lots of fruit are in the buffet area also.The different types of restaurants consist of a Brazilian, French, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Dominican, seafood, a steak house, and another in the reserve section I did not go to. They closed the Mexican due to relocation of the casino. Some of these need reservations, so check which ones and make the reservations when you arrive.They also have 24 hour room service, which comes pretty quickly.Water: One word of caution鈥o not drink the water or use it to make coffee or brush your teeth! All water is bottled, including what they use in the restaurants. We have brought down many people over the years and no one has ever been sick following these simple rules. We all eat salad and fruit daily and no one has gotten sick from itService: Because we are creatures of habit, we usually went to the same places each day and had wonderful service. I will say that our maid was wonderful!! But, on her days off, we had another who was terrible; she just about made the bed!Pool: Awesome pool, no deeper than 5 ft, and is so large, it never is crowded, well maybe sometimes near the bar! There are some areas for children where they can play and it is not deep. There are also some tiled areas where you could rest in the pool where the water is only a few inched deep. Activities: I can鈥檛 comment on these because we really didn鈥檛 do anything but relax. They do have a children鈥檚 area, a rock climbing area, some pool tables, ping-pong, bikes, volley ball net in the pool and on the beach, tennis courts and some water sportsWe go there every year and have never been disappointed, but then we are just there to relax and sit by the beach. If you are accustomed to 5 star services, then I鈥檓 sure you will find something to complain about as it is not 5 star like in the States. It is clean and beautiful and relaxing!!

<Content>Truly Paradise! My husband and I just returned from a week's stay in the Royal Service portion of the Paradisus. Our stay was perfect in every way! The staff was friendly and fulfilled every request promptly. We had breakfast each morning in the Royal Service dining room. Lunch was offered by the staff on the beach. Each night we went to a different restaurant. We tried the Dolce Vita (our favorite), Albufera, Marino, Hybiscus, and Sakura (not as good as we had hoped).Our room was beautiful with a view of the Royal Service Pool area. Housekeeping was exceptional, leaving small gifts each day for us.We tipped generously because we found the service so exceptional.We would highly recommend this resort.

<Content>Don't bother! Resort is beautiful but service was awful. People can't be trusted. Money was stolen out of my locker during a massage. The hotel mistakenly charged us twice but then expected us to leave without a receipt for the $9000 credit. Hotel employees do not know where anything is or how to find activities. We paid extra for family concierge who never returned our phone calls. She didn't book us for activities that she said she would book us for and we only found out shortly before the activity started. Nothing is as advertised - casino was under renovation and nature trail was closed. SAVE YOUR MONEY and go to Mexico or another island. Areas outside the resort are not safe so there's nothing to do but stay on the resort where you really can't count on the help to make your stay nice!

<Content>1st time's a charm!!!!!!! I just retuned from my trip to this hotel and i have to say.... it was the most beautiful hotel i've stayed in. It was beautiful and was big. The pool was magnificent and the drinks were tasty too. The retaurants had really good food. The best place to try is the brazilian restaurant rodizzio....amazing food and very friendly staff.....The room could be updated a little and the beach water was rough, but those were the only flaws.

<Content>We're going back again I don't normally write reviews but I read some of the others and felt compelled to say something. Alot of the bad stuff people wrote was in my opinion unfair. My wife and I went there on our honeymoon last year and we loved it so much we are going back again this year. The grounds are beautiful, the atmosphere is VERY relaxing and the hospitality is unsurpassed. Does it take a little longer to check in than say if you were checking in to the Holiday Inn in Atlanta? Yes, but hey you're in the Dominican Republic. Relax! Isn't that what you are there for?The pool is one of the most scenic I have ever seen. I love the fact that each bungalo has its own private porch where you can sit and enjoy a cigar and a cup of coffee (you are in the caribbean after all) and watch the gekos scury about. One of the hotels most enchanting features is the fact that it really isn't a hotel in a traditional sense. Each unit is a block of 4-8 bungalos. The food is very good. There are some resturants on site that do require reservations so you may want to make them early. They have just about every variety of food you could be in the mood for. The biggest problem is deciding what you want to eat that day. My only advise, bring some insect repellant because there are mosquitos but again, you are in the tropics and they aren't THAT bad. Relax and enjoy, we will be going there over and over again.

<Content>Great All Inclusive for money We took a group of 14 to the resort and had a terrific experience. The resort is very well taken care of and the rooms are very nice. I would rank this a 4 out of 5. POSITIIVES:Beautiful grounds, very nice accomodations, people were very friendly and helpful. Food for an all inclusive was top notch. We loved that there were very few Americans. Mostly Russians and Latin Americans.NEGATIVESNeed more wine selection- cheap wine for all inclusive. Buffets were okay the best restuarants requirred RSVP and we could not get a RSVP for our stay. Book in advance! Room service was not good. The Spa is very very small and services were average.

<Content>Beautiful but not perfect My husband and 2 children ages 8 and 9 stayed here last April over Spring Break. First off I have to say that I have been to several resorts in the Carribean and this one is the most beautiful. The grounds are gorgeous and impeccably kept. The pools are beautiful and the beach unbeatable. The rooms were small but they were kept very clean every single day and we spent very little time in the room. The restaurants were mostly good but nothing truly outstanding. The first night we went to the Seafood restaurant and it was very good, then on the last night we went again and the lobster was just awful (undercooked and chewy) I noticed several diners did not eat their lobster that night. The dress code was annoying for the men. Really anything goes for the women except a bathing suit, but most of the restaurants did require pants for the men. This is bad when it's 80 degrees humid and open air dining. No real stomach problems just my son had a slight bout of diarrhea.The swim up bar was fun but I was dissappointed that they did not have any good mixers. They use a tang type drink for orange juice, a watered down punch in place of cranberry and no grapefruit juice. I thought this was very strange. The service was very good and the bartenders were also very nice to the kids making them virgin mudslides, pina coladas or whatever, and they never treated the kids as annoyances.The kids club (is not), basically a run down place with some old board games. They did have some organized water volleyball which my son loved but that was really it for the kids. However the pool was great for the kids. They have a blow up rock climbing wall which my kids spent hours on. One thing I will say about the pool was that I do think the water gets dirty with drinks spilling and oil build up. My son and I had ear problems almost the entire time we were there, being plugged and painful (and we never have before from swimming). I would recommend flushing ears every night with hydrogen peroxide to keep ahead of this.We went on a snorkeling excursion and they piled a very unsafe amount of people into a boat and headed out to sea in very choppy water and then dropped us at a corral reef. Nothing great to look at here, it does not come close to snorkeling in Aruba or Cancun, I do not recommend this trip.The weather was sunny every day and oppressively humid. Bathing suits do not dry here and drink as much water as you can. The people were so friendly but the language barrier is very difficult to overcome. We had a lot of trouble communicating. We just found out what we needed to know from other vacationers. By the way the other vacationers were awesome and we made a lot of friends while we there.All in all a beautiful place but very expensive.

<Content>Could Use Some Work Went to Punta Cana last April with my fiancee as the relaxing leg of a ski'n'surf trip (we started in Whistler BC, went to San Fran to visit friends of my fiancee, then went to the DR after a stop back home in NYC). Booked the Royal Service - a Deluxe Junior Suite with Jacuzzi. When we arrived at the hotel, we'd just beaten a major afternoon downpour. As others have mentioned, to check into the royal service, they have to truck you out to the royal service check in area, which is a short five-minute drive from the main building. By the time we'd waited 20 minutes for someone to take us out there, it was pouring, so we hopped onto a tarp-covered and soaking wet passenger cart and sped through six inch deep pools of water trying to keep at least our top-halves dry by holding the plastic down as we went. They can't control the weather, but they could do better in keeping people dry. Frankly, the whole idea of a separate check-in may be exciting for some, but I'd rather arrive and be shown right to my room to settle in - I can get oriented later.We sloshed into the royal service check in area and were met with blank stares when we told them the name on our reservation - when booking through Orbitz or another online agency, make SURE you print out your voucher. Fortunately, I had my blackberry and was able to show them our reservations - telling them our reservation number wasn't good enough, and I'm fairly convinced they would have thrown us out if we hadn't shown them the email. After an hour of checking in (much of it waiting for someone to pay attention to us, then for our room to be ready), we also booked some reservations at a couple of the restaurants for the next few days (we'll return to that later).Back into the rain and to our soaking transportation, all the way across the property to a room on the far side. The room was large, damp, cold and uncomfortably furnished. The bed was hard and there was only a thin polyester blanket and some worn sheets, which were as damp as the rest of the room. It didn't have an electronic safe, so I asked the porter to bring a lock for the old-fashioned safe to put away our valuables - it arrived the next night (after a complaint in the morning) and a second lock arrived the next morning (more on that later).For kicking back and relaxing during the day, it was wonderful - We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at the royal service dining room. The royal service pool and beach were clean and relaxing, and the bartenders were generally very friendly. I should note that there are a lot of smokers at and near the pool bar - I used to smoke regularly and still sometimes smoke on vacation, so it didn't bother me, but I'm sure others will be turned off by that.We hit the gym one day, which was decently appointed and had mostly working machines and a reasonable selection of free weights. We also scheduled time on the tennis courts and had a good time hitting some balls around - the guys tending the courts were extremely friendly.I've waited too long to remember all of the details of our dinner fiascos (plural), but the gist of it is that we called on our first evening to change our reservation for the following day and were confirmed. That day we were supposed to receive a reservation voucher to bring to the restaurant - by the time we got back to our room that evening, it was nowhere to be found. We called to complain and were told they didn't have any record of our reservation (neither our original one nor the new one). We trekked over to the royal service area to complain and, lo and behold, were met with blank stares again. The worst thing is that the staff doesn't apologize and try to make things right, they just get defensive. The only thing we ever heard from them was We have no reservation for you - you have to reserve in advance, you can't just call right before. Even that would have been ok, if they had just prefaced it with an I'm sorry, but that was something we didn't hear the entire time we were there. I'm a pretty nice guy - my fiancee makes fun of me because I don't complain and I overtip even for bad service. Perhaps I wasn't forceful enough, but I have to say that on the day we checked out the guy at the next desk was virtually screaming at them (after a half hour of fairly calm arguing) and got basically the same reaction I got with my calm explanations that they had screwed up. Finally, as a consolation prize, they gave us a 6-ish reservation for the restaurant (the Japanese place) for the following night, and we clearly only got that because someone else had cancelled - still no apology. All that said, we should have avoided the finer dining places altogether. The Japanese place, as I'm sure others have noted, is a Benihana style joint that is basically fried rice and teriyaki. I'm a pretty huge sushi fan, but I have to say that you should stay far away from the terrible sushi - if you've ever had sushi before, it will be upsetting - if you've never had sushi before (as many at our table had not), it will make you wonder what kind of lunatic would ever eat the stuff. We cancelled our reservation at the French place, as we heard pretty terrible things about that as well. My suggestion for food is to stick with the latin themed places - the Mexican and Brazilian joints were both perfectly good and exactly what we expected. No surprises and a better selection.The bar near the royal service pool was lovely at night - softly lit, not crowded but full enough to have a nice hum about the place and lots of laughter. The Casino was a little depressing - bright fluorescent lights and a few tables, each with a couple of people who were a little too serious about their gambling considering the setting.We only went to one entertainment event, in the restaurant area/indoor bar down by the beach. It was a little odd to say the least. It was kind of a rave atmosphere - i can't remember what the theme was - but it had a sort of depraved thing going on. There were female go-go dancer types on raised platforms and an oiled and well-muscled man in nothing but a speedo, roller skates and sunglasses roller-dancing through the joint and grabbing delighted middle-aged women to dance with. The strangest thing was that there were all these kids there, ranging from 10 to maybe 16 years old - people had brought their families down for a little entertainment, and the kids were dancing around in strobe lights next to these grinding, provocatively dressed staff members. Thinking back to when I was 13 or 14, I probably would have thought it was pretty awesome to dance around with a bunch of hot, scantily clad dominican women, but at 30 (which was pretty young as adults at that place went) this was just surreal and disturbing. Clearly there were parents there - some were dancing with their kids. I'll confess I had fun just watching the strange scene, and I'm sure many of the more traditional shows with musical numbers, etc. are more appropriate for the families and seniors who are the majority of the guests.Finally, we checked out (we stayed 3 nights). We asked to have our bags brought around and to close out our bill. Here we come back to that matter of the safe lock. I left the lock attached to the safe with the key in it and the safe open - the other lock and key I placed inside the safe. As we are waiting for our luggage at the front of the resort, I'm told that they can't check me out because there is still a charge on our tab that needs to be taken care of. I ask what the problem is, and they say that I left the safe lock in my room and I need to confirm that I have taken everything out of the safe and retrieve the lock, then sign a release. If I don't, ,they'll have to remove the lock (?) and charge me for both locks (?). I tell them that I took everything ouf ot the safe, left it open intentionally, and left the key there. They are welcome to take the lock, and I will sign the release, but I will not pay them for the lock, as they have it and the key. The head of security is paged and, after a 20 minute wait, tells me that's not good enough. I have to go back to the room and confirm that there's nothing left. After arguing about it and agreeing again to sign the release, I'm told its not enough - I'm a lawyer, and while I'm not fluent in Spanish or DR law, the release had an English translation and unless DR law is crazy, the release would have completely covered them for liability if i left something behind. Finally, I agree to go to the room, I get on the back of the security chief's scooter, schlep all the way to the room, look at the safe, take out the lock and hand it to the security chief, sign the release, and schlep back to my waiting fiancee. Thank god we planned to get to the airport very early, because this would potentially have made us miss our flight if we had let if get much closer.So, if you've read this far, you're probably asking how I can even give the place two stars. Answer? If I knew what it was going in, i probably wouldn't have found the experience so frustrating. You need to go there expecting very little and you'll probably come away with a much better experience, both objectively and subjectively. Plan to go and sit on the beach or by the pool, eat Mexican or Dominican food, and try not to rely on the property to do anything for you. If you can do that and get a good deal on price, it will be fine. The setting is lovely, the people are (for the most part) friendly, and there's free food and drink. Good enough, I'd say.

<Content>Wow!!!! My wife and I (both in our 40's and we live in Florida) stayed at the gorgeous Paradisus Punta Cana for 5 glorious days in January 2008. Wow!!! Gorgeous is an understatement. The grounds are beautiful - this resort is eco-friendly and it feels like a manicured jungle - the landscaping is top-notch. Very tropical. The beach is Bavaro Beach and is the best location on the Dominican Republic. We walked up and down the beach several times and we knew we made the right decision by choosing the Paradisus Punta Cana. The ocean has nice waves, there are always cooling winds, the water temperature was 80 degrees, the color of the water is turquoise, the sand is golden and the beach area in front of the hotel is loaded with comfy beds underneath thatched umbrellas to protect against the sun. We didn't notice any seaweed or sea grass either. Daytime temperatures were 82 degrees and nighttime temperatures were 70 degrees. Perfect!!!! We didn't get the Royal Service and didn't see what the hoopla was. Do yourself a favor and save your money on the Royal Service. There were many restaurants on the property - the French restaurant was the best, the others mostly average. My wife and I both got Montezuma's revenge (or is it Taino's revenge?) for one day each which was a bummer but we didn't let it stop us. Nighttime entertainment was very average. The pools were beautiful. The spa was also very nice. Our bungalow was beautiful - it had a king-sized bed with a sunken living room. We ordered room service every morning and ate on the porch - very nice. The property is very large but they have trams driving around all day to transport you around the property. The lobby of the resort is also very pretty. The employees were all very nice - they mostly all spoke English - my wife happens to be Dominican so we felt very comfortable at the resort. We bought souvenirs at a small shopping area on the beach just to the left of the resort about 1 mile up from the hotel. Most of the guests that we met were Russian, French, Italian, Argentinian and Canadian. I would rank Bavaro Beach among the best beaches in the Caribbean. I've traveled quite a bit and I highly recommend this resort.

<Content>Excellent hotel despite the food My husband, son and I stayed at the new Reserve section of the Paradisus Punta Cana over the new year's holiday. Overall, the experience was excellent. We stayed in a junior luxury suite. The rooms were well-appointed and clean. There was an enormous jacuzzi tub, a massage shower, a bedroom, living room, kitchenette, and balcony. The room overlooked the Reserve's private pool which was surrounded by plenty of private bed/huts and lounge chairs. The Reserve also has two private restaurants - Gabi, for breakfast, lunch and dinner (buffet) and Vento, fine-dining. We spent most of our time at the Reserve section of the beach - very clean sand, plenty of lounges, plenty of shade, etc. The staff is extremely kind, especially to children, although the lack of english is a barrier to getting things done. We did feel that the front desk staff needed to have at least one FLUENT speaker of english to provide orientation and solve little problems. (This is not just for us Americans, the hotel had a large number of native French and Russian guests as well. ) Drinks were plentiful and of good quality; food was easy to come by, but, as noted by many others in all reviews of all-inclusives, is the food is just not that good and we did get sick either from food or water. Overall, the beach and the service made up for the food, but I do wish it had been better.

<Content>over rated If want to sit on the beach and relax and don't care too much about anything else than this place is for you. Check in is a disaster be prepared for a long time at the front desk as the staff constantly stop what they are doing to answer the phones. Our room wasn't ready when we checked in and we couldn't get into it until after dinner and we still didn't have sheets on the bed and were asked to leave again so the housekeeper can finish the room. The restaurants are fair the chineese was good, the seafood was fair, italian was good this is the only restaurant open daily for lunch and dinner other than the buffet. The buffet is a typical buffet, but not all the food is labeled. There isn't a mexican restaurant on the property when we asked where it was the guest services informed us that one of the restaurants turns into a Mexican restaurant on Monday nights, but on Monday it was no where to be found and no staff knew where it was either. The rooms smell moldy, and we did have some mold in the corners of the bathroom. The pool is nice but the all inclusive package allows you to just use one pool,you can't use everything on the property. The spa is nice I would recommend a massage on the beach $75.00 (U.s) for 1 hour. The eco walk park they advertise is closed. The casino they're supposed to have n the property is also closed. The fruit basket and champagne they offer honeymooners wasn't ever sent to our room. Which if you're not comfortable with an open bathroom this isn't the place for you.There aren't any doors in the bathroom only shutter-saloon door style pieces of wood hanging in front of the toilet. So privacy is very limited. Make sure you bring tons of extra sunscreen as it's $26.00 for a small bottle in the gift shop and bring bug spray as there are a lot of mosquitos.. The pool is nice a long with the pool bar, but here's where you'll find the majority of the little kids. You could walk to everything on the property but there is a tram that will pick you up and bring you around also. The activities are hard to find and figure out where they are happening and when. There is also supposed to be a fun pub/karaoke bar on the property but after a while we gave up looking for it.???? The beach is beautiful and well cleaned, the lounge chairs on the beach are comfortable but they do fill up fast so get there early. and he security on the beach does a great job on keeping away vendors and time share people. We weren't bothered by anyone once. There is a desk in the main lobby for any questions or concerns or help around the hotel but there are only two people working it so be prepared to sit for awhile as there is usually a line up.

<Content>beautiful people we went here for our honeymoon and had a fantastic time. The people working there were unbelievable. Very kind, polite and helpful. I have been many places in mexico and this doesn't even compare. I recommend this place fully. I am so glad I picked this resort for my honeymoon.

<Content>It麓s a good place to go if you wanna take rest. A place to rest, not a place to party or meet people. The place is awesome.

<Content>Paradisus is only a word.. I needed almost a month to write about the holiday my wife and I had on December, trying to find the proper words..When we arrived we were stored in a sort of cellar that they call room with a king size bed with only a night table, on the right, while on the left it was closed to the wall, a bathroom without windows, and a strange smell of somethig ancient all over the room..the day after we asked for a change..we saw even the royal service rooms..the same of the other ones with a little Jacuzzi..no way..we decided not to waste our money..we tried the restaurants..should I talk about them? Chinese: all plates with the same flavor; Japanese: the caribbean chef had no idea what is a real japanese cuisine; French: c'mon this was acceptable; Brasilian: food taken from the freezer directly to the microwave oven; Marino: maybe the best; Italian: not tried..we eat italian cuisine every day; Mexican: open only one day a week, impossible to eat there, too much people; the buffet in one week had every day at lunch the same plates..but the beach was so lovely and the sun and the wind make you forget almost evertthing, at least during the day, and the pool too..the staff was so kind and not too oppressive with the people not interested in doing activities..so..if you are searching only relax and drinks for free and you don't mind about food and luxury you can go there..but they have to work hard to reach the five star they have on the travelling catalogues.

<Content>Paradisus Punta Cana Went here with two girlfriends to have a week of sun, relaxation and no work or other distractions. That is exactly what we got.We were nervous about the check-in process as we had read several reviews saying it was difficult, but experienced none of this. We checked in without any problems and were even greated with Pina Coladas. Once at our room, the porter called room service for us to order us a bottle of champagne to start the week off right.Our trip consisted of lots of naps, reading and lounging by either the pool or the beach. The staff was all very friendly, and most spoke pretty good English. The pool was spectacular, and there were always plenty of chairs available, either out in the sun or under one of the many huts. The beach was also beautiful, and on our daily walks on the beach, we found that our area and chairs, huts, etc. were far superior to those around us, in both directions. The grounds were extremely well maintained. The rooms left a little bit to be desired, but we really weren't there to hang out in our rooms. They were clean and did the job.We ate at a different restaurant every night and found the French and the Chinese to be the best. Breakfast always offered a wide variety of options (and delicious coffee!), but lunch was tough for those of us who were picky eaters. Good thing we were there for the nightlife, as there wasn't much to do. We visited the casino a few times (which was pretty small, but did the job) and had a couple drinks at the bar by the beach, but there really weren't many options.On the recommendation of another guest, we did the (included) horseback riding on the beach. It was AMAZING. You take a bus about 20 minutes and are then lead down a road on your horse to a spectular beach for a ride of about 30 minutes. The guides will even take your camera and take pictures of you and your guests on your horses. It was so beautiful and such a fun experience. Not bad for the $5-10 tips we gave them.All in all, we found that Paradisus lived up to its name. It was true Paradise.

<Content>Beware of Thieves! We spent 10 days at the resort around Thanksgiving week. This was our 2nd trip to the Dominican Republic. Everything was wonderful until right before we were to leave for the airport on our last day. We specifically asked where we could have the best security for our luggage that included a laptop computer before boarding the van for transportation to the airport. We were told the locked room off the lobby overseen by the bell captain of the resort would ensure the safety of our luggage while we waited for our transportation. As it turns out, there are no security cameras and they misled us into believing they would be responsible for the care of our luggage. When it was time to board the shuttle to head to the airport, we discovered our laptop computer missing from it's case which had been stored in their locked room. The hotel informed us they would not be responsible for the theft and could not reimburse us the value nor provide any form of compensation. The hotel manager became indignant with me when I asked to speak to someone higher up. It's my belief that the resort/company has insurance for loss/theft such as this, but chose not to accommodate in any way. The manager even suggested I may not have even brought a laptop with me! Sol Melia has over 300 hotels/resorts worldwide and I can't imagine there is nothing this company can do for the theft of my laptop while under their care, custody and control. We feel that the local employees need additional training to encourage tourists with valuables that the hotel is not responsible for loss or theft even if valuables are left in their direct care. Needless to say, we will not be returning. We hold Sol Melia resorts responsible and will never stay at any of their resorts because of the way we were treated when the theft occurred. Had the resort chosen to file a claim with their insurance carrier and reimbursed us for our loss , then they could've turned this unfortunate incident from a negative experience to a positive one and we could have shared a rave review with everyone.

<Content>We would return We stayed at the Paradisus between 12/15 and 12/21. My husband and I went with our 2 small children (3 and 11 months). We were looking for an easy, relaxing trip. Getting through the airport is easy (they charge everyone $10 for a tourist card). We pre-booked a ride to the hotel, but you could just as easily get a cab. We were one of the first guests at The Reserve section of the Hotel. It will be a fantastic section once it is complete, but while we were there a lot of work was being done and it wasn't fully functional. You have access to a pool, kids pool, kids club, restaurant and bar at the Reserve. A shuttle takes you to other restaurants and to the beaches. We spent more time at the main area and at the beach than at the Reserve b/c there were more people and less construction than at the Reserve. By the end of our stay, almost everything was open in preparations for the Christmas rush.Our room at the Reserve was a jr. suite and it was very nice - perfect for our family of 4.The people working at the hotel were amazing. My children were doted on and we were talked to and remembered everywhere we went. We had the family concierge package and enjoyed it greatly. We didn't use the kids club services because our kids were too little.We were asked to sit through the vacation club presentation and we declined. We were never asked about it again.The beach was great and as Family Concierge guests, we were in the Royal Service area. In general, the hotel was very quiet so there were plenty seats, beds, etc in all areas. The pool for RS was so inviting though it's for adults only so we didn't get a chance to use it.We did have some bugs in the room the first day or two but not after that. We even had to visit the medic towards the end of the trip for our 11 month old. The medic spoke english very well (my spanish isn't good enough to talk about medical conditions) and I thought we were taken care of very well.We wanted a place to just relax and be pampered a bit and overall we enjoyed our vacation and the Pardisus.

<Author>GoldenTanGirl
<Content>Good and Bad Just got back last night from 5 days at Paradisus Punta Cana. The resort grounds are a tropical paradise, the beach is one of the most beautiful in the world. I went horseback riding on the beach (included in all-inclusive rate) and had the best massage I've ever had at their spa. The food was good for an all-inclusive and the 24 hour room service was friendly and very quick.Sadly, the rooms are in desperate need of renovating. The pictures on the internet don't show the cracks in the doors and paint, the chips in the furniture and the small square cushions they try to pass off as pillows. The worst is the lack of privacy in the bathroom. The toilet is in a room that only has western type swinging doors. If you are sharing a room with your spouse or a friend and you need privacy, the other person has to go out on the patio. It's ridiculous. And worst than that, my girlfirend and I think our beds had bedbugs. Each day as our trip progressed, we noticed tiny red bites on our legs. At first, we thought sand fleas, but we never noticed anything biting at the beach. After a few nights the bites were getting worse, mainly on our legs. When I got home I researched on the internet and I definitely think we were bitten by bed bugs. I am going to write the mangement and let them know. Beware!

<Content>Good Hotel but be alert I would like to write a glowing review for Paradisus Punta Cana, and for the vast majority of its assests you could. It is a beautiful property that is kept incredibly clean. We were drawn to this property after a vist to the Paradisus Costa Rica. Punta Cana Paradisus mirrors the Costa Rica location in many ways. These type of places are not going to win any culinary awards, but you will eat well. My wife and I thought the Japanese restaurant was the best. If you are golfing at this property the Cocolata course was a solid course. The transfer schedules are listed and leave punctually.Now remember you are in the tropics. Our room had small ants that you could do nothing about. There was power outs and one time lost water after a hard storm. You will have a good experience if you keep an open mind. Do be careful of your belongings anywhere on or off this resort. Be alert of your own safety on or off this resort.

<Content>Loved the People Beach Resort Paradisius Punta Cana We arrived and were taken to The Royal Service Building for private check- in, where they gave us snacks and Champagne. After a brief proceredure we were on our way to our very beautiful Garden View Room which included a Butler and all the amenities we expected.The restaurants were all fantastic only two required reservations The French鈥淓l Romatico鈥?and the Japanese which we never made reservations for (no time) We were a bit disappointed when we had diner at The French only because we expected a more formal atmosphere however the food was good. We never ate at the Japanese, but we did go in and look. It as well as the French requires long pants and a collared shirt, I was wearing shorts then so we asked if they had a Sushi Bar. They again reminded us that we needed reservations and proper dress. What was Amazing was that they offered to make us a Sushi carry out and we accepted, it was wonderful,As for the other restaurants our favorite was the Seafood Restaurant , during the afternoon it has the most wonderful lunch buffet everything Fresh including you pick fresh fish that they prepare as you wish. They also have the biggest cheese burgers and hot dogs I have seen in a long time. At night they had a Full service menu which has all seafood selections. The next very good restaurant was the Chinese where we had a lobster dish that was out of this world. We went to the seafood and Chinese twice each.The breakfast Buffet is one of the best we ever had everything is fresh and there is a plentiful supply of fresh island fruit everyday. The pools are incredibly clean and appealing as well as the activities the staff provides including plenty of music and dance pool side.The beach is the most wonderful aspect of the entire vacation it is what one imagines, the color the scenic view in each direction and most important the cleanliness We have stayed in other resorts but this one was definitely the best. The people there go out of there way to make sure you are having the greatest time ever and they do it right. We recommend that you brush up on your Spanish or if you like pay my way I speak the lingo and I would love to go as your personal interpreter Lol My wife and I were there In November and we plan to go back ASAP! OHLA !

<Content>A Bit Overated At first glance, Paradisus is a wonderland; you are greeted at a beautiful lobby and surrounded by well manicured grounds and a wonderful beach. The problems with this hotel lie beneath its surface. The staff were terribly inefficient; it took an hour for us to check in, despite the fact that there was only on couple in front of us and there were a few staff personnel standing behind the counter doing nothing. While the bartenders at the resort were friendly, the rest of the staff were not, which in my mind is a very big flaw for an organization that is catering to travelers. The all inclusive feature of this hotel is great if your primary motive for travel is to drink a lot of alcohol. But if you are expecting gourmet meals, or even good quality food, you are likely to be disappointed. The food here is of the quality you might find at chain restaurants ubiquitous throughout the US; nothing exciting or inspiring, just a way to get some calories.

<Content>Can't understand how anyone could complain My husband and I had the best vacation EVER!!!! This resort is absolutely wonderful!! The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The food was excellent. If there was something that we wanted, but didn't see on the menu, all we had to do was ask and it was made especially for us. The beach is great!! The pool bar was the most fun!! The bartenders there were the best. The horseback riding on the beach was another highlight of our trip. The nightly entertainment was fun, also.As I said, I can't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy themselves at this resort unless they are just unhappy people in general. It's very relaxing, beautiful to look at, and very accommodating. The only things that I feel everyone should be aware of, is that it really helps if you speak some spanish, and bring mosquito repellent with you. Hope you have a great vacation like we did!!!!!

<Content>Lovely resort, would stay there again! I went to a destination wedding here. Lovely resort. Beautiful grounds. Our room was a suite with a step down to the living room area. A number of restaurants, all decent food. Room service was good too. We did have to wait to check in, but were given arm bands so we could get cocktails. Nice pool, nice swim-up bar. Level grounds so easy for getting around, or may take the little shuttle.

<Content>excellent resort-wonderful people We had a great vacation! The staff couldn't have been nicer. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. We've been to so many island resorts these last few years and this was a huge surprise. We've never stayed at a resort where the staff is so pleasant, friendly and accomodating.We'd recommend the Paradisus in Punta Cana to anyone looking for a great place to stay. p.s. we've also stayed at the Paradisus in Cancun and while it was nice-the staff here made all the difference.

<Content>Opinions of a young couple... My boyfriend and I just got back from the Paradisus Punta Cana. Overall our experience was average. I'll mention what I liked first...THE BEACH is picture perfect..gorgeous gorgeous and the set up that the hotel has is nice...they have these really nice beach chairs and gorgeous large huts for the shade..one of the best beach set ups on the strip. We didn't pay for the Royal Service and to be honest it didn't look as if it was worth the extra $$, all they got was beach beds and small pool. The pool was a lot of fun...it's a pretty big pool and it's not too deep just perfect. The rooms, I found, to be very nice and spacious. We had a nice lounge area and a balcony which I wouldn't recommend anyone to step out if they do not have 'Off', the mosquito's will do a number on you!The grounds were very nicely kept, the landscaping is just breathtaking. Very nature friendly.What I disliked...The Food, I didn't like the selection of their theme restaurants. It seems like they need to redo their menus. I was looking for typical Dominican food and they tend to americanize their menus which upset me. We ended up sticking with the buffet restaurants where they had a better selection of different foods.Another thing that bothered me is that in order to get to the reception/lobby, you have to take these mini carts to get there because the grounds were so big. I hated having to wait for these carts that usually pass about every 10 minutes.We attempted to walk outside of the grounds to the plaza where they sell souvenirs...we ended up making a U-Turn after the first three stores...there was wayyyyyyyy too much hasseling and fussing and whistling and yelling just so that you go visit their store.Altogether, I wouldn't recommend this for couples looking for 'action'. The nightlife is a little lame. But if you're looking to do absolutely nothing and just lounge then this might definitely work for you.

<Content>tropical paradise Beautiful grounds, a tropical paradise! Beach was great. Ten restaurants at this resort; all that we ate dinner in were very good.Service was excellent. Employees were very friendly and accomodating. No one had their hands out for a tip at any time. The rooms, however, were quite dated and needed many upgrades. I did find a huge cricket/roach type insect in the bathroom that freaked me out. The Casino was disappointing. Very, very small and did not open until 8 p.m. Not a lot to do in the Dominican Republic unless you're a sun-worshiper!!

<Content>Great if you want to just relax This is my first review as I feel the need to give back to the community. I have traveled to a great many places. The place is nice, clean, and the staff is friendly. (especially if you tip a little bit) The food is generally good. Some people prefer one restaurant over another but it really all depends on the luck of the draw and there is always enough good food at the buffet or grill. The layout of the restaurants is confusing and they rotate where they are and only certain ones are open on certain nights but all in all pretty good. The beach is great and very relaxing! As far as activies or traveling outside of the hotel, this is an area that needs much improvement. Lots of hassel to enjoy shopping because (like it is in most of Mexico) they pounce on you. For the price, this is extremely hard to beat and well worth it. There are nicer places in the caribbean, but far more expensive.

<Content>Been There Done That I decided to try out the Dominian Republic for once and it was alright. I don't think I would return however. This property was nicer than most of the places in Punta Cana, but it remains average. It was an okay vacation, but there was nothing that would inspire me to return to this country.

<Content>Beautiful grounds-relaxing environment We (myself, Husband, and son (5)) went to Paradisus Punta Cana for 4 nights. I would recommend the hotel to others. We also encountered many of the complaints that are noted in many of the trip advisor reviews. However, we also noted that our check-in was breeze and our room was ready before 2 pm. No bug problems on ground level room in building 22. Just spotty service in many other respects.I had tried to contact the hotel via email prior to arrival, but they never responded. I'd say for families looking to save a couple of $$. Don't opt for the family concierge. It think that it was about $100USD more a night (maybe more), but not worth it unless you have no desire to even make reservations for yourself-and we didn't get in one night somewhere so it would have been better if I'd just done it myself earlier.....

<Content>Great beach and pool but wouldn't go back I stayed at the Paradisus from October 20-24th, and did experience some of the other problems listed by other reviewers. We were supposed to have a king sized bed, but had two doubles and it took me an hour to change rooms. Only the rooms are air conditioned so be prepared to sweat while in the lobby or eating your meals. Coordinating a round of golf is an obstacle and it does cost $35 per person to play so it's not completely all inclusive. The food is not terrible, but it isn't great either. (While there is a huge variety, some of it tasted stale and old). I've certainly had better at other all inclusives. Also, not all of the restaurants are open every night and some have private parties so we had to wait for a table almost every night. We also had small ants in our bathroom.That being said, the beach and pool are great---the grounds are immaculate. The shows at night are entertaining and there are a lot of activities to do during the day both at the hotel and offsite. The people are nice and friendly but service can be slow. Knowing some Spanish would be very helpful as not everyone speaks English.

<Content>Great! Maybe...Again The Paradisus Punta Cana resort was beautiful. Me and my wife stayed at the resort from October 14-20, 2007 for our honeymoon. The sites and service was great. The all-inclusive package is the way to go. All food, drinks, room service, nightly shows, and much more was included. The only problems we had was that our room was wrong when we arrived. We asked for one king bed and recieved two full beds. We just pushed them together instead of changing rooms and repacking everything. Also our room had a terrible ant problem. Each day there were ants in the bathroom and if we left room service left overs out, the next morning there would be lots of ants. Other than the ants, everything else went great. Very friendly people and even though the language barrier was a little difficult, the workers knew enough english for us to recieve what we needed or wanted. The only thing that may hold me back from going again is the language barrier. Beautiful and extravegant place!

<Content>Loved it! Visited Paradisus Punta Cana 9/29-10/6. Had a fabulous time in spite of some pretty scary reviews!. The resort is beautiful. The grounds are gorgeous. However, the room is a little dated but clean. Had no problems with ants. We stayed in bungelow #3 near the beach and the restaurants. I was a little disappointed that alll of the restaurants were not open every night. Food was good but I did NOT enjoy the Japanese restaurant. Seems like we should have gotten even more of a discount for the slowest time of the year. There were not alot of people there at this time of year. I didn't mind at all... made me feel that the resort was mine. The light crowd also made it possible for us to meet some really wonderful people. Nothing bad about this resort at all. I really enjoyed myself. Yes the room was dated and a little musty but nothing that a good candle can't cure. Besides We were only in our room to sleep... one night we slept on the beach (bring bug spray/wipes). The beach has the softnest sand in the world.

<Content>Didn't live up to expectations My husband and I went there for 5 nights for a part of our honeymoon. I must say, my initial reaction was complete disappointment. We arrived at the hotel at 4pm, to find that our room was not ready. We asked if there were any available upgrades and the person at the desk was very quick to say NO. We said that we were willing to pay any difference. He told us the hotel was full and to check back tomorrow. We were then escorted by our guide to the bar to get a drink where he proceeded to give us vague information and material about the property. He then pushed us to go have a late lunch at the only open restaurant in order to kill time before our room was ready. We went and ate then headed back to the lobby to get our bags and hopefully check into our room. We ended up getting to our room at 6pm and our keys didn't work. We had to sit outside in the extreme heat waiting for somebody to come let us into our room. 15 minutes later we were into our room but couldn't leave because our keys didn't work. The maintained man advised us that somebody would be up shortly to drop off working keys. The room was ok. It would have been much better if it didn't smell like must and have a moldy ceiling. There also wasn't any water pressure. After I placed a complaint call down to the desk that evening we were upgraded/moved to another room the next day. The room was mold free, closer to the beach, and had water pressure. Much better. The dining arrangements were the most difficult thing to figure out. It turns out that our 鈥済uide鈥?didn鈥檛 provide us with any of the dining information, so it took us about two days to figure out. There are around eight restaurants. Only two-three of them are open each night. There is a desk in the lobby area of the dining building that lists the open restaurants every morning. At that point you can make a reservation (there are only two that take reservations) or just figure out where you plan on eating that night. Be prepared for local cuisine in the buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They don鈥檛 label a lot of things, so it鈥檚 a guessing game. The food wasn鈥檛 necessarily bad, it was just different. The different cuisines they offered at the restaurant were pretty good. Not five star food, but not terrible. There really wasn鈥檛 any nightlife to be found. There was a show in the lobby at 10:15pm every night in which a small gathering of people could be found. The bar would stay open for about an hour after that, and that was pretty much it. The drinks were pretty good. They don鈥檛 have every liquor that you could hope for, but enough to get by and stay happy. Swim up bar at pool was great and fun to hang out at. If you plan on having a drink during lunch, it may be better for you to grab one before going in since the drink service at the restaurants in very slow.The resort itself was beautiful. There are little golf carts that are set up as a transportation system to take you around the resort. We found that everything, but the lobby, was close enough to walk to. It was a nice touch though. The beach was great. We never had a problem finding chairs under the huge palm umbrellas. They have double person, cushioned chairs which are great to share. We were told that we went during their off season so they only had half buildings open and half the staff on call. Which is also why only two restaurants were open each night. They were doing a lot of upgrading and construction, so there was no theatre which is why all the shows were held in the lobby. Also be warned that there is no air conditioning anywhere. The hotel rooms and the two indoor restaurants are the only places you will find air conditioning. Everything else (lobby, restaurants, bars, etc.) are open aired. This is wonderful when it is pleasant out, but torture when you have to eat your dinner in stifling hot temperatures. All in all, we were not thrilled with our visit. We decided that the next all inclusive we go to will be someplace more tropical and at a bigger brand resort.

<Content>Punta Cana Heaven My husband and I traveled the 3rd week in August. I located the sister hotel/Palma Real on the internet and after many phone calls to the reservations for both hotels..... Punta Cana was our destination. From the first phone call until checking out the hospitality was outstanding. I read the reviews very frequently and I think that many of the people must have been staying at another hotel! Here we go: Flight on American..arrive at the airport which is lovely... my husband's dive bag along w/many other passengers bags didn't make the trip... the baggage claim did the best they could and assured us that the bag will be on the next flight. the taxi ride was not too grueling.... $30 dollars and a tip. We arrive to the lobby and what a beautiful sight. We chose the Royal Service package so we were shuttled to the private check -in . A sign outside of the door welcoming the two of us. Nice way to start 7 long days. We then were driven in the tram to our room. We chose the beachfront romance suite. Second floor of bldg#20. The room looked just like the pictures on the website. The beach is breathtaking.... the only view I wanted to see! The RS lounge serves breakfast and lunch along w/hot and cold snacks in the evening.The concierge, Miguelina , was like a member of our family. If she hadn't heard from my husband on a daily basis, she was on the phone checking to see if all was good. She made dinner reservations for us without hesitation and was also a great help translating to room service. The majority of the staff speaks some english and if they don't someone is located to assist you. the RS beach is lovely and we sat one day. Our beach was right next to the dive shop and just as beautiful. Less crowded and right out the front door. The staff at the watersports and dive center are a bunch of the funniest people. while observing for 7 days, this resort is very safety conscious. All employees and guests wear life jackets for all water activities.During a rescue of an overturned sailboat the staff member ran down the beach,grabbed his life jacket and off he went. Very impressive. Not like that at the other hotels. We went deep sea fishing and caught nothing. The boat trolled in the ocean for 4 hours.... saw dolphins and little bird fish . The captain Miguel and his mate Leo were great!Scuba diving is nothing to write home about,,, very little life to be seen. Our stay was unforgettable and the service top notch! Oh, we took a few hundred dollars in 1's and 5's for tipping. Remember, just because traveling all-inclusive  shouldn't stop from tipping for great service. Enjoy!

<Content>Plan to return We were somewhat frantic to plan a last minute trip before our 10 and 12 year old children were going to return to school. We investigated trips to Europe and various locations in the Caribbean. I literally spent days searching the web and reading numerous reviews. We initially planned to spend 4 days in London and 4 in France, what a pleasant switch. The European trip would mean planning meals, tours, entertainment and travel from London to Paris. After booking the trip to the Paradisus, the rest of the trip was pretty effortless. Upon arrival, take the time to speak with your assigned concierge. He can provide you with invaluable information and make reservations at the Japanese or French restaurant. He can also provide you with information about excursions, etc. I read a substantial no. of the reviews before selecting the Paradisus. Having traveled rather extensively with our children, we are very conscious of the fact that if you are not careful you could end up with severe GI problems. Needlesstosay, the rooms are fully stocked with bottled water, soft drinks and beer. We used the bottled water to brush our teeth. My mother, age 78, who has a relatively delicate stomach experienced some minor problems, BUT it was related to overeating!!. Within a day and some moderation in her eating, she was back to 100%.I read the review of the couple that claimed the food was terrible but chose only to eat at the buffet. The resort has 10 restaurants. Due to the low occupancy, all of them were not open on the same night but they rotated and we had an opportunity to experience most of them. We found the food to be very good. The variety was excellent. The beef was very tender and tasty at the steakhouse. The seafood restaurant offered lobster, fresh red snapper and sea bass. The Brazilian restaurant served over 10 different types of meat and you were given a sample of each. The teppenyaki at the Japanese restaurant was as good as we could get in the U.S. The sushi was not very good but we are very finicky about our sushi and the majority of restaurants in the U. S. can't make good sushi. The Italian restaurant makes a great cheese pizza. I tried the carbonara pasta which I thought was very good. The salmon sauce was not as good. The tiramisu was very good. We did not eat at the Chinese or Mexican restaurant. As for the buffet, since I do not know what the couple ate who declared that they would not return, so I can't comment directly on their choices. I have no doubt, however that the chief or staff would have prepared something especially for them, if they asked. In addition to the buffet, there was also a grill where you can order a hot dog, polish, hamburger, brat and fries. Everything can be to go. I don't know how someone could write a review when he failed to experience more than one of the restaurants. They should stay at home and eat their cottage cheese and dry crackers.I do not drink but my husband enjoys a cold beer, good wine or a mixed cocktail. The premium selection meet his expectations.  As for the room, it is good size but the resort is beginning to show its age. The staff keeps the rooms clean and neat. Activities-my husband and I are certified divers, so we enjoyed the dive excursions, esp the fact that the cost was included and the convenience of having the facility on site. The resort also offered a free intro to diving so my children participated and we went on a 20-25' family dive that afternoon. My daughter takes horse back riding lessons so w also took advantage of riding on the beach. My husband came along but he has only ridden a few times. The front guide, my daughter and I went running down the beach. It was fantastic! (I have to add, however, that I went back a few days later and I had a different guide. The ride was ok but I was hoping to repeat the first ride). The tram was great for my mother, but I preferred to walk as much as possible after eating soooo much. The beaches are warm, clean and there are great waves for boogie boards. They do not have life guards!! The beach chairs are comfortable and numerous. The staff was accommodating, although none of us are fluent in Spanish. I believe that if you are respectful, you will be treated the same in return. We even had to use the medical clinic for an ear infection. The doctor was pleasant and appeared to be knowledgeable. My husband is a physician. The cost was comparable to the U.S.If you need internet access, you have to go to the lobby-WEAR INSECT SPRAY. I received over 20 bites in a matter of minutes. My husband on the other had received none! I can't explain it.The biggest con of the resort were the ugly Americans, loud, obnoxious and demanding. for selfish reasons, I hope that everyone from the U.S. reads the review from the couple that hated the resort and it continues to have a huge European clientele. Overall, we had a great time. My children, who are the typical video, game boy type of kids were entertained for the whole week. We plan on returning in the future.

<Content>Perfect Honeymoon We were at the Paradisus Punta Cana for our Honeymoon in early August. Everything about the resort was perfect. Royal Service was very nice, if you get RS, be sure to eat your breakfasts at the Royal Service Lounge. They will make you anything upon request. Beach was beautiful and pool/pool bar was a great time. Take a walk North on the beach for 20-30 minutes to find a big section of shops on the beach. It has a lot of local artwork that you can get for very cheap. Well worth it. Had no problem with the food at all, it was excellent. French and Mexican were the best in my oppinion. Don't be worried of anyones posts regarding food, we found it to be above average.

<Content>loved the hotel The pool is fabulous, and very large. There are more than sufficient chaise lounges in the pool area and on the beach both in the shade and in the sun. Unlike other hotels we've been to, you don't need to get up early to get a comfortable place to stay by either the pool or the beach.There are many different restaurants (I think 8) but each one has a limited menu, so check the menu before you go in the restaurant. Some are better than others. We liked French, Mexican and Japanese, but the menu at others (Chinese, seafood) was too limited for us. For 1 week it was OK but if we stayed longer it would have been too repetitive.Breakfast was our favorite since the buffet is very extensive. Service was excellent. Gratuities are included in the all inclusive package but the waiters and waitresses in the restaurants were all excellent and didn't expect tips. All in all an excellent place to stay.

<Content>I would return Food: Terrific selection at the buffet as well as the others. Entertainment: No exclusive location for night shows or entertainment, it is held in the lobby area (no AC) however the entertainment itself was good.Rooms: Spacious, well kept and cleanCustomer Service: EXCELLENT, employees are well coached on providing service. Language can be a barrier if non-spanish speaking however we got by.Family Entertainment: This could use some sprucing up. Overall our customer experience with both Melia Caribe and Paradisus were excellent and we highly recommend these locations for future vacationers.

<Content>Paradisus is Paradise Paradisus Punta Cana was one of the best resorts I have ever been to. Everything was excellent from the room to the service the food, the employees, the beach, the drinks, the pool...This hotel had it all! We would definitely go back. We celebrated our one year wedding anniversary and they made it very special by decorating our room ,making reservations at El Romantico (the French restaurant) and put flowers on the table and brought us champagne at no extra charge. The staff was very friendly and always smiled.

<Content>Fabulous all around resort I had a wedding ceremony there and there was approx. 20 of us that ranged from 2 years old to 60 years old. Not so good: I had someone in our party who is in a wheelchair. PLEASE NOTE: this resort is Wheelchair Friendly, NOT accessible. Thank goodness my wheelchair parapeglic guest is fit (he is with Canada Olympic Team) because it is very difficult to get around. When he originally checked in the first nite, the front counter gave him a 2nd level room. Then they finally realize that can be a issue, they gave him the first level room, but there are steps as well. The washroom as tight and his wheelchair cannot fit through the doors. Food: Food was fantastic! The steakhouse was everyone's favorite. We are from Alberta and we are very picky with our beef. The seafood grill buffet was our favorite. Things to eat: Shrimp, Fish, Steak, Scampi (Chinese Restaurant), Salads from Italian and Brazilian, bacon wrapped turkey.  Booze: They even had imported alcohol like Corona's, Hennikens, port and 7 kinds of red and white wines from different countries. You would have to ask for the wine menu.Room: Spacious and clean, we stayed in the Royal Service. There will be occassionally bugs around. They will lurk around being so the resort is in midst of the ecological park. The Butler service even set up a bubble bath for you with flowers and candles...ahhhh..nice !Pool: Nice! it's even got music in the background with many shady beds/chairs etc.Spa: go for the massage! Little pricey, but worth it!Activities: Many were included. I personally did not do much, but my guest quite enjoyed it! I think we stayed in the best part of the beach for Boogie boarding.Wedding: Laikin was fabulous! This was the best part of my wedding experience (I had 3 parts: April: paper signing/May: Beach ceremony/June: Wedding Banquet). Everything was picture perfect! The resort was pretty and perfect for weddings. Laikin makes it easy..all you have to do is show up with your dress. If you wish to have specialize flowers, email your wedding co-ordinator a picture of your bouquet/boutinere. Hair: We brought a picture of what i wanted. We did our own make-up. The ladies do not really speak english, but they do try. Bring your pictures if you want something done specifically! We brought our own photographers and you can check out our photo's at :dqstudios.com/gallery/selena/ Remember to tip, that always help! We were there for 2 weeks and service was fabulous! I think word gets around and service was never a problem! You have to remember many workers at the resort work 3 months on and not see their family for months. I think many of them support their family on Tip money.

<Content>Gorgeous but not fantastic - gorgeous beaches  grounds - very humid! - a lot of spanish workers - not a lot of information given to you so you have to take it upon yourself  - food not very good (we went to the buffet for dinner quite a bit) - family memeber got sick so just be careful (but don't eat only salads because we were told that could have been it) - very good  thorough doctor - stay hydrated - use sunscreen! - stay on the beach, there is a breeze. pool is pretty but way too hot over there - kayaking in the ocean sounds fun but it really hurts your [lower] back so I wouldn't recommend it  - parasailing is very good. wish it could be longer, but very good. worth it, I would say. - if you want more privacy on the beach, I recommend going downs toward the north end of the beach (left if your looking at ocean); a lot more space even though it is a bit further from the bars (it was close to our room so it worked out great, plus you're right next to the water sports) - on your door, you can put on a card that says do not disturb (like in most hotels here) but we were not told we had to have it flipped over to where it said, 'please make up the room.' our room was still being cleaned every day but on the third night they didnt come at all and it was 10pm and our room was still not done all because of the sign which was never a problem before, so to be sure when you leave in the morning flip it over to that side - massages were pretty good (had better, had worse). they give you this little robe though so for men I recommend wearing the towel they give you around you first then the robe. - don't buy anything on the beach it's a rip off. the gift store in the lobby is your best bet. it is quite expensive, but surprisingly its a bit cheaper than in the airport.  - the tv in the room gets channel nbc 4! so it was nice to wake up to the 'today show' and one of the only english speaking ones. (it also gets cnn, a fuzzy fox news, and a few others) - someone had mentioned that a 5 star to them is like a 3 star to us...couldn't agree more. coming from jersey our expectations were a bit too high for this much slower paced and carefree society

<Content>Great Resort Me and my wife just got back from our honeymoon where we stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana from July 23 - 31. Overall it was a great trip, and the resort itself is spectacular. I had read reviews before I went and found a lot of things that weren't true, so I wanted to give someone a fresh take since we just got back yesterday.The best part of the resort is clearly the scenery. There are palm trees all over the place, and the beach is as gorgeous as any I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning and even better than any of the pictures portray. The pool was simply amazing, and the grounds of the resort are well manicured and maintained. It was definitely fun taking pictures all around.The food was above average. We tried every restaurant except the Brazilian. The Mexican and Japanese were our two favorites. Four of the restaurants required a dress code, but they are all air conditioned so that was fine. Two of the restaurants, the El Romantico (French) and Japanese required reservations. They were both worth it.The drinks were plentiful, and they certainly did not go cheap on the amount of liquor in them. Often times we were surprised at how strong the drinks were. They offered a wide variety of different liquors, and my only disappointment was the lack of beer types. Presidente is served all over the resort, and you can get a few different types of beer such as Corona or Tsingtao in the restaurants. Overall they had a ton of different drinks to fit many different people and you should be happy there.The people at the resort are extremely friendly. The Dominican people love to dance and sing and often do it while serving your food/drinks or just going about their day to day jobs. They were very pleasant to be around and loved to strike up a good conversation, as did many other people we met at the resort. One of the most glaring things we noticed is the small amount of Americans at the resort. I would guess only 20-30% with a LOT of Europeans. Speedos and all =). The biggest disappointments of the trips were as follows:1) We don't speak much spanish and that lead to a few awkward exchanges with workers that looked like a poorly played pictionary game. However, most of the waiters/bartenders spoke English well enough to not have a problem, but it does become annoying after a while.2) The trolly service. There seemed to be two main drop off / pick up places for the trolly at the main lobby and back by the beach next to the Hybiscus. Often times you'd wait 15 minutes for one of these trolly's in the 95掳F heat and it would become annoying. It's not too far to walk, but I didn't want to look like I had just gotten out of the shower by the time I got there.Other than that we had a great honeymoon, met great people, and had a blast. We got to drive into a few other resorts in the area on excursions, and they didn't seem to compare to the Paradisus. I would definitely recommend anyone to go.

<Content>Love the DR I am a little late writing this review as we stayed in April 2007. It was our Honeymoon. We had a wonderful time. I had seen this resort back in 2000 and always wanted to come back, although if I were to ever go back to the DR I would opt for the Iberostar instead. Royal Service- We were a little lazy on this trip. We had Royal Service and I was a little disappointed with it. Maybe I wasn't assertive enough, but don't feel like I should have to be. They told us to call RS if we want room service or ANYTHING. We did and it took them forever to bring us stuff. They didn't get my pillow right that I ordered from the pillow menu. It took them 3 hours to bring us 4 beers. We started ordering from Room Service and never waited more then 20 minutes for them. I almost feel as if they had too many Royal Service rooms and not enough Butlers. But the Royal service lounge was great and Miguela helped us with booking an excursion. She was great.I was also expecting flowers in the room with little towel animals as I have seen in other resorts and never got that. But glad to not have the bugs. We loved the beach bar and Francisco was fantastic, but the bar always closed too early. Also we were under the impression that the Royal Service bar and pool was adults only, which is why we booked RS. We didn't want the kids splashing around us on our honeymoon. Every day and night we were there both loctations were overrun by Teenagers. Which was very disappointing.Food- The food was OK. I had a better experience at the Iberostar with the food. We enjoyed the Seafood restaurant and the Steakhouse the most. I was disappointed in the buffet selections. But it was no big deal, we never went hungry. I love the fact there there is alot of European type foods, as I love getting away from American food on vacation. Restaurant service was always wonderful. Beach- The beach is fantastic! The whole reason why we selected this place. My husband in I spent everyday playing in the waves and body surfing. We even stayed in during the rain. Fantastic! The softest sand, I love it.I don't want to say this is a bad place cuz it is beautiful and we had a great time. The Royal Service was very nice to have, but please, be more assertive with them unlike me.

<Content>Great place to stay CHECK IN:Checking in seemed to be the only exception to an otherwise outstanding and memorable stay. It seems that there are set times to check in (posted via sign) as opposed to U.S. hotels where you can check in any time. We did have to wait for our room even though we checked in past the time for check in so the rooms should have been ready. No worries as we were on vacation :). We tried not to worry about waiting around and if TSA has not detained our luggage (we thought it was lost, sent to our room later) we wouldn't have cared. Onward...GROUNDS:Very well appointed, clean and neat. The property was well groomed. The main building (check in) is set appart from the bungalows and beach. So you can either walk or take the shuttle tram. Peds and trams/cars shared the same pathway. This was a little bit annoying. We never felt threatened or unsafe but it would have been nice to have our own sidewalk. We liked to walk to work off all that food and drink :) ROOMS:Nice clean rooms with lots of towels and two robes. If you don't feel comfortable drinking the water, request some additional bottled water from the chamber maids. Don't forget to tip these folks as they work very hard. We tipped 5 dollars a day and didn't have to worry about asking for additional water or beer :) They took care of us and hopefully the extra money helped them out.BEACH:One of the better beach front areas. The sand was powdery soft and didn't get hot in the afternoon sun. Lots of lounge chairs and umbrellas to cozy up to. Mind you, this was off season so this may vary depending on when you go.Beach was topless which was nice :)Beach vendors aren't allowed to come up to you to sell their wares. You'll need to hail them. Most were carrying boxes of different types of cigars. They sold them individually or by the box. If you smoke Cubans, check to see if they are real. (I would love someone to post and let me know if when purchasing a Cuban cigar, if it was real or fake.) They charge more for Cuban cigars.No beach (drink runners) service though. It would have been perfect if they had that. POOL:A pools a pool. They have a swim up bar. It closes at 6PM. Pretty lively before closing. :)BARS:Our package was all inclusive so getting a Presidente was not an issue. Mixed drinks were loaded with alcohol, NICE!Bars had very little wait times to get served and the Barkeeps were friendly speaking both English and Spanish. Spanish first then reverting to English if you didn't understand. MEALS:Breakfast - buffet style. Some food was obvious but some was not. There were few signs telling you what you were eating. Few things were Americanized (WONDERFUL) so, I think you are eating what the locals might be eating. Sampling of meats, cheeses, breads, potatos, pastries, fruits, jucies and other stuff.The coffee was very good. It was smooth and not bitter like the stuff in the US. We bought a package at the airport to drink on the weekends to remind us of the fun we had there. :) Cafe con leche porfavor...grasias Lunch - Buffet style. Great variety. You can actually select your own whole fresh fish for them to cook up for you. Pretty cool. Not many signs identifying the food but it all looked, smelled and tasted good. Tip the drink servers well on the first day and subsequent days) and they'll remember you. Your glasses will never go unfilled :). The servers work all day so you'll see most of the same servers at breakfast, lunch and dinner. NOTE:I don't want to give the impression that service stinks without tipping, that's just not the case. Service will be extra EXTRA nice :)Dinner - Al la carte. Most of the resturants were pretty good. The seafood place had very good lobster as did the Chinese place. Pretty much standard fare. Very good stuff.I don't get hung up on the whole gormet dining expereince. You're in a differnt land. Drink, enjoy your company and eat! After a couple of drinks in you, you'll think it was the best tasing thing anyway :)STAFF:Great people. Warm and firendly. They speak Spanish first then revert to English if you don't understand them. Make an effort to learn a little bit of Spanish before you go. Don't forget to tip these folks. It's all inclusive yes but I'm sure they don't get paid alot. A few bucks here and there will go far for them. Very sweet people.Please note that this is the Dominican Republic. They do not march to the beat of the U.S. drum. They may seem slow in response but that's their speed. Remember to relax, drink a cold one and enjoy. They are excellent and if you give them a little bit of time, everything will be fine. They don't have a motto there per se but I had one and it was I don't care! and I didn't even when our luggage was lost :) This place is beautiful.Have fun!

<Content>TRUE PARADISE Our one week stay here was absolutely fantastic. I was quite apprehensive after reading many reviews. The hotel was beautiful. The grounds were very well-kept. The beach was positively perfect. The pools were lovely. The food was better than I had anticipated. We chose the royal service and I myself found it to be well worth it. Not many differences but the ones we did have were well worth it to me. The seperate beach area had better lounge chairs and also had alot bali beds.The pool was smaller but had chaises built into the sides. We also had a seperate restaurant . The best part was that no one under 18 is permitted. I had read that it doesn't matter you are still able to use these facilities even w/o the royal service, but they do make sure that guests are where they should be but in a nice way. We never had to ask for anything the staff always anticipated what you wanted and had it for you before you could ask for it. A few tips that really made it even better were to take an insulated mug for beer/coffee. Take a dollar-store raft, everybody will be jealous. Take along a few inexpensive items to leave for the staff and they will go above and beyond to show thier appreciation.Last but not least take plenty of $1 bills to tip.

<Content>Great place for a honeymoon!! After reading other reviews on Tripadvisor.com, I was a little concerned about this hotel. We did experience a few of the problems others spoke about but overall it was great! We did have to change rooms because the a/c wasn't cooling enough. But the hotel did take care of our concerns right away. As others complained that the maids stole from them, we had no problems with that at all. The safe locks were issued at check-in and used a key that we kept with us. A few pointers: Call the hotel ahead of time and have them arrange airport transportation. When you call the hotel, if you don't speak Spanish, just ask for someone who speaks English and they will get someone in just a few minutes. It was $30 (cash only) for 2 people each way. It's about 30 minutes from the Punta Cana airport to the hotel. We used Lorenzo's Travel and they were on time. It was nice to get off the plane and have someone there with a sign with our names on it. If you try to cash travellers checks at the hotel, they charge you a percentage of the amount (get cash off a credit card instead, the banker said they don't charge for that) Take a big stack of $1 bills. You will need these to tip which will get you excellent service. We tipped $1.00 for a drink, $3.00 for breakfast and lunch then $5.00 for dinner. If you try to get $1 bills from the banker he will only give you a few at a time. I took $50 in ones and it wasn't enough. Watch the dealers in the casino, we had a few issues at the roullette table. You're better off going to the casino right outside the gate of Paradisus. The hotel will get you a cab for $6.00. Take a cab back though, if you take the casino shuttle, they will drop you off at the staff entrance. That's a little scary! No, you don't need to know Spanish. We only came across two employees (one a groundskeeper and the other a maid) that did not speak English. Everyone else knows a lot of English or enough. ROYAL SERVICE is a must!!! You will get to use the Royal Service dining room, pool, beach with drink service (Lizardo the waiter is really nice!) etc. It is well worth it. Dress casual and light clothes. Most of the restaurants are open air and it gets pretty warm in there. I took dressy clothes and shouldn't have. Most guys were wearing Dockers pants and a light shirt for dinner, ladies were wearing a summery skirt or capri pants. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking. I wore sandals everywhere, you don't need high heels!! The food was good overall. It was basic though. We compared it to cruiseship food. A few things were a little scary like the whole raw fish on the buffet. Let's just say I didn't try that! Buffet breakfast, buffet lunch and one of many restaurants for dinner. Make reservations for the ones that require it right away. Lots of activities but we chose to sit on the beach and relax. The massage on the beach was heaven, highly recommended. Not much shopping in the hotel. (I wouldn't leave the hotel to shop)There is a little shop in the lobby that sells batteries, souveniers etc.. Guys walk up and down the beach selling jewelry, shells, cigars etc. We bought shells but were afraid customs would take them but they were still in our bags when we got home. By the way, the beaches are topless. Very few actually went topless though. Beach was gorgeous! The waters were not rough for swimming while we were there. We enjoyed it. Entertainment at hotel was good. Shows in the lobby each night and some parties on the beach were nice. Overall, great place for a honeymoon.

<Content>Unbelievable experience!! My husband and I had been reading these reviews continually and were a little aprehensive with some of the negative aspects of this resort...... Boy were we worried for nothing . This is one of the most beautiful resorts I have ever seen and we have travelled all through out the Caribbean. My husband and I were looking for a resort that we could simply relax since the children were not accompanying us on this trip and Paradisus delivered. The grounds were a treasure in itself with continually manicured and maintained vegetation , swaying palm trees ( complete with coconuts ) and tropical plants and flowers. They even have a small animal sanctuary that you must visit, be sure to say Hola to Maria the parrotThe staff were increadibly friendly and eagar to meet our every need. We choose the Royal Service and it was worth the extra money . We were shuttled to our private check in where we were presented with flowers and champagne, not to mention the signs out front welcoming us personally . Our conciege then took us to our ocean front bungalow. The sight of the turquoise water took my breath away. The room was lovely , clean , air conditioned and bug free. This was a worry from the previous reviews that we read. After ordering from our pillow menu ( yes, I said Pillow Menu ) and making the arrangments for our nightly aromatheraphy in the room ( all included in the Royal Service ) we set off to explore.The grounds are vast , but the shuttle runs frequently and is a nice way to tour the grounds and meet people. The pool was not as large as I expected, but still plenty large to get lost in . The pool bar was the hot spot , bartenders were fantastic and yes, the drinks were strong, but your on vacation so who cares !!!!! There was nighly entertainment in the lobby bar, which was great. The casino leaves something to be desired. Small and 1/2 the slots were not working . Not too much pay out here There were lots of on ground activities to choose from, but not nearly as many as in other all inclusive resorts we have visited. Horseback riding , water aerobics and the normal water stuff were enough to keep you busyThe food was okay, nothing to brag about. We did eat at every restaurant and my recommendation would be the Brazillian. Be careful, not all the restaurants are open every night so check with your concierge each morning as to which ones are closed that evening. Only the Japanese and French required reservations. We never had to wait to be seated at any of the other restaurants. Overall, an incredible and extremely satisfying vacation. I strongly recommend this resort to anyone looking to find paradise !!!!

<Content>Tranquil, relaxing and gorgeous stayed at the paridusus 07/12-07/18. ROYAL SERVICE IS THE WAY TO GO!!As soon as we arrived I told the staff that we had RS. He made us wait while everyone else went through regular checkin.They was a sign welcoming us -our full names. A butler came to pick us up in a cart. picked up our bags. We proceeded to the RS lounge w/ a/c (which was great -its very hot) They greeted us with Champagne and wet towels immediately. We felt very welcomed.We then ate at the RS restuarant (shrimp and the rack of lamb were great.PROS Staff very friendly- at the R/S say hi to Jose del la cruz, Janderson, and Hansel. As well as Lazerdo the R/S BEACH WAITER.By the way make friends with Janderson he is also the MGR at the Romatico.Beach- green water! Gorgeous Entire resort was full of Palm trees and plants - GorgeousRoom -nice. But I wish it was located a little closer to the R/S area. Have your TRAVEL AGENT REQUEST CLOSEST ROOMS.R/S BEACH- Make sure your in the right area. There is a r/s beach with no waiter service and one with one. Look at the ropesWaiter also brings you pizza during lunch-taste great- Fruit aswellbeds on beach were great. Beach party saturday night was great.R/S POOL -great. used the hugh beds on top of pool. not many ppeople used this though. Quiet!restuarants.ItalianSteak French All preety good.ConsThe steak and Italian rest. are outdoor-its still very humid at night. Dont wear long pants. Only to FRENCH.Night life - dont even bother. Go to sleep early and hit the beach early.brush your teeth with bottled water.The maid brought in flowers everyday but they came with ants.Dont forget to tip- Not Many Americans there- it helps to know a little spanish.Overall. If your looking for a Tranquil, relaxing, peaceful vacation - this is it!!!!Dont bring kids I dont think they will have much fun. Again the grounds were simply breathtaking.We did not go on any excursions. Heard the safari was great.Would definetely go again.

<Author>LawDude
<Content>Better than Expected with a Toddler Too! Background about us: we are a traveling type of family from humid Houston, Texas and have been to numerous carribean resorts, this was our first time to the DR, Punta Cana. Please note that we are hardly picky and very easy to please and do not require much. We booked our trip through Carson Wagonlit Travel on Gessner/I-10, our agent was Bette P.--her service was excellent and I do highly recommend her ---we missed our flight to the resort and wanted to stay an extra day due to the foulup--she even spoke to us via her home/cell phone and also contacted Go Go Travel and the resort to ensure all would be acceptable, which it was----took a load off my shoulders.Me--(36 yrs old) traveled to the Paradisus Punta Cana, along with my wife (31), monster-in-law (55), and my two (2) year old son. We stated there from July 8th through July 16, 2007. We booked two rooms: Wife and I in Room 2011 which was an Oceanview Royal Service Jacuzzi Suite (OV) and the monster-in-law and my son were in Room 2198 which was a Family Concierge Suite (FCS--the FCS allows the adults to use the Royal Service facilities) . Although the rooms were no larger in size than the other rooms (from what I observed), we did have a great kingsize bed in the OV room and the balcony was a tad larger as it was an oceanview. Greatfully, as we had requested, their was a nice crib in the FCS awaiting my son.Even though the Royal Service pool and beach are to be exclusive to adults and those guest is the royal service rooms, no employee nor guest complained that our 2 yr old accompanied us to both. Thank god! I also noticed that the royal service beach and pool were, in fact, exclusive to royal service/FCS guests. We did not try to bring my son into the Royal Service lounge, except for our check-in, but did bring him to our room for a few nights.I cannot say enough about the royal service and the family concierge service---very speedy and extrememely pleasant and helpfull with room service, romantic bath setup, pillow menu (fun), and in the RS lounge there is great food, internet access and the Miami Herald for US news: ROYAL SERVICE AND OV SUITE:Offers private check-in which you will be brought to the Royal Service private lounge upon your request and arrival at the resort---family concierge room has check-in at the family concierge lounge/clubhouse. You may also all check in at the front lobby. Superb service and food for room service, which came in handy when we didnt want to dress up on the occassional humid night (we are from Houston Texas I even thought the steaks were pretty darn good. My son gobbled up the fries as if no different from McD's back home----and my gosd, one night we actually got a huge and delicious piece of chocolate cake that had cherry paste inbetween the layers---sinfully delectiable. The room was verty clean and roomservice did a nice job of daily cleaning---no complaints at all. We never saw a bug or any in either of our two rooms and the AC worked great--no oder in the room or even on the resort from bug spray or bug problems. My wife loved the jacuzzi--and the RS butler did a fine and timely accurat job in prepping the tub with flowers, bubbles, and candles so to have it ready upon our return from a one of the restaraunts before she went to bed. I usually then went to the casion (more on that later). STOCKED fridge---no alcohol other than a bottle of local rum but as for soft drinks, juice and water then you name it and they have it in there--room service restocked very well and beers/booze were inserted upon my request and done very timely (within the hour). Bed, sheets and comforter were very plush and nice. The room's furniture was very acceptable, not new but not worn either. The TV was guite large, and did have CNN and TBS. They also had hispanic children's cartoon programing which my son seem to intrigue him when we needed a 10-15 minute break from playing when in the room. The only thing I could even think of to complain about was the room towel situation---they only usually provide 2 smaller hand towels, but always brought 4 each day after our request on the 2nd day there-----so that was nice to see. There were always plenty of larger towels to bath/shower and plenty of towels to use as floor mats in the bathroom/sink areas. We had a safety box, make sure to not lose the key as they will charge ya $50 if you have to replace the lock---we did not lose our two locks or keys! One other small complaint was that I would have prefered a key instead of a door card, preferably a key attachd to a wristband---but that is personal choice. FAMILY CONCIERGE SUITERoom was similar to the RS OV suite, but had two queens and a crib at the foot of the bed nearest the wall---a perfect fit. The 2nd queen bed was used (at our request) as the storage area for my son's toys/beach toys/floaties.etc. Room service did a GREAT JOB cleaning this room everyday---especially with the mess the two of them made. Every night, without request, the concierge service made sure room service delivered a cold milk box and about 5 small butter cookies for the kid---a nice touch. FYI--the previous reviews were correct in that the milk there is ultrapasturized--a tad more thick, sugary and will have bubbles/foam when poured--my son LOVED it--whew! We ran out of diapers on day 6 of 8m, no problem--contacted the family concierge via the cell phone provided and she came and got a $20 note, sent a bellman to the stores off the resort and brought both the bought diapers, receipt and CORRECT change back to me at the pool-----huge tip provided to her and the bell boy, but worth it! The FCS had great AC and the fridge was always stocked and refilled on time-----i do not know if the FC did the bath thing for my monster-in-law, but she notice how well they cleaned the room and that she never had any towel issues. FCS also provided you with a HUGE list of fun itineraries for the family and/or the kids in your family----arts/crafts/horseback riding/dance lessons/massage lessons----we didnt do many but it was nice to have them if we had gotten bored---the dance class we did do and afterward everyone in the class was provided a free 10 minute message from on the spa workers.BEACH Due to the RS and FC status, not only did we have a quiet beach and a reserved pool area----we were also provided with a good working local cell phone which allowed us direct communication with the concierges at all times ---which worked very well for personally delivered lunches to the pool AND the beach. I recommend the pizzas, but minus the corn that appearanly comes with pizzas down there. My son loved the bananna milkshakes with chocolate syrup on the inside of the cups for a nice visual effect. FYI--on the menus the term salami means pepperoni down there --yummy!The beach there is great and the sand is some of the nicest my feet have felt---as you notice the other resorts when you stroll either end of the beach, you made the right choice in going to the Paradisus. Our resorts total beach was cleaned everymorning, before sunrise. You will also notice how much more packed and crammed the other resorts and their beaches are. NOT ONCE did we have a problem getting a great spot, 3-4 beach beds together with end-tables and all under a glorious tree umbrella. We say usually inbetween the RS beach and the RS pool and RS pool bar. RS beach and pool area often has a person comming and going taking drink and food orders if ya need it, we really didnt utilize that service but was nice when we did. Please remember to tip all people working there a few bucks, perhaps it makes them work harder for you the rest of your stay, they were all very professional and courteous to my family and I---in fact, I never heard a single complaint about the RS from anyone on the resort during our 8 day stay. The RS pool is much smaller than the resort's main pool but there were much fewer people using it so it was fine--it also had built in beds in the pool (both covered and non-covered). The swim-up bar was also good there too. CHILDRENS ACTIVITIESThe family concierge lounge is has AC and lots of games and books. There is also a big playground with plenty of slides and has sand. They also have a moonwalk type thing to bounce in but that was too hot this time of year. There is also a private baby pool but the main pool was very close and seemed to have more to offer in entertainment, perhaps it would be better for an infant. MAIN POOLAwesome pool, quite large--plenty of places to relax in the pool and it even had a few raised ledges and raised islands for playtime with toddlers/infants----my son loved laying and walking on the ledges and islands----sometimes he would ask to go deep and let me carry him to the deeper areas of the pool---maybe 5 feet deep. One to two areas of the pool have zero depth so you can let the toddlers sort of walk into the pool and play in the very shallow areas too. Plenty of covered chairs/cots---never saw a sad face or heard a complaint from anyone. swim up bar was good and the they did activities right by the swim up bar.RESTARAUNTSThe breakfast buffet was very good, omelettes made while you wait--very good food, really!. We went to the the french, chinese, japanese, steakhouse, and seafood restaraunts and thought all were very acceptable. GROUNDSThe grounds are georgeous---and very expansive. There is a tram that goes throughout the property taking guests from one area to another. Lots of ponds with fish and birds, surrounded by rock gardens which my son liked to pick up and throw in the ponds. There is a eco-walk and a small zoo that my son liked. There is also archery and rock-climbing and horseback riding.SPA---full service, about $80 for an hour massage---I didnt use the spa but my wife and monster-in-law liked their services.BARS-----there is a fun pub near the main bar and lobby which gets going around 11 PM but most people go see the shows in the main lobby or the hibiscus lounge (near the restaraunts). top shelf liquor and free cigarettes. Nice cigars available for $7 in the casino. Try the Paradisus or the Cascade drink. The beer they serve is a DR beer named El Presidente, it was very acceptable---did the job. CASINO----they have 3 card poker, carribean stud, two blackjack tables and a roulette table. Max bet on blackjack is $100 and you can double down for another $100. The minimum bet is $5-----but if you want to bet less, you can play in DR pesos. If you play with pesos, you can only cash out with pesos. FYI--the ATM machine there only spits out pesos but the casino will cash your AMEX travelor's checks with no fee unlike the bank near the lobby which hits you with a small charge of 5% . The only problem I had with the casino is that the dealers were not that friendly, they warmed up after you had sat at a table for a few nights. The other problem I had was that the dealers do not check to see if they have a blackjack after the deal, which means if you have 11 and want to double down, you want to think again if the dealer is showing an ace. Even if you hit a 21 on your double down, you lose both the bet and the double down bet because the dealer's blackjack beats your 3 cards. GUESTSI would say that fewer than 20% of the guest were Americans with most guest being from Europe, Carribean or South America. The guests we met were very pleasant and nice, we exchanged numerous emails and numbers ---hope to meet up with some of them again in my travels. I would say that is is a laid back resort, not the party animal sort of place but there is plenty of opportunities to drink and be merry at night.I usually played at the casino (which let me bring my IPOD) and the house would pick the music. After that I would make my way to the beach to sit and watch the stars or the waves. I was very surprised that I never saw anyone go ocean skinny-dipping late at night, I did a few times and it was great. Just enough light to see where you are going but not enough for people to see ya if you didnt want them too.Overall, I would give this resort a strong 4 stars---I leave the 5 star distinction for more upper-crust resorts which really do not cater to families with small children. I would definetly go back again if I ever go back to Punta Cana and really enjoyed my stay there!!

<Content>Fantastic Place July 8 - 14, 2007I have travelled to almost every Carabien island and been to many resorts, but this property was the MOST BEAUTIFUL I have ever seen.The service was EXCELLENT, the people were freindly and could not do enough to make your stay a sucess. The food was good to excellent, the entertainment was OK and the casino stunck; but these are SMALL negatives.I was concerned after reading some reviews on this board, but do not let these reviews scare you. This place is fabulous and I recomment it highly.

<Content>Paradisus is Paridise Per our friends suggestion, instead of the free vouchers for transportation to the hotel we opted for a private van. It was great not to stop at other hotels. We had the Royal Service and it was truly worth it. We immediately were wisked to the Royal Service check-in- FIrst we had a cool glass of champagne- and registered. Since the room wasn't ready- we had a delightful lunch at the Royal Service Restaurant. We then proceeded to our room which was just across from the Royal Service Pavillion. The room, while not brand new was very clean and comfortable- no bugs- but yes a little musty smelling due to the high humidity- The maid Wendy kept the room very clean- we did give her a couple of dollars daily and never had any problems lacking supplies. The Royal Service had a private beautiful beach section and beautiful private pool with a bar. The main lobby of the hotel had the best bar. The drinks were great and plentiful. Overall the food was okay- always found something satisfying to eat- perhaps not gourmet- but living in NY we have very high expectations. The beach is shared by many other hotels- so great to people watch- many topless bathers- We used our laptop in the Royal lounge and that was free. Many activities- but we preferred just relaxing. Never saw any of the shows- so cannot rate- Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anybody who is look for a great restful vacation and a reasonable cost.

<Content>Paradisus is Paradise (especially for honeymooners)!!! We visited the resort from 6.25-7.2 and absolutely loved the entire trip. We highly recommend the Royal Service upgrade for a private pool with swim up bar, private beach with beach runner service for drinks and food, AC room with breakfast, lunch and snacks, and all of the other small amenities i.e. pillow menus, scent selections, room service, etc...Service and Staff:Everyone made sure to take care of our needs and always replied Everything is possible (Todo es posible) after each request. We did bring some smaller bills to tip when we had extraordinary service and we think this ensured great service throughout the week (ie - getting into dinner without special reservations). Our favorite Royal Service staff members for the week were Janderson (always made us feel like royalty), Jose (who greeted us with songs and smiles every morning) and Lizardo (who took care of us on the beach with drinks and food without us asking).Food:First off- we are not too picky with our cuisines. On a scale from 1-10, overall we would rate food as a 7.5. The key to enjoying the food is being part of royal service so you dont always have to eat a buffet breakfast and lunch. Instead, enjoy huge spreads of food (eggs made to order, pastries, meats, cheeses, etc) and lamb and lobster for lunch. Our favorite restaurants were Mexican and Italian.Upgrades:We also upgraded to a honeymoon package which included a private dinner for two on the beach (gourmet), couples massage, jacuzzi with candles and flowers, a small gift, breakfast in bed with champagne! The cost of the upgrade was worth it!Beaches and Pools:The private pool was awesome and the swim up bar was ideal. The private beach area with bali beds and shade were ideal. We walked up and down the beach and other resorts just didnt compare. Included Excursions:We thoroughly enjoyed kayaing, snorkeling and horseback riding on the beach. Just make sure to schedule these events in advance because slots sometimes fill up quickly.Overall - we had an absolute blast, relaxed, drank, ate and just enjoyed the atmosphere. We would highly recommend the Royal Service and the Paradisus in general.

<Content>Great Vacation My husband and I along with another couple had a great time at the Paradisus Punta Cana from June 2nd to June 7th. I am certainly looking forward to returning for a longer stay.If you are looking for a truly relaxing vacation this is the place. The ambiance of the hotel is laid back and peaceful. The grounds are beautiful and nicely kept. The hotel is surrounded by mangroves so if you decide to walk from place to place you are on a constant nature walk. Staff was very friendly and helpful hour host Luis was very nice. We had a small suite with a balcony by the pool. The room was spacious, the furniture is beginning to show its age, but it is not in bad shape. We had dinner in the Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and French restaurants. They were all nice. We liked the Chinese place the best. We had reservations for the Japanese restaurant but I did not like the feel of it so we left. Breakfast was plentiful with a good combination of local food such as mangu (mashed plantains) and American fare.Lunch buffet was very nice with a good selection of varied food.Beach was good. More waves than I expected but still nice. Make sure you get to the beach early otherwise you miss out on the big beds under the huge umbrellas. My suggestion to the managers ( I hope they read these) is more beach umbrellas, the sun gets very hot in the afternoon and you need the protection. Night life is quiet, the hotel staff does nightly shows that are quite entertaining if somewhat cheesy ... but all in all again, you are there to have a good time not as a Broadway critic.So again, I am very much looking forward to another stay at this hotel. The area is full of beautiful looking places, but why mess with success ?The one negative in my opinion was the hotel's pitch to sell you a time share. It is hard to say no and I felt forced to listen to a sales presentation even though we had been very honest about the fact that we had absolutely no interest in their product. So make sure that you say NO from the get go when your host starts offering you gifts, etc. Unless you are interested in time sharing and many people are ... dont waste your time.

<Content>great hotel - loved the royal service amenities Just returned from a week long stay at Paradisus Punta Cana. Fabulous resort, one of the best beaches I've seen. People were great and royal service was well worth the money in my opinon. Previous reviewer summarized the resrot very well, so I will only add a few other things. The only other tips I would offer: 1) Airport transfers: Consider taking a taxi from the airport, instead of the transfer with Prieto tours. We booked through AA vacations.com and the transfers were included. When we arrived at the airport, I asked the Prieto tour desk if the bus went direct to our hotel or stopped at other resorts. He assured me it went direct to our hotel - well, maybe something got lost in translation - it took an hour and a half with about 7 stops at other hotels to get to Paradisus Punta Cana. We would have been happy to pay the $30 to take a taxi. Some of the other passengers were smart enough to grab a few cold beverages for the trip - we should have done that. We took a taxi back to the airport at the end of the trip and it took about 25 minutes. Also, think about getting to the airport about 2 and 1/2 hours early - this way you'll beat the crowds and will be able to find a seat. They do have food and a bar at the airport as well as some shopping. 2) Diving - we took all of our own diving gear except tanks and weights. Went on 3 one tank dives all about 40 feet. Diving was good - not to much to see - did one wreck and two reef dives. Water temp was great. When we go back, we'll use the free gear at the dive shop instead of bringing our own - the dive shop gear was in good shape and for only a few dives, it was not worth dragging our own gear. One dive a day is included with your stay - if you want to do more than one dive a day or go on the all day excursion, it will cost you $. The dive shop employees were great - stored our gear for us for the week. 3) Water - drink lots of water. don't forget this - a number of folks we met at the resort became dehydrated and had to get treatment at the clinic. Bottled water is free - everywhere at the resort - keep a bottle with you when you walk on the beach. 4) Room was fine - nothing special. Clean - we tipped the maid every day and never had an issue with cleanliness or towels. We did have some tiny ants in the bathroom on the last evening we were there - sprayed, wiped the counter and problem solved. I accidently left some jewlery out on the dresser when we went to the beach one day - I remembered as we were walking back from shopping and was a little concerned. It was still there when we got back - and the maid had cleaned the room. I do recommend you use your room safe and keep your key with you. 5) Solicitation for time shares - we simply said no and walked away. It was never an issue for us. We skipped the orientation they scheduled for us at 10:00 AM on the first morning we were there - I suspect that may be where they initially hit you up for the timeshare tour. We were not bothered at all. 6) Would have liked to stay an additional 2 days. With 2 travel days, we only got to enjoy the resort for 5 days. Overall great trip. Go and have fun - don't hesitate to ask if you need something. Feel free to email me if you have a specific question about our trip.

<Content>Watch the Time/share Sales Pitch!!!!! As everyone says, the hotel and grounds are beautiful. The vacation over all was a memorable one, but the food was just okay. Breakfast and lunch buffets were good, but the restaraunts weren't so good, they are hot, and they were very slow. The room service was even slower, and I couldn't get them to deliver a beer to the room thru service or the mini bar... which had only water, and couldn't get them to restock even the sodas.The included excursions were hard to do, everything had a waiting list. The batting cage/archery never opened on time, and remember to wear long pants and shoes for horseback riding or your not going (no one informed us when signing up)I also left some pictures behind that we had taken, and could not get a call back or e-mail response from any of my inquires. Poor customer service! Speaking of.....when we first arrived, they were up our butts with smiles and helping. They even hounded us until we listened to their buy a timeshare/membership routine the 2nd day we were there, after we declined, so did the service and smiles. It's almost like they see the braclet that you have to wear for the all-inclusive, so they slow food, drink down, so you won't get too much for your money. They even collected the bracelets you left....how cheap!!! I was really blown away by having to sit thru a sales pitch on my VACATION!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Did not know what to expect Ok, Here is my unbiased american view. We booked this through an online travel agency; Sunset Travel, who was cheaper than expedia. Actually excellent!!! As for the Paradisus Punta Cana:There were 2 families in our party with 3 kids 8,7,and 5. Hotel lobby is gorgeous. No wait at checkin whatsoever. Had my first all-inclusive cocktail. Beware... ask for name brand or you will get call. We were escorted to our room, which was suprisingly clean and large. We tipped everyone. 5 to the bellboy and room service as well as the maid, 5 at dinner, and 1 at the bar after ever other round. Because of this we were treated like kings. The bartenders would fill our drinks before they were empty, and serve us first. We did find a roach in the room, but I was given spray. We had more water given to us than needed as well. Again tips go a long way.AS for the beach...WOW. The sand was like flour, so fine and white. Wading in the beach in the morning was unbeleivable.Waters very warm. The vendors on the beach are psky at the waters edge, but not allowed to come up to you, and need to stay away from the resort. If you make no eye contact they leave you alone. Every morning the beach is raked as well. As for the pool, it was a bit too warm, but still really nice. Swim up bar is busy at times, but a nice feature. Now to the restauruants. I am a picky person. The breakfast buffet at the Hybiscus is ok at best. Many things I had no idea what they were and they did not tast good. This place caters to numerous nations. For lunch the buffet at sea side is great! Or you can have a decent burger and fries at the grill.For dinner we ate at the Mexican 5 out of 10 stars, Italian 7 out of 10, seafood, 8 out of 10, chinese, 5 out of 10, japanese, 8 out of 10, brazilian 8 out of 10. There is a dress code. Again if you keep in mind this is an all inclusive resort, and the food is probably from the best stock available, you will not be dissapointed. The service was impeccable, everywhere! The Dominican people I met were so nice and friendly. I was reminded of this when I got back to Ohare and met the everyday folks who are so important to themselves. We Scuba'd 5 times. The folks at scub caribbe are great too . The dive sites are a bit boring. The reef seeme to be dead or dying?? But still lots of fish.The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the Kid's club. We are very protective though. Their hours are 10-12 and 1-2. Not real condusive. We did use on site sitters who worked out great as well. Every Night we went to the shows, which were nice.I have read several reviews on this site before going. I was amazed at some of the negative ones. I did see people not tip, and maybe they got treated rudely?? I probably spent $200 on tips in a week. That included 15 each dive. I was treated like a King. Now if I had to pay for the food, I would have given it a more critical review. We loved this place so much we have told every one to try it. We will be going back as soon as we can!

<Content>Beware of Dolphins Beware of the Dolphin Island tour. Soncho the dolphin attacked me and bite me for no apparent reason. The staff poured alcohol on the bites and cuts and refused to let me out of the water until after the dolphins finished their routine. They did not want to confuse the dolphins. Sorry, I was the one attacked. It was my 25th anniversary and the dolphin spoiled the trip. I had to get shots when I returned from DR on Monday June 25th and I am still taking antibiotics. I loved everything about DR and Paridusis except the dolphins. I can't even get my money back. I am planning on posting the attack pictures and my bloody arm, chest and back so as to warn all parents not to allow their children to swim with Soncho the dolphin at Dolphin Island.

<Content>Beautiful Place My family just returned from Paradisus. First, I want to thank all the reviewers. Thanks to them, we were COMPLETELY prepared. I really knew what to expect, what to bring and what to do. The place is beautiful. Lush with vegetation and immaculately groomed. The pool is unbelievable. It winds and twists with several hidden corners. We were able to stay in the shade while the kids, ages 5 and 8, swam around. The bar scene was lively but completely-kid friendly. Bring goggles-the pool's well-chlorinated.The beach-again gorgeous. Clear greenish-blue water with enough surf to satisfy the sailors in my family. We did grab chairs under the protective cabana/trees after breakfast, but there were always some shaded seats available. The help, great. Even when they didn't understand us they tried. One service attendent called the front desk and used them as a translator when he was having trouble with our Spanish (or lack there of.) Many spoke English.The food. We loved the breakfast buffet. It's sort of a Euro/Latino mix. A roomful of breads and rolls. A large choice of sweet rolls and bread as well. Inside an a/c room, sliced meats, cheeses, fruits, eggs cooked to order (tell Bernardo the omelette guy we say hi), hot cereal, potatoes, plantains, bacon and the like. My spoiled American children had trouble with the milk-it's all ultra-pausterized. Very safe to drink, but thicker and sweeter than our pasteurized milk. Luckily, with the help of some wonderful servers, they discovered the pleasures of cold limonada and hot chocolate. At lunch, we feasted on salads, roasted meats, pasta and fresh fish cooked to order. This is where my kids got their big meal at the cooked to order pasta station. Dinner was a bit of a let-down. None of it was great. The steakhouse was probably the best followed by the Mexican. Skip the Chinese, not my favorite. Except for grilled meat and the chicken strips at the steak place, there was little for the kids or anyone who prefers to eat simply. Fill up at lunch and take dinner in its stride.The room was nice, but we felt a little cramped. Next time I'd look into the brand-new 1 bedrooms opening this summer. Our room was a tight squeeze-especially for our clothes. Also the room, especially the bathroom, could use an update. We brought lysol and were glad to have it. Also, we had trouble getting really hot water during peak times.Bring plenty of sunscreen, we went through almost everything we brought. Bug spray-the bugs feasted on my son the first night until we realized we needed to proactively spray the kids. Have plenty of small bills to tip the zillions of people who help you. Make sure to return to the lobby to hang out in its beautiful public spaces and at its bar. Don't miss the Mediterranean-style beach bar. Visit the zoo and say Ola to the parrot. Skip the march down the beach to the flea market. It's a long walk and on Friday nights the best of the market sets up shop outside the restaurant area.And relax. For the money, this is a great find. I was horrified by the beach (and the crowd) in front of the Princess resort on our way to the flea market. I was so HAPPY to get back to Paradisus!

<Content>Can You Say Graet!!!!!!! First let me say some reviews I read had me questioning the property and others had me excited. I am so glad I went twith he excited ones. This place was GREAT, we have another couple we travel with each year and every one was sad to leave.I will address the areas of negative reviews and give ymy opinion:Staff 鈥?From the time we arrived until we left everyone was great. Yes not everyone spoke fluent English, however, with a little patience you get it worked out. We had a lot of fun with it. I have stayed at state side 5 star hotel and didn鈥檛 get the service we received. Rooms 鈥?Yes the furniture is a little used but in good shape. If you are going for the furniture then reconsider where you are going. Because of the musty smell and bugs reviews we both bug spray and candle which we didn鈥檛 need. The maid we had was more than glad to provide anything we requested and kept our frig stocked with beer and water. A little tip to start out made sure me beer supply never fell short. Food 鈥?We ate at every restaurant and found the food very good and the service great. We made reservations for all the ones that required them as soon as we checked in. The lunch spot was my treat of the day for the grilled fish. You made your choice of which fresh fish (whole) you want and then they grill it with, side of lime so good. We called one night around 2 am got a pizza, bottle of champagne, beers, sandwiches and party on. Each morning we palyed gold we had to leave at 7:30 am they had breakfast at our door at 6:30 am.Grounds  Beach 鈥?Can you say flower garden, with all the flowers and statues you felt you were at a botanical garden. The beach was clean and more than enough lounge chairs. An example of how this property separates itself from others they have crew on the beach before morning raking up sea weed. All the other property guests have to deal with sea weed. Activity 鈥?We played golf every other day and the course was great and in great shape. For $35 you couldn鈥檛 beat it for resort golf. Shows every night and must say not that bad.Bottom line I gave it 9 out of 10 just because 10鈥檚 are perfect. Don鈥檛 let the negative reviews scare you. We have travel the world and I would say this ws one of those trips that you will talk about for some time. P.S. If you want to have a hassle free airport transfer contact Dominican Airport Transfer [--] they charged $80 round trip for 4. On time with sign outside baggage claim, on time both ways, clean in new van with a/c and driver drove well.

<Content>Truely Paradise We booked 2 junior suites with jacuzzis. My husband, myself and my daughter in one room and her boyfriend in a room. The room was spacious and very clean with beautiful garden views. The grounds were spectacular and the service was wonderful. Everyone right down to the gardeners were extremely friendly and helpful in every way. Check in was a breeze and we were quickly taken to our rooms where the air had already been turned on and were extremly comfortable. They do try to get you to come to a time share promotion but when I said no, nothing else was said and they did not ask again.  We were in building 26 and were only 2 buildings away from the beach. We were a little distance from the pools and restaurants but not too far and walking the grounds was lovely. There was a little bus trolley that ran constantly *like every 5 minutes* so you did not have to walk if you did not want to. Overall it was a very good location. Food in the restaurants was very good and they even had sweet iced tea! Important point for southern girls and guys! The Steak House *Al Bufera* was very good as was the Seafood Restaurant. The Italian restaurant was good but not our favorite. We all enjoyed the buffet breakfast daily with lots of choices and many different items daily. The beach was beautiful and well kept with plenty of chairs and palapas for everyone. The pool was amazing and very clean. It closes at 6pm and I really wish we could have had some night swims but most of the pool staff works at night in a restaurant so they have to close I suppose. Because this resort has so much beach front it never seemed crowded but as I looked up and down the beach in front of other hotels it seemed very crowded in front of the other ones but not in front of Paradisus. There were so many things included that are not included in most AI's. Horseback riding, scuba, snorkeling excursions, Hobie cats, Name brand liquors and the list goes on. We literally spent not extra money except for the obligatory tourist t-shirt and tips. I did not notice many people tipping but I always do and these people make very small salaries and truely appreciate even the smalles tips. Service was so wonderful though that I can not say it improved service, I just felt good by tipping. I had read some negative reviews about the property so I was a little leary at first but I absolutely would stay here again and would probably book for longer next time. We only stayed 5 days this trip. If you have any hesitation about the DR or the Paradisus throw it out and go. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Absolutely paradise! We were married at the Paradisus and had a group of 30 friends and family with us. The resort is absolutely gorgeous! The grounds are amazing. The beach is the best that I have ever seen! We were a little worried about the food, but it was actually delicious. Our favorites were the steak restaurant and the chinese restaurant. The restaurants that require reservations were a little difficult to get into, so plan ahead. A few in our group had stomach issues, but nothing that kept them off the beach. I was impressed that all of their water is bottled (even the water they pour from pitchers into your glass). The employees were amazing and so friendly! We had the royal service package and this was the only are we experienced some difficulties. The location was excellent, however we didn't feel the extra services were worth the extra money we paid. They make is seem like you get the royal treatment, but we found nothing different from our friends that did not do royal service. If anything, when we did ask for something we were treated a bit rudely. We would absolutely visit again, but we would never do the royal service. Overall, this was the most beautiful resort we have ever visited and we would go back in a heartbeat. It really is paradise!

<Content>Wonderful Vacation -- WILL visit again My husband and three children (17,15 and 12), as well as another family (friends with the same aged children) stayed at this resort June 10th thru June 17th and had nothing but positive experiences. We arrived at the hotel shortly after 1 PM and were able to check right into our rooms. The food was very good, the service was wonderful, beautiful beaches, numerous activities to choose from, etc. We travel every year and try to visit different areas to experience the Country and appreciate the different cultures. We have found that your vacation will be what you make of the experience. These people cannot do enough to try to provide you with whatever it is you want. A language barrier -- somewhat. We have visited other places that absolutely could not understand -- but had a great time. Again --- it is what you make of it. Based on our experience with this resort and the Dominican in general, we ALL agreed that this will be a place for us to visit many times over!! RELAX, ENJOY, but most importantly........APPRECIATE!!

<Content>Didn't want to leave!! My husband and I stayed here from 6/9 - 6/16, and had a great time!! Overall, the resort is excellent. The grounds are beautiful, and the employees are friendly and very accomodating. We had a basic Junior Suite, which was more than adequate, however, the mattress made our backs hurt (minor complaint). The food was nothing to jump up and down about, but we very much enjoyed the French, steak, and Mexican restaurants. We did not enjoy the seafood restaurant, and Italian was okay. We did not drink the water, or brush our teeth with it, but both of us spent a day eating Immodium like it was candy, so I'm not sure what happened there. The bottled water they serve is from a local spring, so I don't know if it is completely safe either, so after my tummy trouble, I switched to Perrier, and things seemed to get better. The pool bar was a great hangout, and the drinks are strong!!! :) There is not much in the way of nightlife, but we weren't really looking for any, so it didn't bother us. The beach, as many others have posted, was indeed beautiful, and there are plenty of chairs and bali beds for all. There's no need to tip (we did anyway), as service is pretty prompt, and the entire staff are very willing to bring you what you need. Maid service could be better. We left a tip for our maid the first day, along with a note written in Spanish asking for beer in our fridge, but when we came back, the tip was gone, the room wasn't cleaned, and there was no beer in the room. She cleaned later, but never left any beer. I highly recommend learning some basic Spanish before you stay here, as most the staff speak little English (bartenders speak more English than maids, and waitresses). This is not a complaint - we actually felt badly for not being able to communicate in the native language. Overall, we had a great time, and we were sorry to leave.

<Content>Room thefts Vacationed at Paradisus Punta Cana 6/11-6/14/07.Hotel was very nice-beautiful grounds, friendly service, food average. Overall would have said it was a very nice vacation. Two major problems: 1. We arrived at 1pm, check in is not until 3pm. We did not get into our room until 4pm- we travelled during the off season-so the resort was not crowded, reception repeated told us our room was not cleaned yet and kept advising us 15 more minutes, a familar story that was also told to other guests that we spoke to duing our stay. 2. The day we checked out, we got to the airport when I realized I had left a bag which contained a battery charger to my digital camera in a draw in my room, as soon as I got home I phoned the resort and spoke to 2 people in lost and found who told me nothing was turned in. I then spoke with a manager and was told he spoke to housekeeping and was told nothing was found in the room. So obviously the bag was stolen and not reported to the lost and found-which is very dishearting because the bag was a cheap cavas bag w/ only a battery charger in it. I was also told by another guest who had left some costume jewerly out on her dresser, which was stolen as well and when she reported it stolen the manager told her to call the local police and was of no help. So be careful about what you leave out -use your safe and triple check your room before checking out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Author>Pool-Fun-In-The-Sun
<Content>fantastic First time in the Dominican. Stayed for 6 days in Royal Service the last week of April. Traveled with another couple. Airport was fine. You get off on the tarmac and have to pay $10 per person to enter the country. It is supposed to pay for the highway. The ride to resort was fine, about 25 min, and we had a mini bus with ACRooms were very clean and AC worked great. Maid service did a great job and left whatever we asked for. The main advantage of RS is that you are close to the beach and they have another option for breakfast , lunch and a happy hour in their lounge. There is also a smaller RS pool which is nice to go to because it is not as crowded or as noisy as the main pool. If you get RS, tell them immediatley upon arrival at the resort because you have to get a ride to the other side to check in, NOT at the main lobby. Don't waste your time standing in line as we did.We spent most of our time at the RS pool but the main pool seemed to be more fun at the pool bar. The drinks were plentyful and strong at both. The beach was the best part. It was very clean, white sand, blue water, and palm trees. There were plenty of chairs but you had to get up early to get a Bali Bed, which is a necessity. The sun is very hot and it is nice to lay under the grass huts in the shade. Try to get both if you can. Bring sun screen. You definatley need it and it is very expensive at the resort.There are 9 places to eat. We liked every one that we went to. There are alot of choices at the buffet. I was a little worried with some of the reviews on the food but we did not have a bad meal the entire time. The best place for lunch is the buffet at the beach restaurant. But if you want a quick burger or hot dog, go to the main pool bar. We thought all the dinners were good. Especially liked the Steak House and French. We had wine at every dinner and got great service. Make reservations the first day if you want to eat at the French or Japanese restaurants. The Japanese was good but it is like every other one around, and I would have rather tried the Brazilian or Mexican.Not much of a night life. They have a show starting at 10 PM every night in the main lobby area. They also have one bar there and they play latino music. We saw three shows and they were just OK. The magic show was the best. We enjoyed going to the beach bar at night and relaxing.Are main purpose of this vacation was relaxation and it was the perfect place for it. There was planty to do during the day if you want to, like horse back riding, snorkeling, excursions, water activities, but we really enjoyed lying at the beach or pool.You do not have to tip, but we did. I don't know if we got any better service but the staff really work hard. We gave a few bucks to the maid every day and tipped the waiter at dinner every night. We would defininatly go back to the Paradisus. We heard nighmares on the way back from other travelers that their hotels had bugs, leaky roofs, poor food. Just remember, a 5 star hotel in the DR is like a 3 star in the US.

<Content>Loved Everything About This Vacation Great Place...loved the staff and the rooms...all visitors were so friendly. The food was awesome and I am a very picky eater. The Itaian was great and we stayed away form the french as everyone said the portions were terrible! The japanese is the worst...DONT GO!! The water (ocean) is so calm and you feel like you are in a spa on the beach! The spa is beauitful and people once again so nice. Do a massage on the beach also. I want to go back with my teens next year. Dress is very casual. The casino is small but a fun place to meet people from the beach. The bar in the lobbby is the best and always rocking..the nightly shows are awesome!!! GO GO GO you will not regret this choice

<Content>Fabulous wedding  We just returned from our trip to the paradisus punta cana. We hosted our wedding there with 34 of our closest family and friends, ages ranging from 28 - 70 years of age. A fabulous time was had by all. I did not visit the resort before chosing this location for the wedding, over the last year I read ALL trip advisor reports. I tend to disagree with allot that was posted. Here are my thoughts on the hotel.Royal Service - we upgraded since it was our honeymoon as well. The lounge with breakfast, snacks and dinner was nice, although we very rarely used it. Private pool and beach area was cozy - great beds! Free internet in lounge, conceirgeassistance there was great for activities and restaurant reservations.Our Room - we had a ocean view royal service Jr. suite. Room was very clean, air conditioning work just fine. We did not see one bug in the room. Additional beverages we brought quickly when requsted. We received little gifts each night,Beach - Bavaro beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen, and I have traveled to quite a few Caribbean islands. There are no rocks, shells and very little sea weed on the beach. Most days the waves were quite large.Restaurants - They have a great variety and all were pretty good.I had low expectations being it is a all inclusive resort so I was plesantly surprised. We enjoyed the hamburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch when we didn't want to the leave the beach or pool.Hotel Staff - I was also extremely surprised that they all were amazing after reading so many negative reports. I speak very little spanish and language was never a barrier. You are always greated with a smile. We did try to tip a little but no-one appreared to be searching for a tip.Activities - We took advantage of the snorkling and horseback riding on the beach. Both were very fun. There is allot you can do there without spending additional $$I hope this helps some of you looking to visit the resort. Oh I forgot the only negative thing I experienced all week....bug bites,they were not mosquitos but sand fleas I think. I kept getting more and more over the coarse of the week I was there. Pretty amazing trip being this is the only real negative I can think of.

<Content>Great resort, but could be better. Hello, my wife and I stayed for a week at the Paradisus from May 19 to May 26 and had a fabulous time. Weather was perfect, little to no rain and highs in the high 80's. (Don't rely on Weather Channel, they predicted showers all week). In short, the resort is great but there are things they can improve upon. I will attempt to break my reveiw into logical categories for those wishing to stay here. Enjoy!THE GROUNDS:The lobby is beautiful and well appointed, but showing it's age in some places. The grounds are well manicured and kept and they were constantly working on them. You can either walk or take trams around. The trams are nice and open air but spew large amounts of smoke. Also the paths are also heavily travelled by workers in mopeds and other vehicles so it can get kinda trafficky and you're constantly dodging these vehicles. They should create a separate path for the service vehicles.The pool is fantastic and well kept. The swim up bar was fun. There were 9 restaurants and 4 bars that I counted. All the bars were nice, especially the one by the beach but the Fun Pub missed the mark. We tried to go there one night but it didn't open until 11 PM and it immediately turned into some sort of latin disco. Not fun.FOOD AND DRINK:The breakfast buffet was nice, lots to offer and even made eggs and omelets to order. The only offered 2 cereals, Fruit Loops and Frosted Flakes which was annoying.The lunch buffet was ok nothing to write home about. You really have to find what you're looking for. You can go the the Italian as an alternative but that gets old. The pizza tastes like Totino's.The dinner food is where we were the most disappointed. They tried to please everybody with theme restaurants but always seem to miss the mark. The Chinese food was gloppy, we had to ask for rice separetely. The steak house was ok, the Italian was ok, but the Japanese was horrible and the Mexican food dry. Don't bother with the French, it wasn't worth it. Room service is 24/7 and quick.Drinks were generous to the point where we had to ask them to cut it down. They didn't seem to understand our request to put in less alcohol so they gave us an extra shot! Oh well. There are only 2 beer choices - El Presidente and Heineken. El Presidente is so filling that we would bloat up after a couple of them. Heiney's much better. The wine was ok, not great.THE SERVICE:Overall service was good. There is the language barrier, the maids did not know a lick of English and when you dialed the phone to get any service you had to use some level of Spanish. Bartenders were great, although they didn't seem to know how to make a Vodka/Cranberry. Wait staff was good and friendly. I couldn't understand if they wanted me to speak Spanish or not, it you tried they they would try to have a full conversation which I would quickly get overwhelmed. But we made it through fine.BEWARE the medical facility. We had to go there to treat bug bites that were spreading. They did not tell us how much it would be other than the $90 fee for examiniation and ended up with a $300 bill. I don't think our insurance will cover it either.BEACH/AMENTITIES:The beach is wonderful. One of the most beautiful I've seen. It is built up now so it's one resort after another but all the resorts are low rise. There were plenty of beach chairs, probably since the resort was not at full capacity. The water is turquoise and warm, with some surf. We had a lot of fun using the free watersports. They screwed up our horse riding excursion the first time but we were able to get it in before we left. We took a catamaran booze cruise but it was kind of lame. Just motor around and then jump in the water, do some shots and head back.The entertainment was cheesy but what could you expect. The magician was laughable, we could see him toss items that he made disappear backstage and someone was seen clearly picking it up. It was actually funny. The Michael Jackson show was very entertaining.OTHER:I did not get sick but my wife got a little sick near the end. There is bottled water everywhere and we even used it to brush our teeth. That is probably why I didn't get sick.I think the tipping thing is overblown here. No one expected tips, but I did leave some at the end for the maid and threw some money around on the last night, but over all I'd say everyone received the same good service.

<Content>We had a great vacation with our 10 month old and 5 year old! Loved the resort! We just enjoyed a fabulous vacation at Paradisus Punta Cana Resort from May 12-May 19. I had read many reviews before we left, so I was a little concerned about some of the issues that were brought up.As for checking in, we had no problem. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was concerned that we would have problems with room availability, based on some of the warnings in the earlier reviews. It was not a problem, however. The second issue I was concerned about was staff friendliness. This was FAR FAR from a problem. The staff couldnt possibly be nicer! We knew many of them by their first names and they were so attentive to us and our children through the entire trip. We had our 10 month old and 5 year old with us, so we thought that it would be very difficult. That was not the case at all. The staff really helped us with our kids. They would constantly be bringing them food, drinks, activities, and they would never complain when were constantly asking them to store our baby bottles and warm them up for us!The resort was breathtaking! It is a eco-friendly resort, so you can expect lots of greenery, i.e. trees and exotic plants. They also had a little mini-zoo. It was so much fun for the kids! My daughter had exotic birds eating bird food out of her hands. They also had turtles, monkees, iguanas, etc. Something cute. They also had coconuts, so you could ask one of the gardners to cut open a coconut and you drink coconut milk right out the coconut. Pretty cool.The beach was spectacular! We walked along the beach and passed by many resorts. I definitely saw a difference as far as cleansiness with this resort. This resort had the cleanest beach, as far as I could tell. The beach was phenomenal. I have never seen such clean water and white sand. I also liked that the beach had big huts that you could sit under...and there were plenty of them. The pool was ENORMOUS! The whole family LOVED the pool. We spent a lot of time there. I dont think i have ever seen such a expansive pool before. It was very clean and well maintained. The food was pretty good, but I just had a couple of small issues with it. I really didnt like the buffets at Hibiscus. The breakfast buffet was not bad, but they had the same food everyday! The lunch buffet was not that good at all. Boring food! My favorite restaurants were the Mexican, Chinese, and French restaurants by far. This was my first all inclusive trip, so I realized that I would definitely opt for all inclusive from now on. Its so much easier than having to worry about cost or trying to find a place for every meal. Much easier!A few caveats- I dont normally have bad seasonal allergies, but boy did my allergies flare up! Thank goodness I took a took an anti-histamine with me! Also, I recommend taking mosquito spray and Imodium. There were a LOT of mosquitos and I have a ton of bug bites to prove it! Luckily I did not get sick, but its a good idea to have Imodium just in case. Also, be sure not to drink the tap water. I had to wash baby bottles, so I had to use bottle water to do that. If you dont have an infant, consider yourself lucky b/c that was a pain! Not a big deal, though, in the grand scheme of things. Also, if you are bringing an infant, I would recommend taking a bottle warmer with you. You can plug it in and warm up your baby's milk much easier than running over to the bar and having them place your bottle in warm water.The bottom line is that we had a fantastic time and we would go back to this resort. I highly recommend it, especially if you have little kids. There are many activities for the kids that they are sure to enjoy!

<Content>loved this resort i am writing this review, my first review ever, while i am staying at the paradisus punta cana. we are having the best time. there are 8 of us ranging in ages from 33 to 61 and we are having the best, most relaxing time here. we booked our package thru aa vacations, and at the time this included an upgrade to the royal deluxe service which is sooooooo worth it. everyone here is so pleasant and welcoming and really do go out of there way to help you. the beach is just beautiful, plenty of chairs and shady huts with lounge beds. so far we have had no problems with the food and drinks. the food i would say is ok, not 4 star but ok. the drinks are great. the rooms are very nice. the beds are comfortable. bring lysol for the room, it was a little musty when we arrived, but i sprayed and it has been fine. we have not been bothered by bugs at all. it is very hot and humid here in may, but we kinda expected that. we are here for the pool and beach, so it is fine. it is very humid at night and the restaurants are open air, so you will be warm during dinner.when you arrive, dont be surprised to see all the construction as you enter. we are way down by the beach, so we haven't heard anything, but we were a little shocked when we drove in. the ride from the airport is definitely a little scary, but our van was airconditioned, so it wasn't too bad. we have 3 days left here, so hopefully i will update this when we return home.

<Content>Hit or Mis, still a great place with my sister and I loosing our father, we needed a trip to get away from it all. so I was glad that when my sister told me about this resort from her travel agent, I was happy to go with her there.booking the trip was easy with her travel agent, and even with the short notice and having to get ready for it fast, all seemed to go well.Our flight was uneventful, the airport at PC was gorgous. customes and imigration was fast and easy, so we were on a mini van to the resort in under 1 hour, with bathroom breaks.the resort's gardens were fantastic. some were water gardens that even had turtles and fish in them. the staff at the check in was nice regardless that we arived at 1pm and check in was at 3pm...with y sister making a big stink about that. they handled her polightly.while we had to wait for our room, we had one of the best staff members at the resort give us a tour of the grounds, pool, and resteraunts. then we ate a quick lunch at the beach buffet/fish resteraunt before getting our keys to our first room.sadly the front desk forgot that we were not husband and wife, but brother and sister, and got a room on the first floor of building 15 that had a king size bed in it. while it did take an hour before thay could get a new room for us, they did upgrade us to a 2nd floor room with a jacuzzi, and canopy style beds...a far better room then the first.sadly, after a long trip to get there, my sister still didn't like the new room too because the jacuzzi was too big and you now had to have swinging doors between the toilet and sink, unlike a real door with a lock...so she wanted to change rooms again.maybe it's just me, but why would anyone care about a door when on vacation is beyond me????my sister wound up in her own room the next day after I told her off about how I'm on vacation, and don't need to hear such negitivity...I just wana have fun, tyvm.on day 2, while she was off getting her new room, I was at the pool. the bartenders worked hard to give everyone a good time and the greatest drinks. the pool was ultra large, and surounded by lush plants and trees. yet I sometimes wanted to just jump in and cross the pool fully clothed to reach the resteraunts as the walk around the pool can be long from the swim up bar.the resort has 9 places to eat, mostly open air...be prepared if you are looking for AC while you eat.some are great, some are not, but all try hard to give you a good meal.the Italian is the best, and opens for lunch at 12 noon, and is open till 3am.the steak house is good for breakfast, and the steaks are great at night.the Chinese was great on the first two nights, but the service was ultra slow on the 3rd. the food was normaly great there, so try it.the French and Japanese you need reservations, and the Japanese lost our reservations so we ate at the Brazilian. the service there wasn't the best, but the food was outstanding.speaking of service, or food, it always seend to be hit or miss. if you were lucky you got great service, but if you ordered the wrong item the food was off. if you ordered the right thing, it might be great, but then you might have ultra slow service.I'm used to slow service, and you wont be too fast if you had to work in such heat, but at times I did wait an unusualy long time between plates.as for trying to get alittle more active then just drinking at the pool bar, I did play a round of pool volley ball, and I also went snorkling twice. I also went horseback riding on the next to last day.they try real hard to make sure you have fun, and the people who run the snorkling/diving know the best places to take you to see tons of nice fish, sea fans, urchants, and starfish.they also have shows each night starting at 10pm. A little to late for me, but I did see the magic show on one night.I did speak with a few guests to see what they thought of the rooms and staff, and here is some of the things I've heared from them...some rooms have it's own querks about them, such as the fridge don't work, or the clock runs fast/don't work. some say they had ants in the rooms, and my room seemed to have mosquitos...but hey, you're not in your city aprtment at home.all in all, a great 4 star resort that you'll have fun on the beach or the pool.

<Content>Fun despite everything I cant believe some of the other reviews. I came here in April with some colleagues for a Presidents club (company sales team excursion).The negatives:The staff in the hotel are very friendly but the service is appalling. On arrival they offer you a drink; we ordered fruit punch and they brought something that resembled yellow sugar water instead. The bell boy took my colleagues and me with our luggage in the cart to the rooms, and then managed to forget my room number between the bottom of the staircase and the second floor.It took him 45 minutes to work it out, although I left my door open. Apparently he took my name off my colleague and called reception who had no record of my checking in. This became a pattern, when people called me at the hotel they not only had no record of me but they had no record of my room number. I could go on and on.Apparently I had an upgraded room, but it faced a building site for what seems to be another mega-hotel next to the Paradisus. The room is certainly spacious, but the furnishings are cheap and tired looking. If you are lucky enough to take a shower when there is hot water the pressure is pathetic. They keep the minibar well stocked with water, soda and beer. There are signs at the beach offering free scuba diving, but when I inquired about it they asked me to go to the next hotel along and ask.The quality of food ranges from unacceptable to OK. The breakfast serving areas resembles a hospital cafeteria. They ask the guests to follow a smart dress code in some of the restaurants which apparently includes Harley Davidson t-shirts and sneakers.The gardens are perfectly manicured with lush vegetation and fountains, but for some reason they pipe the most irritating music through speakers in fake rocks all over the complex.The cocktails in the hotel are free-flowing but are so sweet and artificial that they could send you into a diabetic coma. The postitives:The lobby is architecturally very impressive. The pool is enormous with a bar in the pool itself and the beach is lovely white sand. The golf course was in good condition and not too busy (it is included but somehow we still managed to spend $100 each in the shop on extras).Despite all my criticisms above, the place has a very fun atmosphere and it is hard not to enjoy yourself here. If you are looking for an elegant, 5 star experience then this is not the right place, but if you are looking for an all-inclusive resort where you can relax on the beach and have some fun, it's worth a visit.

<Author>SunfunNewJersey
<Content>Great Get Away...No Problems NJ First I will start by saying this was a great vacation - I read these reviews and tried to keep an open mind. Since we do travel frequently and have been to numerous islands, you have to go with a certain mindset. It appears that the majority of people who have problems book through the online sites. We always book through Freedom Travel in Randolph, NJ. They know their business and our travel has always been smooth. The bus ride to the resort was fun since we all had a few on the plane, then a few more when we landed at the airport and our driver stopped along the way for one last round. The did take our return vouchers on the way to the resort and told us to meet with Johnny (who I am sure is the time share rep) in the lobby either that night or the next morning and he would give us our return vouchers. We never went to meet him as we had no interest in purchasing a time share. He left us a phone message and we had no trouble getting back on the bus for our return to the airport. There is also a $10.00 tax you have to pay to when you land however there was no fee to get out. Check-in was quick and easy even though our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 1:00 p.m. the other couples that we were with rooms were ready. Really wasn't a big deal. I had a bathing suit in my carry on, we put our luggage in one of the other couples rooms and hit the beach. Again, it's the mindset. They tell you checkin isn't until 3:00 so I didn't expect to get in at 1:00 even though all our friends did. When you get there, it is so beautiful that you just have to take it all in. Since the lobby is a distance and not wanting to get back on the tram, they delivered the keys to our room when we got back. We had a first floor room which seem to be more humid than the second floor rooms. The room was clean which was really the most important to me. We spent virtually no time in the room. The second morning I noticed a few ants on the countertop in the bathroom. I called the front desk and within 10 minutes someone came and sprayed. Our room was somewhat musty/humid smelling but again, from reading the reviews, I expected it. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be so from reading the reviews, I had brought a can of Lysol. I srayed and opened the windows which seemed to help. The bugs are a problem at night so I kept everything closed at night. Again, not terrible. So if you can get one, request a 2nd floor room. Use the safe in your room for your money and valuables. While very few on the property speak English, it is relatively easy to communicate with all of the staff. As long as you know your basics (agua, bano, mas, etc.) you can communicate with the staff. They know what you want. Sign language and props go a long way. A couple of dollars means a lot to them so upon arrival, I tipped the maid a few dollars and we always had bottled water and extra towels. When we asked for something special or she stopped what she was doing to get what I wanted, I always gave her a few dollars. Again $2-$3 dollars at at time is a lot to them. We tipped the bartenders and even without Royal Serivce, we had service on the beach. We tipped at the restaurants as well. One couple we stayed with had upgraded to Royal Service but I'm not sure it's worth it. Yes, the pool in Royal service is nice and less crowded. However, the property was not crowded while we were there so it really wasn't an issue for us for the beach or for dinner reservations. Royal service may make a difference when the property is at capacity. We ate at the Italian (ok), steak (good), seafood (horrible service, the appetizers were ok but the main course (lobster) was not edible. We all ordered the same entree and across the board was bad but note this was our only bad meal), japenese (was the best meal). We did not get to the others. The beer of choice is Presidente (they also have Heineken) and their top shelf vodka is Absolut. Personally I prefer Kettle One and haven't drank Absolut in years. But again, it's the mindset. It wasn't terrible. If you smoke, cigarettes are unlimited (Marlboro and Marlboro lights) and are available at all the bars. All in all, we had a great experience. I would definitely pack the lysol and Immodium. While none of us were sick, a few needed some Immodium. We had brought other stomach rememdies however, they weren't needed. Also, I recommend bug spray or wipes. We didn't use them but I did get bit. I recommend being safe than sorry. I would recommend the resort - it is beautiful, the beach is awesome and clean, the rooms are clean and spacious and the service was good. If you are going to nitpick, I am sure you can find things to complain about. I had made myself crazy reading all the reviews...not knowing what to expect. I had just hoped after everything that I had read, that it would be clean and sunny. It definitely exceeded my expectations. If you walk down the beach, you can see the difference just in the beach at the Paradisus from the other resorts. It definitely is a step (if not more as I could only see the beach) above the rest. Overall we had a great experience. Go and enjoy - the place is beautiful, the people were nice and the service was good.

<Content>Great Beach, Great Drinks, Food...okay! Stayed at Paradisus April 9th-21st for our honeymoon. We upgraded to Royal Service. Unless you like being with the general population, RS is the way to go. The pool in RS is so nice, not crowded. The other pool was chaotic and loud. Our room was nice, problem w/ mosquitos....remember, we are in a hot and humid place, but please, dont want them in my room. Every night we slept w/ bug repellant. Royal Service lobby will cook breakfast and lunch to order which was great. Buffets were GROSS! Seriously, nothing good about the buffet. The Mexican restaurant was our favorite and the steak house was quite good too. 24 hour room service was a great feature. The pizza was fantastic. The beach by far was the best feature of this resort. The water and sand, the best! Laying out in the palapa and having someone bring you fruit, water and drinks, it was really a great thing. The staff were all very nice. Never a problem. We did tip. These people work very hard to please and I am sure they aren't paid what they are worth. Nightly entertainment was not very good but we didn't come for the entertainment. Really, you are paying for the beach, the service and the drinks. SO yes, it is definately worth it. We would definately come back. Although we live on the beach here in CA, the beach there is still in our thoughts:)

<Content>Great Time..... But Please Stay Away From The Casino My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon from May 7th thru the 13th. Okay first off the property itself was beautiful. There was a ton of flowers, coconut trees and ponds everywhere. Every day there were people working on the grounds cleaning or trimming something. Our room 2277 was good not great but good. No musty smell, the furniture was a little out dated but still nice and comfortable. Our bed was big and not as hard as people have complained about. The airconditioner was excellent it was always ice cold in our room. I thought that all of the restaurants were good, my favorite was the Japanese they cooked the food right at your table. If there is a vegetarian in your group beware there is not a whole lot for them to eat at most of the restaurants. Make sure you go to the bar by the buffet to make your reservations for the French and Japanese as soon as you can because they fill up fast. For lunch the options were a bit limited to the beach grill, Italian , and on occasion the Mexican restaraunts. There is a tram that can take you from the lobby to the rooms and beach, it comes around on a regular basis but the walk is not that bad right around 10 minutes from the lobby to the beach. The beach ... WOW it is paradise, beautiful blue ocean the sand just awesome!! There were always plenty of chairs on the beach and we didn't get to the beach til about 10 or 11 every morning. If you want to do some shopping on the beach if you walk down the beach either way there are some flea market type shops they are a bit of a walk though so be prepared for that, but the view is nice so we really didn't mind the walk. Whatever price they give you first cut it in half and go from there. The bars, there is a beach bar, a bar by the buffet, the pool bar, and the lobby bar all have great bartenders but the bartender at the beach bar was our favorite always singing and laughing just a fun atmosphere. One person I would like to thank is our server at the seafood restaruant and beach grill both out of the same area his name is Jesus Motto aka Jesus Johnny Be Good, this man went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed while we were at his restarunts. When we saw him out and about the resort he always made sure to stop and say hello, I just wish more of the staff here would follow Jesus's example. So please stop by and see him I am sure he will become your favorite as well. To get back to the food I only got sick once from the food I ate 2 bites from a salad from the steak house it didn't taste right and for about 2 hours the next day I had to stay inside the room but alittle Imodium AD and i was fine. Room service was ok you can order what ever you want and if you need beer just ask them for a 6 pack and in 10 minutes its there. Okay to the CASINO, ley me just say this if you value your money (and i don't mean don't gamble at all) its just if you want a fair chance to play any table game this is not the CASINO for you. I witnessed a dealer take a sizeable amount of money from a guest and place it in his tip jar, now whether it was an accident or not they didn't fix the problem they simply said that there was no wrong doing by the dealer. They even tried showing us the tape from the security camera but they were not showing us the right table but they calimed it was legit. The staff at the CASINO was horrible, as a guest in the CASINO I felt unwelcome like I was another sucker they could get money from. Outside of the resort about an 8 minute walk there is a really big and clean CASINO. I really enjoyed it there the staff was super friendly and the atmoshere was upbeat. Don't be afraid to go there at night it is a safe walk there and they will shuttle you back . So I hope this will help you make a decision on staying at this resort. I personally would go back in a heart beat and I am currently recommending it to all of my friends who are getting married. JUST STAY AWAY FROM THE CASINO.

<Content>Paradisus Paradise My boyfriend and I went to the Paradisus Punta Cana from May 8th to May 15th and had a great time.Check in was very easy. We were greeted by the bellhops and we went right to the check in. I think it took five minutes. The bellhops then brought our luggage to our room with the little golfcarts that they have around the resorts. As our bellhop brought us to our room, he toured us around a little and showed us what we needed to know and gave us tips. When we got to our room, we found it was very spacious and lovely (unfortunately, we didn't figure out how to put on our airconditioning until Sunday, but that was our own faults for not asking.). We had a corner room. the balcony was gorgeous (even better if you have a second floor room). The mini bar was stocked with Sodas and Waters, but I wrote a note and spoke with our maid and she took the sodas our and put in more water and beer (Heineken and El Presidente). It is helpful to speak some spanish, and the maids will be very generous if you make an attempt. I left a little gift and a dollar or two tip and they were great!The resort is very spacious. We did get lost the first day. There are signs at the major intersections as well as security to direct the golfcarts and maintenence vehicles. Once you get your directions set, then you can figure out where to go. The food was good at the restaurants. All of the restaurants use bottled water for drinking water as well as for the specialty drinks, so there is no need for concern on this part. The food is not always labeled at the buffetts, so if you have food allergies you may want to be careful. The menus are not always translated perfectly (appetizers in spanish is entradas, but they are listed as Entrees in english, so that was a little confusing, also camarones are shrimp but sometimes you would get squid instead!). Once again, it helps to have a spanish dictionary if you aren't familiar with the language.The beach and the pool were awesome. There is not a lot of service on the beach for drinks, but we did not find that a problem. We were more than willing to get up, walk around and see what was going on anyhow. You can get bottled water at the beach and pool bars as well. The pool bar staff and the beach bar staff were very accommadating and always had a smile, especially if you were kind to them. We didn't get the little beach beds under the covers but there were plenty of chairs. Also, we got up at 5:30 to watch the sunrise one morning, and we highly recommend that! Very beautiful!We went into the casino on our first night and only walked in and walked out. We are used to Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun, so someone who is unfamiliar with casinos may find this fun. I won't discourage you from checking it out, but we didn't find it interesting. When we walked past the fun club we found no one there, so hung out in the lobby bar. Most nights we were asleep by ten as we were just so tired, but we did try and check things out.The only restaurant we did not check out was the Chinese, otherwise, we found all the others pretty good. There are limited menu options on each menu, but since you have so many restaurants to choose from, we did not find that a problem at all either. Being open to trying new things is a must. If you are looking for American cuisine-burgers, fries you may be disappointed (as one other guest was that spoke with us).We did do two little trips. We did the Caribbean Festival Snorkeling, but found that there were too many people for a small area. If you haven't gone snorkeling before you may find this interesting, but if you are a person who has done a lot of traveling you may find it boring. The staff was very nice and accommodating however, and tried to make the trip fun. We enjoyed it, but were not over thrilled by the trip.We also did the ATVing with Ranch Nuevo which was excellent! Highly recommended. We went at 8am (we are early risers) and had our own trip with just us and our Tour Guide. Going to the Cave and swimming there was a once in a lifetime experience. The water was So clear, and the locals will speak with you as well. There is a store on the way that you have to stop in, and our tour guide was nice enough to tell us not to buy anything there because it was very expensive. We did buy a couple things by the cave (a lot of the stuff looked used or found but they were very kind and we haggled with them just to support them). The beach in Macao was also beautiful and we stopped and swam there for a bit too. Another little table was set up for selling items and they offered a free necklace. A lot of the store owners will offer free gifts so you feel bad and buy something. We usually did, but you really have to bargain with them! Also, tip your tour guide! They don't make too much but are very happy to speak with you about everything!Shops-be careful. If you walk on the beach, we had a lot of shop keepers that were aggressive. The best thing to do is say that you don't have any money with you (but that doesn't always work). We went into the Bavaro Beach shops, and really had to haggle too. All the shops have basically the same stuff, some a little less, some a little more, but all trying to get out as much money as possible. Be kind and they will be kind to you. We made the mistake of saying we would be back, and they would wait for you. So, be careful. Also, don't wear any jewelry when you go (or anything expensive) because they will size you up for how much you can afford!This vacation is for the open minded. If you are expecting people to speak english all the time and American food, honestly, it is not for you. If you are open minded easy going, you will be all set!! Enjoy!!

<Content>Excellence May 8th - 13th, here's what you need to know... Just back from Excellence Punta Cana, May 8th - 13th. We had a great time, the place is awesome. The previous reviewer is absolutely correct so I won't rehash her great review. Here a few tidbits which we found out (sometimes the hard way).1. Airport Transfer - We booked our trip through Orbitz and did not select the transfer option. We ended up having the resort book a cab for us which was $60 each way for two. Probably could have saved some money with a tour operator. By the way, The DR charges $10 to come into the country (cash). Allegedly, they charge $20 to leave, but nobody ever collected ours.2. Calling the States - Here's where we got screwed. If you have Verizon, you can get a signal and be charged roaming. Otherwise, you can call from your room, at $4.00/minute. There is another option, a toll-freenumber where you type in your credit card number and they connect you. DO NOT USE THIS! I tried multiple time to ask at the desk how much this was, and got blank stares. I figured, it's got to be cheaper, right? We got back to the states and found out that this was about $7.00/minute. In addition, our card was suspended due to suspicious activity. We're still trying to figure this out. The other option is to go to the internet cafe and rent a phone. This is a cell phone which rents for $5/day and then calling card are $10/21 minutes. I wish would we have done this. I also wish somebody would have told me this, instead of which waitress they absolutely loved......3. Internet access - Buildings 6-14 have wireless access and you can also get on the web in the main lobby. But, do your relationship a favor and leave your geek box at home!4. Swim up Bar - My favorite part. Building 6-7directly face the swim up bar and therefore, make it easy to go to the bathroom. They are also close to the lobby/restaurants, so it might be worth requesting.5. Tipping - I tipped a couple of bucks to the maid, bartenders, and waiters after a good meal. Be warned, the service at some of the restaurants is S L O W, particularly Agave, but hey man, you're on vacation. If you can catch the minibar guy, give him a couple of bucks and he'll change out the Presidente with Bud Light, and Red Bull.6. Beer - I hope you like Presidente. It's not bad, especially after 10 of them. It is really the only beer you can get, except at the Martini bar and a couple of others, where you can occasionally find a Bud or Bud light.7. Restaurants - You can find this elsewhere. I will say that by far, the best restaurant is the French Restaurant. Men have to wear pants at all except the Grill. Leave your cargo pants at home big guy, you're 30 now.8. Miscellaneous - You can swim up to the grill and ask for nachos. Get up early and snag a primo spot by the pool. Play beach volleyball. Go horseback riding (the free one) but don't count on ANY instruction. Also, they try to sell you stuff at the end. Go to the huts to the left on the beach. Tell the hustlers that you're going to see Nancy (that way they'll leave you alone) and she will give you a deal on stuff. About 1/2 the price as within the resort. Cigars seem authentic. If it's your anniversary (like us) tell them ahead of time. They will have champagne in your room and give a couple other percs...I heard the shopping excursion was a rip off. Um, duh.9. One word of caution, I don't know what would have happened if we got sick or needed medical attention, there is a doctor around, but it would be a scary place to need some healthcare.10. The casino is a scam, and not very fun. At least losing is Vegas has a certain oh well, it's Vegas feel.We had a blast and have nothing negative, except the phone thing, to say. Have fun!!!!! Also check out [--] for official tips.Let me know if I can help....

<Content>wouldn't send my worst enemy here Don't know where to begin. This was by far the worst vacation ever. The hotel rooms had ants, we called the front desk and no one showed up to fix the problem. No one spoke english. Don't bother tipping because it does not get you anything. The food was inedible. Outdoor restaurants had flys on all the tables. This was the only vacation that I actually lost weight on! We had royal service which was an absolute joke. Butler never came when we called or came 5 hours later with our pillows.Bartenders were rude. Save your money

<Content>One of our all time best!! We returned from Paradisus, Punta Cana on April 17th. We absolutely loved this hotel! We have been to Punta Cana three times and loved each hotel, but this one was by far the best. CHECK-INOur reservation was for Royal Service, and the bellboys immediately brought us to the RS check-in. It was a 5 minute deal and we were off to our room. Absolutely gorgeous! We were glad we had RS because we later found out the hotel was overbooked, and people were sent next door to the Princess, and were not happy. ROOMS Our room was huge, with a jacuzzi, bath and shower; king size bed and couch for watching tv. Our room was on the beach; in #30 building. Great location; close to the beach, pool,and most restaurants.BEACH The beach is spectacular! Always able to get a Bali bed and palapa every day. If you are RS, you can go to their pool or beach area. We chose to go to the regular beach most days! Always drink and meal service on the beach. No sea weed on the beach; the best beach we've seen,and we're well travelled. We were RS, but we never felt we had to be; everyone was wonderful! The grounds are gorgeous, and they even have a small mini-zoo, with beautiful tropical birds, huge iguanas and monkeys. RESTAURANTS  There are 10 restaurants and we loved them all.Breakfast was great at the buffet (Hibiscus), but we never went for lunch or dinner. Japanese and French you need to make reservations for. Our favorites were the Chinese, ( get the spring rolls) and Rodizio (Brazilian) awesome! Unlike other all-inclusives, the food was very good.TOURS We only took one tour , and that was to Saona Island. We really enjoyed this. They take you by bus to Bayahibe, then board a motor boat to the Natural Pool, then on to Saona and a nice lunch with open bar, then onto a catamaran (open bar) then back to the hotel.Hotel Amenities We went horseback riding, used paddleboats, kayaks, went parasailing (extra, but worth it, $85 for 2)  We loved this place and will be back. Go, and I'm sure you'll enjoy.

<Content>Not a 5 star resort; maid had sticky fingers I was at Paradissus from April 22-29, 2007, along with my wife and two kids (1 and 2.5 year old). By no means is this resort geared to children of such a young age; though they never advertised as such. The Kids Club starts at 4 years old, and the babysitters speak poor English, which made it difficult for us to find time to ourselves. Most of the staff were very friendly towards our kids, as it seemed a large proportion had kids of their own, with their families living hours outside Punta Cana.Our garden view suite was awful (building 10, ground floor). The roomwas extremely musty (upon arriving home we had to wash our clothes twice to get the smell out), the shower didn't work and the tv was about 20. Not exactly what we envisioned a five star resort to be like. Further, one morning I left my wallet on top of the tv while at breakfast, and came back, room made, and US$150 missing from my wallet. Initially I chalked it up to miscounting my money, but when the next day I noticed another US$120 missing, I called security. They ran an electronic audit on whom had entered our room, and the only person had been the maid. She denied it, and from their point, the case was closed. The manager didn't even try to make amends, but rather said you should have used the safe. In hind sight, that was the right thing to do, but then again, you shouldn't have to worry about your personal belongings in your own room. Bottom line - use the safe provided.Food - average - typical resort food. Though nice to have the varietywith all the a la carte dinner restaurants.Beach - by far the best beach I have laid foot on. Gorgeous blue water, sprawling waterfront, and cabana;s with mattresses made it unique to other resorts. Beach bar great to have a few afternoon drinks at.Scuba diving - equipment/diving included in all-inclusive package. I did two, 30 minute dives reaching a maximum depth of 40 feet. Visibility was about 30 feet, aquatic life was average. Great comraderie with other divers. Non-licensed divers were able to go out, albeit not to same depths - I am a bit skeptical of this practice.

<Content>Want to go again! We spent 5 nights at Paradisus. It was absoultely great. The resort common areas - lobby, pool, restaurants, etc. are beautiful. The landscape around the resort is also amazing. Room - we had a junior suite which I am really glad we paid a little extra money for the space. The room was good, nothing special. My one complaint was the bed. VERY hard. At the beginning of the week we tipped the house keeper and left a note to please make sure we had plenty of bottles of water (and that worked out really well)! There is a mini referigerator in the room. One awesome thing is that room service was included! The menu was small, but so great to have food/snacks/beer/wine, etc. delivered right to your room!Restaurants - The restaurants were pretty good. We liked the Mexican. The Japanese was okay. The seafood restaurant was great. The breakfast buffet was good. Lots to chose from. We didn't eat at the steak house, but heard great things about it. The beach - AMAZING! Our room was close to the beach and the pool. It was beautiful and very clean. They had great lounge furniture as well - definitely the nicest on the beach! The beach bar is fairly close, but you do have to get your own drinks there (no servers on the beach). Our favorite... the pool bar! The pool was huge and the bar was a great place to hang out. The bartenders are awesome - very fun. Nightlife - um, well depends what you like. If you like a party / club atmosphere, then this is the wrong place. If you are cool with hanging out at the bar meeting some new people, then you are in luck. It's not a huge nightlife scene. We were usually so exhausted (from eating, drinking and laying in the sun all day) that hanging out was perfect. They have a casino. It's very small, but still not a bad place to hang out for an hour or so. I know some singles that were there left the resort and went down the street to a club (not sure where). Overall, awesome trip! Defininitey would reccomend! Oh, and a few tips.... Bring the bug spray (they come out at night). Don't waste your time getting sucked in to the vacation club presentation (basically a time share pitch) unless you have $34,000 to put down up front. Brush up on your Spanish. The staff can communicate with you, but their English is VERY limited! It was fun, it's what made it authentic!!

<Content>We had a great time!!! We just returned from a week at the Paradisus. Overall our experience was very positive. My husband and I were traveling with our 6 1/2 year old daughter. We were not sure what to expect, as very few of the Trip Advisor reviewers had traveled with their families. My daughter had a blast!!! We did NOT take advantage of the kids club. It looked very small and had very limited offerings for the kids. I was told by someone we were traveling with that she had obserrved that there was very poor supervision of the children during an evening movie. I was told by a Sol Melia employee that this is one of three Sol Melia properties in Punta Cana and is NOT one that caters to families. My daughter had a GREAT time with children she met at the resort. She enjoyed climbing the Space Mountain climber in the pool, swimming in the waves, snorkeling off the coast and reading and playing with her new friends. We also met some wonderful people and enjoyed their company while we were there! So, in regards to children, DON'T expect a lot of structured activities for your children- because this is NOT the place to go if that is what you are looking for.Snorkeling- we took advantage of the free 1-2 hour snorkeling trip off the coast. The reef is mostly dead. There were few varieties of fish, but what we saw was fine. We did not sign up for any of the excursions to the other parts of the Island. I was told by someone who went to Catalina Island that it was NOT worth the very long trip there (1 1/2 hours by bus and then a 1/2 hour boat ride). He said the reef there was not in good shape either, thus the snorkeling not good.Food- our experience was that it was fine- nothing great. We enjoyed the steak house and Mexican restaurant. The Japanese steak house was a nice experience as we met some wonderful dining companions, but the food was only fair. I had a good meal at the French restaurant (shrimp appetizer, fish entree) but my husband did not (pork and duck). Have a Chi Chi at the bar- yummy. Also, the grounds keepers were finding us coconuts to bring to the bar in which to put our drinks. That was fun!Pool- the pool and grounds were spectacular!! Very lush and well-groomed! The pink flamingos were beautful- find them near the French Restaurant. And yes, despite what the signs say, everyone reserves their spot at the pool by about 8-9 am. This was not an issue for us, since we went to breakfast at 8am anyway and were usually swimming by 9am. I would imagine this would be a major drag for those that like to sleep in!!!Staff/Service/Cleanlieness- the staff were generally very friendly and seemed to enjoy talking with us. Many of these employees live in Santa Domingo which is 3 hours away. They work at the resort for 13-14 days and then return home for 3 days. The staff work VERY hard, but at times, there just are not enough of them to do all the work!!!!!! I witnessed a VERY RUDE man berating a bartender for not serving his son in a timely manner. I was horrified how impatient and rude some people were. We did have one frustrating experience in which we needed to ask 6 times for an iron!!!!! I spoke with the customer service manager about it later and was shocked at his remark that nothing's perfect!! I do think that service was lacking in some respects. I have come to realize that a 5 star Carribean hotel is NOT the same as a 5 star American hotel!!!!!I did hear from a few people that the resort had over booked and that they had to spend a night at a neighboring hotel. One family went to the Paradisus Palma Real for a night- which they did not like as much as the Paradisus Punta Cana despite it being more expensive.I agreed with prior comments about the quality of the accomodations. Our room was tired looking in that there were scratches on doors, minor stains on the walls in places, etc. I was told by a Sol Melia employee that the resort will be getting renovated as soon as the finish building another 170 rooms they have startedVacation Club- we sat in on the Sol Melia vacation club presentation. We had been intrigued by time shares but had never been to a presentation. The presentation was about 1 1/2 hours. There was mild pressure but nothing we didn't expect. We received $70 in resort money to spend and I enjoyed using it to have my nails done! Spa- the spa and gym are small but decent. Both my husband and I had massages. I had mine by the spa pool and it was great!! One annoying feature was that you could NOT use the lockers in the locker room if you were only using the gym- they were only for use of people having massages. EEK!!Beach- beautiful!!!! The Paradisus had BY FAR one of the nicest beaches of all the neighboring resorts. All in all- despite some minot issues, we had a GREAT time!!!

<Content>spring family trip We spent a week at the Paradisus Punta Cana. It was a beautiful resort , all-inclusive. The rooms were lovely and clean. The food was abundant and very tasty. This resort was full to capacity but it never felt crowded. We were able to get beach chairs and pool chairs whenever we wandered down to either place. The pool was clean and beautifully landscaped with a swim up bar that our 12 year old son really enjoyed. Virgin pina coladas and margaritas were very popular. There were two restaurants that required reservations, French and Japanese and both were very good. We always ate early so we did not have to wait for a table. There was plenty to do if you wanted to be active, horseback riding was included,as well as windsurfing, catamarans, snorkleing and all sorts of beach activites, volley ball, soccer, dance classes. The only down side to this vacation, is that it caters to a very European crowd and we noticed that they tend to enjoy smoking a lot. Cigarettes were available at all bars, offered in cups at the counter. People smoked in all restaurants which could ruin a meal if you are not a smoker and don't like the taste of smoke as you are eating. Our son is 12 and he did not meet many children in his age category, although there were plenty of kids, most of them younger. The staff was friendly and responsive, the night time entertainment was okay, not great. The alcohol was topshelf and flowing. All in all it was a wonderful vacation, relaxing, no stress, beach clean , pinkish sand, and nice to take long walks on.

<Content>Not what I expected DATES: April 12- April 16VISITING FROM BALTIMORE, MDMy boyfriend and I traveled to the Dominican for my sisters wedding. We booked it through a travel agent so we thought all would be well. When we got there they informed us that the hotel had been overbooked and they needed to send us next door to another hotel. This would not have been a big deal but my sister was getting married the night we arrived and we had to be ready. They pulled us aside and told us we had to go and that they would reimburse us $200 for the night. At that point we were not worried about the hotel, we just needed to get somewhere to shower and change. We ended up going to my sister and brother in laws room to get ready. They did not mind but we did not want to impose. By 11 pm they called to let us know that our room, which was Royal Service was ready. By this time we had the tran drop us off at 3 different locations because they did not know where our room was. It was very hot and a pain to carry all of our luggage around in a dress.Finally we were taken to our room. It was definitely not classified as Royal Service but was liveable. There was hair in the tub and marks on the floor from glasses that have been left by the tub. It was not clean at all and I wore my flip flops in the shower. The shower water was FREEZING and hot water came out only from the bathtub faucet. I had to deal with the cold because there was no way I was sitting in the filthy tub. We also saw a bunch of huge palmetto bugs in our room. They are big and black and are so fast. We saw one crawl under the bed and could not sleep at night. As far as the food goes, it was decent for being in the Dominican. Our favorite place was the Steak House. They had good salads and vegetables. Stay away from the seafood restaurant. It was horrible. It also would have been nice to have a variety of drinks. It was pretty cut and dry. The Beach was beautiful. There were plenty of lounge chairs and cabanas if you wanted shade....very relaxing. The pool was really nice too. The swim up pool bar was awesome. We met alot of really nice people from all over. The nightlife was non existent. We watched a few shows and hit the casino. The club was a nightmare. It was very small and not entertaining. The most fun we had was at the lobby bar and at the bar right outside of the casino. Overall, for the cost of this trip it was not that bad. We paid $2300 for 2 of us which included flight, hotel, and all inclusive. You pay for what you get. I would probably not visit this place again but it was a nice relaxing get away. I would not recommend going here if you are not with your significant other.

<Content>Beware!!! You May Not Have a Room Went to Paradisus for 6 days for a wedding. Upon arrival with two other couples, we were told they were overbooked and we HAD to stay at Bavaro Princess next door. We argued for 5 hours as the rooms they showed us next door were horrendous (cockroaches, no AC in one room, musty smell). We were told repeatedly that we needed to sign a waiver and would get $100 a night. Long story short, we stayed next door one night and came back next day for more arguing. After Bride to be thretened a lawsuit, all of us (along with about 10 other couples arriving that day) magically had rooms. Be warned, do not go here. If you go and they try to scam you, DO NOT sign that waiver. We ran into many others who did and had no recourse to get back.

<Content>Loved our Stay Here! My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel and loved our stay there. We didn't really participate much in the hotel activities or outside excursions so I can't comment on either of those items. But we thoroughly enjoyed sitting at the pool or beach and reading a good book. We had great weather except for the first day, but we didn't let it dampen our spirits. Overall, the service was great and we enjoyed all of the restaurants located on the property. If you stayed longer then a week you might get bored with the selection, but we liked having so many choices of cuisine to choose from and for the most part we always had a great meal.We seem to always compare this vacation to all of our others and so far this was our favorite one! We hope to go back some day.We even considered having a destination wedding there if that tells you how much we loved it!

<Content>Bait and Switch -- Illegal in the U.S. Apparently not in Punta Cana We arrived with a guaranteed reservation on April 9, 2007 for 5 nights. In the lobby people were fighting with the front desk -- at each station. The hotel had overbooked; not informed any guests that they were sold out --even though one had a guaranteed reservation. They offered you a room in the hotel next door (not a 5 star hotel) and a discount of $100 per night. If I wanted to stay at a lesser class hotel for less money I would have booked that. They then had a legal waiver for me to sign already prepared (which I did not sign) and the hotel next door already had our reservation set up. I discovered that this happened to about 30 folks a day. On the beach it was being called the double bracelet club. They even bumped a wedding party that had booked a year in advance (the bride and groom were permitted to stay at the resort). This type of bait and switch is not what I would expect from a hotel rated 5 star. I was told in Punta Cana I had no recourse (it took us 12 hours to reach this destination). I would suggest you book another hotel or contact the General Manager of this hotel, Mr. Francisco Castillo and ask him to send you a written guarantee that you will have a room. It did not matter whether you booked through their website or through a travel agent. They didn't have rooms. This hotel does not deserve a 5 star rating on any website. This type of experience when you are going on vacation is unacceptable and the public should be aware should you still chose to go to the Paradiscus Punta Cana that most likely you will not have a room there. They also cater to large conventions and obviously adding to the room block is more important than individual travelers. I spoke to the sales manager who informed me that there were hundreds there for the convention. I was told by the reservation agent for the Sol Melia properties that conventions were not booked during this time of year. My advice is to find another property with a U.S. chain that will in fact make good on their reservation.

<Content>Held Hostage in Punta Cana We arrived at the hotel on April 11 and waited over 4 hours before they told us they had no rooms available. During those 4 hours, no one suggested that there was a room availability problem. The manager told us that it was our problem and there was nothing he could do but put us up at the Bavaro Princess. We reluctantly went there, as we had no choice. That is a whole other review (but I would never go there either). We called Amex last night and after finally getting through, we booked a flight home today. I will never go there again.

<Content>Beautiful Paradise Just back from our first AI and first trip to PC. We did Family Concierge with our 10 yr old for a week. I can't say enough about the physical beauty of this resort. The plantings are lush, colorful and meticulously maintained. Every staff member met us with a smile and a desire to make our stay everything we wanted it to be. The beach is beautiful too, with waves to either jump over or ride. These things made up for areas where there were shortcomings.First off: set up a transfer to and from the airport. Do not, repeat, do not take a taxi. We did on the return trip and all I can say is thank goodness for seatbelts. I felt like I was in a chase scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark! Take the shuttle, ANY shuttle!Food: this is where the 5 star rating flounders (no pun intended). The breakfast buffet was good, pretty much the fare you would expect. Look for Freddie the coffee guy - he'll be smiling and singing. We ate lunches at the Caribbean Grill for fresh grilled samon steaks and other fish, good paella, rotisserie chicken (they had a bowl of great BBQ sauce if the chicken was dry), and a salad bar (iceberg ,cucumbers, tomatoes,shredded carrots). There was always fresh fruit, cheese and bread. There was someone preparing dishes of pasta with your choice of sauce. In another area they were cooking up burgers, hot dogs and sausage, but we didn't try these. Dinner was harder. Il Romantico was inedible and the setting was tired and depressing. The steakhouse was good, also the Brazilian Rotisserie and the Japanese (which we thought was the best) There was a general lack of vegetables, except potatoes, so we relied on the salad bar and fresh fruit.Our room was a corner room in the Family Concierge area, kind of behind the pool, not far from the beach, and on the second floor. Try to get a 2nd floor corner room if you can - the balcony is bigger and a nice place to sit and enjoy the lush surroundings and have a drink while getting ready. The room was clean and every one of requests fulfilled. The rooms do need a bit of updating, but it didn't deter from our enjoying ourselves.The resort was operating at full capacity for spring break, but never once did we feel crowded, or have to wait, or unable to find a space to be alone. A lounge chair in or out of the sun on the beach could be found at any time of the day. Beach beds in the shade were a little harder to come by - you'd have to stake your claim early, I think. And chairs around the pool were the toughest. But, as nice as the pool was, there are pools at home. That beautiful beach was the place to be.I could go on (obviously), but if you want/need more info, just let me know.magicspann

<Content>One of the BEST island resorts!!! After reading numerous reviews, I had my concerns re the Paradisus Punta Cana.....WOW, in my opinion, people do not appreciate an excellent property in the islands. I went with my teenage son and we both had a 6 star experience. There is so much to do, should you choose or do nothing at all and relax and be catered to for as long as you like. The service is wonderful, and I do recommend Royal Service if you want to upgrade. For an all-inclusive the food is very good, and in general, the food is very good. Lots of diversity of people, and everyone was there to have fun and did!!! We are so so glad we went to the Paradisus Punta Cana.

<Content>great vacation!!! I have never written a review before but since I had read all the reviews before we booked I thought I should. My 13 year old daughter and I arrived for a week long stay on February 23. We booked with Liberty Travel and could not have been happier-other than some cloudy days. After we landed it was a little confusing trying to locate our transportation to the hotel. The hotel lobby was beautiful and check in was a breeze. I had read some complaints about delays in getting a room but as we did not arrive at the hotel till 5:30pm everything went smoothly.The only issue I had was the map of the hotel which described all the restaurants, policies and amenities of the hotel was in Spanish. I asked for the English version and was told we don't have one. Kind of annoying. The grounds were impeccable and the grounds keeping staff were very friendly. Our room was immaculate at check in and the following morning I left a $10 tip for the maid asking for bottled water and coffee everyday. Everyday upon return to the room was an overabundance of both as well as a super clean room! The beach was beautiful no issues with cleanliness at all. The place was packed as it was spring break but never an issue of getting a place to sit. The food was okay, my biggest problem was a severe shellfish allergy and all the food descriptions were in Spanish at the buffet. When attempting to explain my situation to a waiter I felt that they did not understand the question and just say yes or no not realizing the implications. The best were Chinese and buffet for us. I think that the staff there want a tip upfront before you are served to kind ofensure quality service which is not my policy. I will tip you after I am served on the quality and attentiveness of the staff, not before. The regular waiters at both restaurants received generous tips. The only other problem which was not a big deal was on the hotel website and confirmed through my agent, we were told they had wireless internet. I assumed that meant in my room -but it is in the lobby at $5 an hour. Some people still have to work while on vacation and I found this to be a little inconvenient. All in all great trip, would recommend.

<Content>Great beach and food, shame for the rooms. After ending up stranded at the neighbouring Grand Palladium by Expedia (we never received the booking from Expedia and have no room left), I helped myself as Expedia would not help, tipped one of the employees and accepted a junior suite for 4 nights at the rack rate of $435 a night all inclusive at the Paradisus. After 4 nights, I booked via Sol Melia website for $335 a night a junior suite with jacuzzi.The good:Beach: very nice beach, several beach mattresses very comfy but to be reserved by towel early, long chairs being less confortable without padding.Food: several restaurants (Japanese, French, Chinese, Mexican, Brazilian meat, buffet, Italian) with good quality food, good choice of wines (from South American to French/Spanish), service variable. Not perfect by all means (no Jasmin tea available in the Chinese), menu of the Italian available as room service.Bars: good cocktails and drinks.Green: a lot of green / nature on the grounds of the hotel, with a mini jungle between the recpetions and the villas.The bad:Rooms: not 5 stars, maybe 3. The rooms are all large (only junior suites in the hotel anyway) with terrace, but the first one had a musty smell probably due to water infiltrations (re-painting visible on the ceiling and was very much 70-early 80ies, with brown marble, worn out furniture and less efficient A/C. Comfortable mattress though, which is key in an hotel. The second room was better decorated, had a combined jacuzzi tub/shower, a remote for the TV from a different brand than the set, hence not working, and a cheap and hard mattress. Despite 2 calls to the room service, changing it for one softer would not happen.Noise: small cars drive around from early to late around the complex, to bring guests from the reception to the villas. Prepare ear-plugs, especially as some guest talk loud on the streets and kiddies obviously will not behave. So get a room on a first floor, looking away from the small roads and not too close to the pool.Service: variable. Staff is mostly friendly and smiling, but does not always master well English and feels fast overwhelmed, probably due to lack of training. Reception staff was consistently useless. Clientele was mostly US families or young or older couples. Nothing much to see outside the hotel.To sum up: if you are lucky with your room, nice beach and food can make make for a nice beach bum stay but I would not rate this 5 stars, as probably most hotels on the island. Much better experience in Asia.

<Content>Good Value This is the first time i am writing a review about a vacation after reading numerous contradicting reviews from travelers on the the same properties. Our family just got back from 1 week at the Paradisus Punta Cana and we were overall satisfied with the value that was provided. The check in was very fast although we arrived 2 1/2 hours before the actual check in time which is 3 pm. The whole property is lush with tropical vegetation and very well maintained. It is big and the walk from the lobby to the beach takes about 8 to 10 minutes. But once you have arrived at the beach you are greeted with one of the greatest beaches in the whole world. And readers believe me, I have seen beaches all over the world. All the restaurants with exception of the Japanese a la carte restaurant are located in a big complex close to the beach and if somebody does not find anything to his or her liking they better stay home. This is not your Gourmet Temple in New York, Chicago or Toronto and people who would probably pay for a dinner about a quarter or half of the amount they pay for a whole weeks worth of vacation, including the flight and 4 rounds of golf, should reevaluate their expectations. The food is the best I had in the Dominican Republic in the 3 times I was there. I just have to shake my head about the reviewer who said the food at the buffet restaurant was horrible. The drinks are excellent and plenty and they even have Perrier water which I have never seen in an All-Inclusive Hotel. The Service personel was very friendly and always eager to satisfy our wishes- a dollar here and there helps a lot. The pool area is very nice with several sections for adults and kids and never felt crowded and had a great vibe at the poolbar.Smokers are in heaven, every bar gives out free cigarettes and you even get Dominican cigars at the El Romantico Restaurant.So far I probably sound like I am promoting the resort but here's the complainingThere was absolutely no service at the beach, we had to walk to the beach bar to get our drinks. Our mini bar was out of water after the second day and never got restocked, also no beers in the mini bar. We could have complained about this but solved the problem by taking water from the bars when we got back to the room. The rooms are starting to look a bit long in the tooth and the sliding doors to the balcony could not be closed, also there is no mosquito screen which would be be greatly needed.The closet is not very big and has also problems with the sliding doors - not moving smoothly. People with wheelchairs will have a hard time getting around the resort. The only ramps I saw were at the Hibiscus Buffet Restaurant and and the Main Lobby leading up towards the Bar area. People who like to see the shows had to wait until around 10.30 pm for the entertainment to start which is very late in my opinion if you think about families with younger children or older folks who like to go to bed earlier. I think a 9 to 9.30 pm start would be more appropriate for the shows. All those things could not spoil our experience since we considered them minor and not worth to bother about, but in the overall rating they are serious enough that I would give the resort a 4.5 star rating for Dominican standard instead of 5 as advertised..If anyone has questions about this resort, please contact me

<Content>friendly and beautiful resort My 19 year old daughter and I just returned from 4 days at the Paradisus in Punta Cana and I have to say it was nicer than I expected. This is the first time I chose to stay at an all-inclusive resort and it worked out well for us. Will I do this again?- maybe. The property is large and beautifully maintained. It is a stark contrast to the main area of the DR. Unfortuntately it is not safe to wonder around the countryside for foreigners. We were told this by the staff and there seems to be no reason for them to keep you on the property since everything is included in your stay. The beach was mostly clear of seaweed, which I saw was a complaint by some reviewers of other resorts. There were plenty of lounge chairs beach front and they have large cushioned beds as well if you get there early enough. The beach is long and great for walking. The pool is clean and beautiful and so large that it never seemed crowded. It does however have short hours- 8-6- and the pool bar closes at 6 as well. We stayed in the pool until the maintainence men asked us nicely to leave around 7. Our room was fine with comfortable beds (pillows were lacking), 2/stage bath with granite counters, a nice living area and patio. Noise was never a problem. We had a small stream of ants one day and maintenence came within minutes and sprayed. No one could ever complain that there is not enough to do. You couldn't do everything they have included in the price if you tried. We went horseback riding, took dance lessons, water erobics, cooking demos, played in the casino, listened to music each night at the lobby bar, took in several of the nightly shows and still had time to soak in the pool or lie out at the beach. There is a daily listing with times that you can pick up at the beachside activity center. The dance lessons were particularly fun- the staff is hilarious and easy going. It was also interesting because we speak almost no Spanish and most of the lesson is taught in Spanish. Speaking of the language, most front desk staff, wait and bar staff speak some english, The housekeeping does not, nor do the spa technicans. It is not a problem if you are friendly and understanding. This is their country! Everyone seemed to be trying hard to make our stay a good one. When I used the phone I would ask immediately if the person spoke any english and if they did not they transferred me to someone who could.  The spa was great. The prices were reasonable for a resort and the services professional. Freddy is the manager and he was very nice- truly concerned if we enjoyed the service. I also didn't feel that I had to tip excessively. The staff always seemed pleased when I did but were not insulted if not. An extra dollar or 2 at the bar brought a smile and quicker service and I usually left 3-4 for dinner. I left 3 each day in our room. I tipped 15 % at the spa.  I think the only complaint I have is that the food is only OK. This seems to be the theme with most reviews on the DR and I agree. There are 10 restaurants so you have variety but quality is lacking. Remember to reserve the japanese or french restaurants right away- the desk is near the front of the steakhouse.

<Content>Gorgeous beach!!!! My daughter and I just returned from Paradisus Punta Cana. It was fantastic! We enjoyed playing in the ocean and relaxing on the beach all morning, and at the pool all afternoon. Only complaints were that we had lukewarm water (at best) for showers and that at the buffet, the hot food never seemed hot enough, and the cold food never cold enough. Staff was very pleasant and attentive - it would have really helped if we had spoken Spanish, though.

<Content>Loved it! I stayed at this resort the week of February 16th to the 23rd. I had read some reviews on the site, and was a little hesitant, but my worries were calmed as soon as we saw the beautiful resort. This place is unbelievable. The grounds are so well maintained, the beaches are cleaned every morning, and you don't even have to worry about stepping on seaweed. It truly was paradise. Upon arrival, we were served ice cold champagne in the Royal Service lounge, which was wonderful after the hot bus ride to the resort. We were told that only one of our rooms was ready early and that the second one would not be ready until 3 pm, which was check in time. It ended up being ready around 4 30. Waking up the third day, our air conditioner was leaking, and there was a huge puddle across our floor. We called down to the front desk, and they sent someone up within the next hour to take a look at it. We were informed that the problem was worse than they had originally thought, and we could move rooms if we wanted, which we did.The staff was extraordinarily nice. Everyone was smiling constantly. I would 100% recommend the Royal Service, you're treated so much better when you have it. Also, if you tip well, and frequently, the service will be MUCH better.The service at the bars is excellent, however, service in the restaurants is definately lacking. The first night we went to the Italian restaurant, which took almost 2.5 hours to finally complete our meal. Unacceptable when all we ordered was an entree, no appetizers. The steakhouse was a little better, the French restaurant being the best of all of them. Apparently its pretty tough to get a reservation there, so make sure you book as soon as you get to the resort, ITS WORTH IT!!! The filet is one of the best I have EVER had, and the service was very good.The drinks would be better if they were made with fresh fruit, instead of slushee machine slush, however they were decent.The beds on the beach were amazing, but ignore the rules and reserve one early in the morning, or you'll never get one.Overall, it was an amazing experience, despite the few problems we had, which were resolved fairly quickly.I would recommend this resort to anyone!!Enjoy!

<Content>Overall...Ok We just came back with our 2 kids age 14 and 11. Overall we had a good time. THE GOOD:Great beach and great pool. Grounds were very pretty and kept clean. Plenty of food and drinks. All what you can expect from a all incluive. The kids were happy and kept busy at the pool bar and beach. The bad: We called in advance for a connecting room and we even had a confirmation. When we got there they informed us that it was impossible. We had to put our kids in a seprate room. The rooms were just ok but the bathrooms were disgusting. I never felt clean. I wish I would of brought my own soap. The soap didn't even smell. Thank god I brought my own shampoo! The towels and bathrobe didn't seem really clean. NOT a good feeling...Someone stole my husbands baseball hat from our room. We called the front desk and thery came to pretend to help. It was never found. They acted like we lost it and it was not true, the maid stole it...Overall it was ok for the price. Get the best deal you can and you will be happy.

<Content>Something for everyone After traveling to Mexico the last five years our family was ready to try something different. I research mostly through tripadvisor and the Royal Service feature of the Paradisius was very attractive to us. I will begin by saying the resort has many wonderful qualities. Our check out started at the wrong place. I thought after telling them we had royal service that we were at royal service check in but after completing all the paperwork found out royal service check in is in a completely different building. Once at the proper place, a very lovely VIP buiding, we sat down at a nice desk with champagne and air conditioning and did the check in all over again. We made dinner reservations and were then transported by a golf cart trolley to our rooms. We had two rooms as requested side by side. Our bellboy/butler was very informative and our rooms were spacious and clean. We found out during our stay our made Francescia our maid was wonderful! each day she spent time dusting, cleaning, washing the floors and anything else that needed to be done to make our rooms spotless. We were happy to have brought some fun school supplies for her 6(!) kids. The first night we ate at the Hibiscus buffet. Big mistake. the food was horrible!! If you have to eat there order the pasta. Its only thing edible. It did get better after that. We had reservations at the Japensese (great), French (good but you will leave hungry), Chinese (Great food horrible service), and Mexican (great), Italian (great and open until 3am), we had lunch once at the italian and a late night snack once also, the minetrone soup and eggplant parm is delicious. We had breakfast and most lunches in the Royal service Lounge. The breakfast was buffet but they will make omelets if you ask. The lunches were very good especially the chicken marsela. There are no sandwiches though so try another place if you want something on that idea. My biggest complaint though was the drink service at the Royal Service beach. The royal service beach is a bit of a farce. No one checks to see who goes in an out of the royal service beach or pool and people save chairs the night before. There is no drink service on that part of the beach. When I inquired they said there is and introduced me to the beach runner, he however stayed at the pool bar and we had to walk up almost everytime we wanted a drink. When I did complain at the royal service front desk, another guest overheard me and said she was served one drink on the beach the whole week she was there. I did notice the beachrunners on the other side working very hard. Someone from management needs to spend a few hours watching and correcting this situation. Any other resort we stayed at we had drink service and only had to tell them once what you wanted and they served us all day. The beach runners are only hurting themselves because we as many others were tipping consticently for service. This is the most expensive vacation we have taking which would have been fine had we been able to at least been served a drink on the beach.I would not return to the Paradisus until that and a few other customer service problems were solved. We traveled with our 1816 year olds who did meet plenty of other teens and had a ball. the shows are very good. The Las Vegas show and Michael Jackson Show were excellent. This is a big resort so you will need to take the trolleys. They ran regularly but when they didnot we walked and that was fine. It also rained for two days. We heard this was unusual for this time of year though. If you have reservations to travel here you will enjoy the wonderful beach and water!! Plan your dinners, stay away from the Hibicus restraunt and be prepared to walk up the beach bar for drinks!! You will enjoy it!!!

<Content>Nothing short of excellent!! Our trip the first week of Feb. was nothing short of excellent!! For those of you who like to take advantage of the all inclusive activites, this place had them all. We were most surprised and thrilled with the whole scuba diving experience, but we also did snorkeling, horseback riding , golf, and merengue dance lessons. Since we golfed 4 of the days we were there, we ran out of time to do the bike riding, the wall climbing, and the walk through the eco park (where I heard there were monkeys and macaws). Also there were kayaks, boogey boards, and windsurfing opportunities that we didn't get time for - all included in the hotel price. Plus there was a casino and a show each night.When we went to the scuba diving lessons, the instructor (Elie) was very patient with us beginners. In fact, I was scared to go out on the boat after our lessons in the pool, and he helped me through it by actually holding my arm the entire 30 minutes we were swimming along the bottom of the ocean. It was quite an experience, one I'll probably never have again, and I have Elie to thank for that! He is very compassionate as well as very good at what he does. If you are the adventurous type, make sure you take this opportunity.Golf was very nice as well. The course (Cocotal) is very pretty, and they really have an organized system of getting everybody out for their tee times. I would recommend golfing early in the morning, as the sun can get quite hot. We liked the first tee time (7:00 a.m.), and it was just enough time to get off the shuttle and get onto the links. Just a reminder, though, make sure you get a golf voucher from the hotel to turn in to the pro shop, or they will try to charge you for the all-inclusive golf! We did have to pay $35 per person for a power cart. The Benjamina course was, in my opinion, the prettiest nine of the three they had. And I was surprised that in 4 rounds we never got paired up with another couple from the states, always from Spain, or France, or Italy, or Canada. That was interesting and reminds us how golf is universal!The restaurants were all great (didn't get to try the French), and our favorite was the steakhouse. The least favorite was the Brazilian one, as you had to wait in between each meat selection, as they brought a big skewer to your table and sliced you some off. The cuts of meat were not quite like we are used to here in the states, but it was still good enough to try something different. The bar service was fun - we gave some new nicknames to the bartenders such as Smiley (Miguel) and The Whistler (Jose David). You will know why the nicknames after you come across these guys! Socrates and Raphael were also very good to us, and they all mix a fast drink. Try the lime punch with slices of lime in it - it has a name I don't remember, but they pour it in your glass with a soup ladle, and then add rum. It is very refreshing!! A good tip is to bring an insulated mug from home, as the drinks can get warm fast. We brought ours to the bar to get filled, then brought them to the beach with us.Our room was always clean, no bugs whatsoever, and the maid got us our extra things like more pillows and Diet Pepsi upon request. All in all I have no complaints and would highly recommend the Paradisus to anyone who wants to take advantage of all the activities and have some fun. If you are just going to lay on the beach and not participate in the included activities, you might be paying for more than its worth. My advice to you is to tan at home !

<Content>Overall Good, missed details Just returned from a stay a ppc with friends. Overall the resort was very nice. The food was good, not great, just good. The staff was good for the most part. The rooms were nice. The resort just has some work to do to smooth out the details to become really first class.Arrived late at punta cana by about 8 hours due to the ice storm on the east coast and the total incompetentcy of whomever runs Philadelphia Airport. (Easily the WORST airport in the nation)We were immediatly jumped on by the baggage handlers at punta cana airport. They are very aggressive. When we asked for a cab we were hussled to a cab that in hindsight was probably working with the baggage handler. The ride to PPC was done without the usage of headlights (very exciting) since the cab had some sort of mechanical problem. I suggest you call your resort and have them send a cab instead of using one of the cabs hanging around the airport.When we arrived at the resort there was some confusion because of the expedia booking system when you split one resevation for 4 people between two credit cards. Expedia puts all the tickets and rooms under the name of the first credit card. There we met a Bellman named Eddie Wilson ( a true shining bright spot of our trip) We were taken to our room and found it was not the jetted tub upgrade we had paid for. Eddie Wilson ( who speaks english, a rareity at PPC) got on the phone to the front desk and told them that we had to have an upgraded room. From what I could catch with my VERY LIMITED spanish the front desk wanted to put us in a room for the night and fix it tommorrow. Eddie insisted they fix the problem NOW. He stayed with us and 30 minutes and several phone calls later we had our upgraded room. Then while we unpacked Eddie Wilson went back to the front desk and got our keys changed. My wife tipped him $10 and from that point on he looked out for us and tried his best to take care of us.Here is where they started to miss the details necessary to become a true 5 star resort. We were unable to make golf starting times even though greens fees were included in our package because the guest relations desk had closed. We were unable to get a lock for our in room safe because they were out of them at the front desk. The next day my friend and I attempted to get a golf starting time at guest relations and we were told just to go out to the golf course because they always have cancelations. The course the resort includes in the golf package is a 15 minute ride from the resort. When we got there we were told the starting times were full. We tried to make starting times for the rest of the week and we had 2 choices 7:20 AM or 11:45 am. nothing in betweenso we scheduled some of each. We then returned to the resort and found that our wives had been unable to get beach towels because they ran out of them (another detail missed)The remainder of our stay was typical resort, eat too much, drink too much and play a lot of golf. You have to walk a lot from the residential area to the Lobby area, about 1/4 mile because they do not have enough shuttles running (anohter detail missed) so be prepared. The target groups for PPC is Euorpeans and Families not American Couples.We extended our room to 2 pm on get away day and had our fried Eddie Wilson pick us up get our cab to the airport. All smooth on the way out.If you go to PPC DO:Ask for Eddie WilsonGet up early to get a beach towelMake all your starting times for your stay ASAP with the golf courseEat lunch at the beach buffet at least onceLearn some Spanish before you go.DO NOTRely on guest relations, she (there is only one) is overwhelmedExpect the staff or the waitstaff to speak englishExpect to get a snack between 4 and 6 all food service shuts downGo near the casino, just burn your money its faster

<Content>Paradise ...Almost I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Paradisus Palma Real in Punta Cana. This is a beautiful resort. The facilities are modern, as this resort is less than one year old. That said, I was expecting more from it due to this fact. Two years prior I had stayed at the Paradisus Playa Conchal (Costa Rica). The older Costa Rican resort was better maintained. Our suite was equipped with a widescreen flatscreen TV, a Jacuzzi tub, and a king sized bed. Our stay started with an extremely humid musty room. We thought that by running our air conditioner that we would be able to dehumidify the room. It was disappointing to discover that the sheets, and eventually all our clothes took on a musty smell as well felt damp to the touch. I am not sure if this is a local condition, or isolated to the hotel. Our mirror in our bathroom looked like it had been scratched with something, as it had brown scrapes through it. Not something one would expect from such a high end resort this new. The jacuzzi tub obviously had an accident after installation. Our tub had already had a patch job done to it. The rooms are decorated with artwork, with frames with a fabric border. I'm not sure if it was a humidity issue, but there was the start of mold growth on the fabric. The room safe took 3 attempts from the hotel staff to get to work., The safe requires the room key to reset the combination. The facilities are incredible. The lobby, and pool area present incredible. We really had no complaints with the resort other than the annoyances from the room. The food in the restraunts was great. We sampled all of them. The room service food quality lacked consistency from order to order. Although, the food was tasty, I found that the exact same order tasted different on more than one occasion.The hotel staff were incredible. Service was top notch. Prepare to be pampered. Other members complained about smoking. We requested a non-smoking room. I sense that all rooms have the ability of being a non-smoking room or smoking room. It defeated the purpose of having a non-smoking room when the rooms on both sides of us had smokers. And, as mentioned earlier the smokers smoke everywhere here.

<Content>Incredible resort...miss it already! Before we left for Paradisus Punta Cana, I read so many reviews and was getting very worried about the negative reviews on cleanliness and overall experience.....but the experience was so amazing and I can't wait to go back! I realized that people's opinions are ALWAYS going to be different depending on their lifestyle, interests, age, etc.My boyfriend and I are in our late 20s. We enjoy posh hotels, trendy nightclubs and restaurants... and excellent service is very important! Because of our hectic schedules working in the nightclub business, we desperately wanted to go someone tropical where we could just RELAX and enjoy each other over the week of Valentines Day. Paradisus Punta Cana was the best choice by far! We also looked into the Paradisus Palma Real, which is beautiful and more modern, but we chose Paradisus Punta Cana because it seemed more intimate and authentic for DR. Immediately upon arrival, my breath was taken away by the beauty of the resort. The lobby area was so enchanting with open-aired rooms, comfy sitting areas, and gardens everywhere. We chose to upgrade to Royal Service upon arrival...great decision and well worth the cost!! The resort grounds are beautiful, clean and well-maintained. The trolley is a necessity to get around the resort but there are plenty of them and we never waited more than 5 mins. Even though the resort is huge, it was always very intimate and we never felt overcrowded by other guests. Our room was perfect, champagne upon arrival, was VERY clean (no musky smell at all!!) with a nice balcony, Jacuzzi bath and comfy bed. The pillow menu and scent menu included with royal service was a nice touch. And our butler, Nelson, was so helpful to make sure we enjoyed our stay. At our request, he prepared a rose petal Jacuzzi bath for us on two of the four nights we stayed....so romantic! Royal Service also includes use of an adult-only pool area. Loved the music!! The best part was the Bali beds everywhere. We never really had a problem finding an open one...and they're great for napping when you鈥檙e tired of being in the sun! The Royal Service beach area has a spa massage hut (with better massage prices that the spa offered) and was so relaxing with the sound of the ocean and breeze. We took a walk down the beach which showed us how great of a choice we had made...although many of the resorts are also beautiful, most of them had loud music and cheesy games going on the beach...not our style at all. (If I'm on vacation, the last thing I want is a guy on a megaphone trying to get me to limbo or play tug-o-war! LOL)Our favorite restaurant was the seafood restaurant at the beach, and we had fun at the Japanese restaurant. Our favorite bar was Gabi Bar at the beach...the bartender Juan was our favorite!! I wanted a mojito the first night but they didn't have any mint, so the next night he made sure he brought mint with him so that he had it ready for me! So nice! And make sure you try the mamajuana shots! ;)I could really go on and on about how much I loved this place....I would definitely recommend it to a friend (I already have!) and I can't wait to go back or check out other Paradisus resorts. One important tip: yes, everything is all-inclusive, but don't take it for granted! Bring plenty of cash for tipping! We tipped everywhere and always left a couple of dollars on the table even if we were at a buffet style restaurant. Believe me, they appreciate it! You'll see how the Dominicans live as your drive into the resort. Take care of them and they'll take good care of you!...Enjoy!

<Content>A perfect wedding at PPC My husband and I have just returned from our wedding and honeymoon at the Paradisus. After a trip last summer to DomRep to scope out resorts, I knew this was the place. The grounds are beautiful, and the laid out grounds ensure privacy but are close enough to ensure we often found our 30 friends and family that joined us. From the moment we arrived, we were treated very well--we had reserved a Royal Service room, which was beachfront. We particalurly enjoyed the VIP lounge, where we could check email and get snacks all day long, if we didn't want to go to a restaurant. PPC did a fantastic job of making our wedding special and beautiful. My only complaint are all of the unthoughtful tourists (all Americans, of course) who hovered around our wedding and were in the background of our pictures. One word of advice to travelers, have some respect and give private events the privacy they deserve. You have the whole beach to waddle your fat butts on. The drinks kept coming and even though the food menus were consistent, there was so much variety that everyone had a favorite. About 6 of the men that were in our party ended up with upset tummies---we suspect they were due to the excessive alcohol and lack of water than bad food. Most of us were fine and were eating the same food all week. All in all, it was a wonderful trip, a special thanks to our butler, Amaury, our VIP concierge, Nexci and our wedding coordinators, Jenny  Yadilis...you alll made our wedding week wonderful!!!

<Content>Great Staff, Great Guests and Great Tans Our stay at Paradisus Punta Cana puts the Dominican Republic at the top of our One Day I Wanna Live...My partner and I had a great time with everyone we met. A smile and an hola were all we needed. No matter what their position, frontline or support staff, eveyone was amiable without being phony.Our Junior-Suite room was pleasant. Plenty of space,and sensible lay-out. The design plan is heavy on wood and fabric. The effect is attractive, but without good cross-ventilation, the site is too humid for these materials. Keeping the room open and turning on the ceiling fan after the morning showers helped keep our room from smelling stuffy throughout the day.The dining options were fine. There were plenty of vegetarian options for my partner. Our favorite restaurant was Dolce Vita; both for the comprehensive menu and dining al fresco over a pond stocked with fish and a family of ducks. A close second was Sakura, the Japanese restaurant. It had a more exotic and mysterious atmosphere, but its only open for dinner.There were interesting activities planned for every hour that exercised the mind and/or body. The Activities crew were informative but never pushy. I learned to dance merengue and bachata, my partner practiced his tennis with other guests. Overall, we had a great first-time experience at Paradisus Punta Cana. Its perfect for long weekends. We plan on using it as the start of a longer trip around the Dominican Republic.

<Content>Non-Smokers Won't Be Happy My wife and I have stayed at several all-inclusive resorts in recent years and went to Paradisus, Punta Cana based on positive experiences at the Riu Bambu (Punta Cana) and Paradisus Playa Conchal (Costa Rica). Our overall experience was mixed and less than we hoped.Grounds are beautiful, room was fine (except a bit musty upon arrival), staff helpful and friendly. We enjoyed numerous included activities (e.g., horseback riding, golf, scuba diving). Our BIGGEST disappointment was cigarette  cigar smoke. We don't smoke and, aside from the Hibiscus buffet restaurant, no restaurant (not one of the 8 specialty restaurants) has a non-smoking area. We were constanly surrounded by smoke and it was most uncomfortable. Given that in Toronto where we live (and many other cities around the world) smoking is not allowed AT ALL in restaurants (and most bars) this is particularly annoying. We've generally been able to find smoke free areas in restaurants in other resorts but this was simply not possible at Paradisus, Punta Cana. If you don't smoke and smoke bothers you select another hotel until Sol Melia gets more progressive and accommodating. As an aside, several staff said it bothers them greatly too.The other comment is that the restaurants don't pay much attention to vegetables. In the French specialty restaurant appetizers and main courses were all meat. A tiny bit of pureed something beside a large steak was hardly a balanced meal. We ended up going to the buffet for salad before the meal. On the other hand, if you like lobster, you'll love the seafood restaurant. We liked the Japanese restaurant in large part because the seating was so close that nobody smoked.Hope this helps non-smokers avoid a bad experience.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Food, Great Parties!! We stayed at the Paradisus Hotel this past month. I have to say that the hotel was definitely a 5 star hotel. The food was amazing, the people and service were excellent,very friendly and the place was extremelly clean. I'm surprised to see all these reviews about people getting sick in general in Punta Cana. Bear in mind that these Hotels are all inclusive resorts that means all you can drink ...so yes, if you are boozing 24/7 you will get sick!!! This is common sense guys!The pool was great, huge pool! surrounded by trees which was great because you could stay in the shadow if you liked.The beach was amazing, never seen such blue acqua color anywhere else, and I have to say that we have traveled to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Mediterranean sea, and never seen such a clean and and beautifull beach. The best was the beach bar, Gabi Lounge, the beds on the beach, amazing place, relaxing great ambiance music. The bartenders were super friendly!We stayed near the beach and yes, we had to wait for a bus or hotel troly to take us to the lobby. The hotel is huge and some things are spread out. We figured that since we were vegging out all week, it wouldn't hurt to walk 5 minutes to the lobby as suppose as taking the bus. This didn't bother us so much as we like to be active even during our vacation. The water sports were great, all incleded in the Hotel package.definetly we'll go back to Punta Cana and definetly will stay at Hotel Paradisus.

<Content>Ehhhh... The resort was OK, but in my opinion not worth the money.Check-in was smooth. Room was ready at 3pm like promised. I went with a group of 50 for a wedding, and requested we be somewhat near each other which was not accomodated - we were spread out all over the resort. This place is huge...HUGE. The walk from the lobby to the main pathway itself is long. There is a tram to take you around, which comes whenever it wants. Make sure you have everything you need with you when heading to the beach or pool because it's a long way back. The pool was really nice and the beach/ocean was great - definite pluses. The food wasn't that great - repetitive, which is common at an all-inclusive but the choices overall were limited. The best meal was at the French restaurant, which was for the wedding reception - not sure if that made a difference. Drinks were very good. I didn't care for the service/attitude of a good portion of the workers - some were very nice, but others were unfriendly or a little aggressive, especially if I was without a male friend. Room was fine, had a nice little patio. My friends had the Royal Service and we still had a nicer room.I wouldn't recommend this resort. And I don't think I would go back to the Dominican Republic again (three in our group came home with scarlet fever). It was way too expensive for what you get. I'm sticking with Mexico, especially the Riu chain - food good, hotel nice, workers great, good price.

<Content>Great Bartenders Lousy Service Otherwise My wife and I decided to stay here because of our great experience we had in Costa Rica last year at a Paradisus property. What a mistake that was. We finally got two of our friends to join us on a vacation. We promised them it would be worth the money as well as to pay the extra money for the royal service. The hotel should have paid us to get the so called royal service. Upon arrival the check in process was very smooth and the lady was very pleasant in the concierge. After that the service went downhill fast and I mean very fast. Any time I needed something ex: tee time for golf, reservations for dinner, massgae for the girls it seemed like it was a hassle for them. Nobody smiled or greeted you with a hello. The only staff members that were great were Lizardo at the royal service pool and the bartenders in the front lobby bar. The food was good not great except for the seafood place(awful). The grounds were well kept, rooms were average(somewhat dirty), pool was nice and the so called private pool in royal service was nice. They allowed anybody in this so called private pool even if you did not pay for the upgrade. The beach was beautiful. Overall, I felt bad because my wife and I travel once a year and our friends do not. They still enjoyed it but the service levels were not what I promised them based on our great experience at another Paradisus. My suggestion is look elsewhere.

<Content>A Great Winter Holiday Spot - End of Jan 07 HEre is the skinny on a great spot:RECEPTION:We arrived at 1:00pm, were greated with an organized reception desk, they asked if we needed an extra bed for our 4 year old so we could have a King bed - we said yes. We then had a welcome drink and then proceeded to the buffet while we waited for our room. At 3:30pm, our room was ready, and we were taken via taxi to our room. 9/10BEACH:This has to be the best in Punta Cana, almost no sea weed. The waters were a bit rough the first few days, great for body surfing and the water was refreshing - not to cold, not to warm. The hotel had cool beds and huts all over the place, and Pedro was always getting drinks for everyone. 10/10FOOD:9 Restaurants, 2 needed reservations - Japanese and french. The MExican place and Italian place had great food, and the service at the Mexican place was great. The Grill had poor service and only seafood. The buffet was a bit boring as they did not vary the food a lot at break fast or lunch. On the Thursday and Friday night a number of the restaurancts were closed, and they did not post signs to that effect, so line ups were long - as the buffet was also closed - that was bad. 6/10ROOM:Room was clean, spacious and had fully stocked coolers. Water pressure was good, and TV had many channels. 9/10ACTIVITIES:There were all kinds of activities. As a Tennis player - they had 4 courts, and the pro there was good to hit with. They should have a sign up list so players can arrange their own matches. The shows in the evenings were exccellent. The kids club was good, only issue is that all the kids spoke spanish - so my little one had trouble socializing. 9/10RESORT:Spectacular, lots of forestation, natural ponds, walking areas. 10/10CUSTOMER SERVICE:Only issue we had and it was important is that no one gave me a message from back home regarding an illness in the family - that is very bad. Overall the service was fantastic, but that one issue is not good. 5/10Overall 8/10, would have been a 9 if not for the message.

<Content>The place to stay in Punta Cana My wife and I stayed at the Paradisus to celebrate our ten year aniversary this January and did we ever pick the right spot . This all inclusive resort is absolutely fabulous. The length's that the staff went to to make us feel welcome and comfortable were truely astep above the rest. The grounds of the resort are meticulously maintained. The beach and pool area are clean and well maintained. The food was great and we had a wide variety to choose from. I would return/recomend this resort to anyone .

<Content>OK The hotel is very old and i think it needs some upgrading, especially the safe in the room :) The bed linnen i actually hated, because it is never ironed and the housekeeper constantly put the pillow case inside out. The covers were dirty and so were the curtains in the room (they actually smelled). I have no idea when was the last time they washed them. The room is big though, which is nice, but something was always missing, like a towel. So i had to constantly ring the house-keeping do get what i needed and what should have been in the room in the frist place. There is a coffee machine in the room though, which is great :)The beach is the best feature of the hotel, its flawless. The only thing that really annoyed us were mini cars that they used do move around the hotel. It always smelled of diesel and made so much noise, day and night, which is extremelly irritating. You couldnt take a walk along the main road to reception without your feet, literally, turning BLACK...It's strange, because you would imagine it being a quiet place but there is traffic there, literally. Everything else in Paradisus was ok, I dont think its THAT good, Like i said it needs a renovation. I have seen 4 star hotels that were much better...Maybe i am just too picky, who knows. I hope everyone else will like it and enjoy their vacation more that we did. Good luck

<Content>HONEST review of the paradisius THE VIP SERVICE:we chose the vip service and thought it was well worth it. the breakfast in the vip lounge is far nicer than you will receive in the resort itself and is in walking distance to your room (you can take it to go if you wish too!) the pool area for members was gorgeous. nice swim up bar, friendly bartenders. also--cushy comfy huts to escape from the sun or to take a nap in which was really nice. beach area--a lot of room to breathe, crowding never an issue. the vip check-in/out also very quick, very accomodating. enclosed and had a/c full blast. the room was huge and also lovely. jaccuzi for two and they will bring champagne and draw a rose petal bath for you upon request at no extra charge.THE RESORT IN GENERAL:this place was enormous. a little too big for my taste, but still really nice. you can walk-- its sort of far, but with the sun beating on your back, its easier to take a tram car. they run about every 5 minutes and its an easy way to get around the resort... make dinner reservations the first day you get there. there are 7 restaurants some require reservations, some dont. figure that out the first day that you are there so you can hit the spots that appeal to you. for those who love to shop (as i do) you will be disappointed. we walked about a mile down the beach to a local market of stores and it was the usual junk you find...wood carvings, stone things, tee shirts, coral jewelery....was disapointed. and they dont come cheap. my fiancee actually is fluent in spanish and trying to bargain with the guy to buy a necklace and he told us he wouldnt go beneath 250.00 US....needless to say, we walked away! for the guys--there's a great (or from what my fiancee tells me) cigar selection at the hotel in the main lobby... he purchased a few dominicans along with some hand rolled, local cigar makers...he said they were excellent...also--there was this mini zoo...cute. you could feed the monkeys and it was a nice thing to do--you can walk in whenever and a guide will tour you through. only takes 15 minutes and it was a nice thing to do when walking around...EXCURSIONS:did the horseback ride on the beach...was beautiful once you got there, but they put you in this truck like cattle and its a 15 min drive through the dangerous streets of punta cana....a local police officer is awaiting your arrival to horseback ride. i live in city-suburbia in new jersey and i didnt feel comfortable in the town. the resort also discouraged its guests from leaving the resort. we love to snorkel and snorkeling was out of the question...nothing to look at...at all. also was told that there are a lot of sharks in the water from one of the bartenders...not sure...wasnt going to check either. we are beach bums, so we did not do any excursions besides the horseback ride...if you do want to do any excursions, the hotel is very accomodating.THE FOOD/DRINKS:eat breakfast. even if you dont ususally, eat it only because they do not open their restaurants until 12:30-1pm and its only the two buffets that are open until i think about 2pm and then they close until 6ish or so... im really not a buffet fan, so i wasnt super impressed...the dinners were pretty decent---good for all inclusive food...we were never hungry or let down... drinks--excellent...be sure to tip your bartender well and they'll make sure youre loaded up w. alcohol. if you smoke, they have marlboro reds and lights at all of the bars for the guests to smoke at request, free of charge. the mexican, french and japanese restaurants were our favorites...if we did it all again, we'd stick to only those three for the vacation!SPA:we each had a full body massage, and i had a pedicure/manicure...the full body massage was worth it...it really wasnt over priced in my opinion....the pedicure manicure was terribly overpriced for what you were getting....and i get them regularly at home for far cheaper and nicer! ladies, dont waste your time!! wasnt impressed at all. also did the massages on the beach..we both enjoyed them. but when they say full body---they DO mean FULL BODY! ladies--expect to have your pectorals massaged. it was not inappropriate, or unprofessional in any manner, but for US standards of a full body massage, it was very unexpected and something you DEFINATELY will not have happen to you at home... i take everything with a grain of salt and it was a woman massusse so i just laughed it off and learned that there are muscles under there that do get sore....OVERALL:we would never go back to the dominican only because there are prettier beaches elsewhere and i didnt like the unsafe feeling i got from punta cana....the staff was wonderful and the nicest people youd ever want to meet....the paradisius we would definately go back to if it were elsewhere.... the hotel was wonderful, we had a beautiful beautiful time but we wouldn't go back to punta cana because we like to be able to travel outside of our hotel....if you are okay with staying in the resort, definately go, you will be pampered w the vip service....

<Content>It's All About Luck Staying at the Paradisus Punta Cana takes some getting used to. After the thirty minute bus ride to the hotel, you are bombarded by hotel personal that want to tell you abou the offers when all you really want to do is unpack and go to the beach. The beach was beautiful, always clean. We came in on a Wednesday so the club was only about 30 percent full. As the week went on, the club became more crowded but also more fun. The food was terrible. Coming from a family of vegetarians, we didnt find much to eat that didnt include meat. The best resturant was the Brazilian themed one.The rooms were cleaned what seemed like 8 times a day, maids always in the room picking up towels or cleaning the bathroom. The shower, however, was very low pressure and often got cold after the first five minutes. One VERY important thing to note is the bugs. By the fifth day in Punta Cana I had about 100 bites from what the on-site doctor concluded was Sand Ants. Where these ants came from, I am not sure but I have a feeling they were from the beds. Either way, bring bug spray and calamine lotion with you because the stuff they sell in the gift shop is over-priced. The shows ranged from entertaining to laughable. One night they did songs from Broadway shows. Becasue many of the dancers do not speak English, it was hard for them to lip-sync but their dancing abilities were quite good. Take advantage of the Merange classes they teach on the beach because the staff members are very fun and later in the lobby you can show off your moves. Walk down either the left or right of the beach and you'll find a bunch of shops to bargain in...perfect for last minute holiday shopping.The club seems to close down at about 1 am. The Fun Pub was very slow at nights and my friend's camera got stolen while she was in there so I would not advise leaving your valuables un-attended. We also participated in the included horse-back riding excursion. This is not for the beginner. The staff at the ranch do not teach participants anything about riding horses but rather just give them a horse and tell them to start riding. Very scary for first time riders like myself.The people we met on the trip were awesome. They are probably the only reason I would see to return. If you have kids, make sure they either bring friends or are very outgoing so they can meet friends on their own because the club doesn't have many ways for teens to meet people.

<Content>Good place to stay but don't get pressured into buying a time share My husband and I bought into the Melia Vacation Club program 4 years ago when we first visited the Dominican Republic. We loved this resort as did our then teenage sons and the program was reasonable. We've since visited other Melia properties and have been disappointed in many of them. We have also tried every year to go to the property in Costa Rica only to be told that this one is generally impossible to get because Vacation Club Members who have this property as their home base use up the available time. In fact, we were told by the booking agents based in Miami that the Paradisus Playa Conchal shouldn't even be part of the program because it's so hard to get. This year, they tried to upgrade our program which is three times the price of our original one (33K vs. 10.8K). On the surface, it's interesting if you're an inexperienced traveler. We are not. We travel a great deal and have come to realize that the Melia properties vary from place to place and that they are not always the best ones to stay in. So, do not get pressured into buying into their program. Their sales people are very slick and try to make you feel positively stupid when you turn them down.We're fortunate that the Paradisus Punta Cana is our home base because this property is really the best one they have in our opinion. While the Paradisus Palma Real (about 15 minutes away) is brand new and very glitzy, we (and our sons) prefer the Paradisus Punta Cana. It's much friendlier with a warmer, more hospitable atmosphere.My big complaint, however, as a vacation club member is that they always try to find a way to extract additional funds -- like charging us $100 extra per person (mandatory) for their Christmas dinner which was far worse than their regular meals. They also don't treat vacation club members with the same deference as regular hotel or royal service guests because you have to work at the desk with the vacation club employees. They probably feel that since that you're a captive audience, they don't have to go out of their way for you or worry about you not coming back.If you're planning on going to this property, you'll have a wonderful time. Go as a regular guest and make sure you stay away from the timeshare salespeople. If they tell you it will only take an hour, beware -- you'll never be able to get away in under three hours.

<Content>Great Hotel! Great pool! I just got back from the paradisus punta cana with my family, and we really enjoyed our stay, and would have enjoyed it even more if not for a little error before we left: we were booked at the new paradisus palma real but they overbooked themselves and we had to go to the older paradisus punta cana. If not for the mindset that we could be at a better hotel right now, the trip would have been great, and it still was very good. Apparently, people got bumped out of the Paradisus Punta Cana also. Anyway, here is an overview of the hotel:POOL/BEACH: The pool was absoloutely fantastic...it wasnt heated but the air kept it warm all the time...it was very refreshing. All the cot's were seperated into little groups, so your family could have their own little private area, royal service or not. The bars were convineintly located also. There were also little huts all around the pool to give shade to whoever wanted it. The beach was also outstanding. The sand was unbelievable and the ocean was very nice. The waves were perfect for people to go boogy boarding or windsurfing! The one flaw about the beach was that it was very crowded, as it was filled with cot's, and didnt have its own little family areas like the pool.ROOMS: The rooms at the hotel were average...not great, just average. The beds are fine and the chez lounge was quite comfortable for relaxing. The TV got terrible reception and only 2 or 3 channels were in english. Not a good trip for TV watching. The mini bar in my room turned on and off by itself at times, so you never knew if you were going to get a warm drink or a cold drink. The airconditioner in my room leaked for the first couple of days and we could not control the temperature..there was a huge puddle in my hallway and my room was freezing all trip. Also, there is no door to the bathroom, just a shutter, so privacy is limited.RESTAURANTS/FOOD: The food was mostly good throughout the trip. The selection at breakfast and lunch was limited and the exact same thing every day. I got tired of having the same thing and ended up going to the 24 hour pizza place (also the italian restaurant) and getting pizza for lunch. There was a huge selection and huge variety for dinner. I thought the steak restaurant was by far the best! it had amazing sirloin and tenderloin. the buffet was the same every night but had some outstanding chicken wings. Also, the italian restaurant was great, especially the pasta and the pizza, (but dont over do it on the pizza or you will get tired of it). I didnt go to the chinese, french or seafood restaurant. The japanese restaurant was very nice, and the meat was very good. The give you a variety of sushi, which is not very good. The mexican and brazillian are also very good, and much higher than my expectations..they offer several kinds of meat for you to chose from and are pretty good. Overall, breakfast and lunch wasnt so great, but you made up for the empty stomach with an outstanding diner. Note also that the only two restaurants that require reservations are the japanesse and the french.RESORT FACILITIES: The resort was very nice, with tons of nature mixed in. There are ponds containing various wildlife, including flamingos, which were really cool. The resort is huge, and there is a tram that takes you were you want to go. When it passes your destination (i.e. your room) you just say gracias so the driver can hear you and he will stop for you. The tennis courts were clay, and pretty good, although very hot. You should reserve your courts around 5-6 at night, so it isnt as hot. The provide you with some tennis racquets and balls, although they are not very good.BAR: The bartenders were very good, fast and knew how to make everything you want. Every bar was amazing.SERVICE: We called for the hotel to service my air conditioner and mini bar several times, but nobody ever came. The check in was fast and the waiters were very good at the restaurants.

<Content>Open mind, open review O.K. just arrived from Paradisus and have been to Punta Cana as well as other resorts for the past 6 years. Once again, when you read reviews look sometimes between the lines and you'll find your objective reviewer.1. WIND, WIND, WIND. In any Punta Cana resort you must reside to the fact that there will be wind based on the location.2. People really try hard to be pleasant and accomodating.3. The Paradisus is HUGE, which in my opinion is a negative. To get from the beach to the main lobby, show area, gift shop, etc, you need to take there transportation service. (Kind of weird, for a place that is suppose to be so Environmental concerned the small trucks that are manual for transportation sure burn alot of diesel).4, Did not have our reservations at all. Could have been a break in communication from agent to Apple to hotel.5. Beach is definetly beautiful, water has waves and strong under tow.6. Shows are ok but not interactive like I've seen at the Iberostars.7. Forget to find an APPLE rep., non-exsistent. The lady from Signature was very helpful, I believe her name was Cathy or Cindy.8. Royal Service basically is Royal Pain in the butt. Besides your own litte eating area and some comfortable beds on the beach, they are basically useless.9. The hotel has some great activities but they are geared towards an older crowd. After the show and maybe 1 hour later, the place is dead, something for teenagers to consider.10. The rooms are your basic room at any resort. RS rooms are not any different.11. Didn't see any bugs, had a huge cockaroach in room, it would have been nice to open the sliding doors to get ocean breeze but no windows or doors have screens, so you don't know what might crawl in.Overall, its a nice hotel but with teenage kids I might look elsewhere. Honeymooners, couples who don't want to do much, this is the place for you. I would rate this hotel 3.5 out of 5.0. One more hint, when they tell you my friend, 5 to 10 minutes expect 15 to 25 minutes.

<Content>Paradise at Paradisus My family of four stayed in one room at the Paradisus. The grounds are beautiful. The swimming pool was enormous with a nice bar. The service here is second to none. We visited friends at a nearby resort and there was no comparison. The food was very good with lots of selection. They have security patroling 24 hours so I didn't worry about our teenagers. Our only complaint was the solicitation for attending time share meetings. The guys were standing at the entrance of the main restaurant. Once I complained to the management, the problem was dealt with immediately. Because the issue was addressed immediately, I would reccommend this resort without hesitation.A few things to keep in mind:Many of the guests are from different cultures, so there were several topless sunbathers. Many stores/excursions did not take credit cards... bring cash.

<Content>Almost a perfect place!! Our family of five adults just returned from the PPC and we had a wonderful time! We would rank it a 4+ star resort.The only negative things about the resort were:1. The front desk staff. Other than the young man who first checked us in, the rest of the staff were very unfriendly, slow, and spent more time talking to each other than serving the waiting people. The man who I returned our room keys, etc. to was just nasty! No excuse for such behavior either.2. There were no organized activities for teenagers and young adults. My kids are 20  24 and are used to a more fun and active atmosphere. Now obviously for some people this would not be a negative feature, but even we three older adults noticed a lack of a fun rapport between the staff and guests. This was especially obvious with the different bar staff, regardless of tips.3. It is very very spread out and can be confusing to get around. 4. The pathways are very slippery and the steps indoors are not clearly marked. An 80 year old man took a terrible fall as he was waiting to check in on stairs that should have been more visible.5. Access to the pool tables and air hockey. These are in a room that is often used for other things: karaoke, children's activities, etc. We all would have enjoyed many more games of pool had the tables been elsewhere.The positives far outweigh the negatives though!!!1. A la carte restaurants. Unbelievable choices and options. We ate dinners at the Italian (twice), French, Mexican (twice), Japanese, and Steakhouse restaurants. All but the steakhouse were exceptional! Others we spoke to had only good things to say about the Brazilian and Chinese restaurants as well. The best food we have ever had at a resort and we have travelled extensively. The decor of each restaurant was beautiful and distinctive, the waitstaff and hosts gracious and efficient.2. Alcohol options. We drank wonderful white wines, champagne, liqueurs, as well as beer and other mixed drinks.Presentation of food and drinks indoors was elegant and professional. Outside we brought our own insulated mugs that were filled without any problems. 3. The beach. My word, it was just perfect! White sand, no rocks or shells of any kind. A small amount of algae, but that is always the case. A steady surf that for us provided great fun for body surfing on boogie boards. Long stretch to walk for hours.4. Pedro the drink runner at the beach, Truly the sweetest young man who spoke not a word of english, yet managed to communicate brilliantly. Brought us drinks from the beach bar each day, and even a small table to put them on. He even pulled a beach bed down to the sunny area for us to lie on. 5. Access of beach chairs and beach beds. This was a very busy week but we always managed to get lots of chairs and the occasional beach bed without having to reserve them ahead of time!6. The pool. Clean and clear and refreshingly cool. A little noisy at times from the pool bar music, and the chairs there did need to be reserved early. The swim up bar was a nice option.7. Breakfast and lunch. The Hibiscus buffet was our choice each day for breakfast and had a huge variety of options to satisfy both North American and European guests. For lunch we ate either pizzas to go from the Italian restaurant (thin crust and very good), french fries and hot dogs from behind the pool bar, or a full buffet meal at the Caribbean grill next to the beach. It had a wonderful assortment and great pasta made to order!!8. Rooms. We had two in building 10, which was right next to the pool bar and within easy access of the beach and most of the restaurants. Neither had any stuffy smell or bugs of any kind!9. Maid service. Our maid was a sweetheart, she even gave us little gifts during the week! 10. The bellmen. Hector was a true gentleman and the rest of the men receiving the luggage and loading and unloading the many taxis and buses were friendly and fast. After my nasty experience with the checkout guy, thank goodness our last impression of the PPC was the bellmen wishing us a great trip and encouraging us to return!11. Raphael Silva transport service. I prebooked transportation to and from the PPC (two separate arrivals because my son arrived later) and the driver was there waiting each time promptly and with good quality vehicles.12. New Years Eve. From dinner, to the Christmas show, to the fireworks on the beach, it was a magical evening!!13. Shows. Most were wonderful, high energy and great!The Paradisus Punta Cana is a wonderful resort!

<Content>Fabulous beach and fabulous time! If you are looking for a perfect beach...great service and friendly, happy resort staff, Paradisus Punta Cana Resort is the place!We just returned from our first trip there, and had an absolute wonderful time! The resort staff was always friendly, singing and dancing around the resort....very happy people.We chose the Royal Service package, and would recommend that to everyone...we had our own butler at our disposal...a private pool with a swim up bar...private beach area, and private dining area. It was well worth the extra $$$.If you decide to make this trip, be sure to take lots of US Currency in $1's and $5's. The people of DR are very poor, and they depend on the tips that are given to them from the tourists....we took $150.00 in ones, and $100.00 in fives, and found that after 5 days, we should have brought more for tipping.....be generous....they will take very good care of you here.

<Content>So Fabulous...Will go back next year I stayed at The Paradisus Punta Cana Nov 30th, 2006 for 3 nights. It was not nearly long enough. The resort is so beautiful. The service is great, and the people are very accommodating. Yes, stay away from the time share people around the Hibiscus Buffet. Just say No Thank You, it is a high pressure sales pitch.The food was very good, especially El Marino (which by the way, has a different name in the daytime) There are so many restaurants, it was great to have variety. The resort is large, but easy to get around. They have shuttles if you do not feel like walking. The spa is awesome, get a massage!The rooms...are clean and comfortable. Yes they are a little moldy, but HELLO!!! you are in the Caribbean. It is wet and warm all the time. No big deal! Do bring bug spray, just in case. It is way too expensive at the hotel gift shop.The beach is by far the best I have seen in the Caribbean. Sandy white powder...and the ocean is so blue/green - it just sparkles.The nightlife is good, and there are several options. You never have to leave the resort....the town is not very big so you really have no reason to go anywhere. This place is paradise, wrapped up in flowers and a beach!

<Content>A wonderful trip! We traveled with a group of 5 couples and one has already written a review, so rather than repeat what she said, I wanted to mention a few more tips that I think you would find helpful. Towels: They give you a card that you exchange for a beach towel, the first day, they ran out of towels by 12:00 and guests were told to come back in 20 minutes. After finally getting towels on the second return, we learned to get towels on the way to breakfast in the morning to avoid this problem, and also to keep our towels for more than one day. We also traded dirty towels for clean towels at the end of the day rather than just turning in our towels and getting our card back. As long as you have your card by check out, you won't be charged the $15.00 per card charge.Food/Drink: The food was great, one tip we learned is that at the Italian restaurant, you can order pizzas to go. One day, our group ordered 6 pizzas and ate them on the beach. The coldest bottled beer and bottled water is at the lobby bar. Most bars have machines with frozen pina coladas and a drink called a paradisus (yummy). However, these are virgin drinks and you have to ask for them with rum if you would like alcohol added. When they add the rum, these drinks lose some of their thickness. A good alternative that they make from scratch is the banana mama. The Hibiscus, where they have a buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner closes in between meals. They are times when the only food that you can find has to be ordered thru room service (no charge, we just tipped the delivery person). The hamburgers at the pool snack bar are bad, would not recommend them! A few of us prefer Diet Coke over Diet Pepsi but thought they didn't have diet coke since nobody ever asked us which one when we orderd a diet soda. We later learned that they did have Diet coke, we just needed to order Coca Cola light!Weather: We had several spotty thunderstorms while there, many came up suddenly and were also gone quickly. There are umbrellas in the rooms, we didn't have one and managed to avoid getting rained on, but if you don't have one in your room and want to be prepared, think you could call and ask for one and take one with you in the late afternoon and evening.Transportation: The resort is large but easily walkable. We chose to walk most of the time rather than wait for the trams. Flip flops and sandals get slippery on the tiles and sidewalks surrounding the resort so be careful! Phone Calls: Research with your cell phone company before leaving how much it will cost to call the US and whether your phone will work. Some in our group did not have service. I had to get something added to my service plan in order to make international calls (it didn't cost extra). There is also an additional fee that is charged on the Dominican side and nobody could ever tell us how much that was. We won't know until we get our bill how much we really spent on two 10 minute phone calls. The easiest way to communicate with our kids back home was by using the computers in the lobby and sending emails. 60 minute ATT calling cards purchased in the US before leaving only had 6 minutes of calling time when calling from the DR. Special Occasion: We were celebrating my 40th bday and my husband arranged through guest services for our group to have champagne and birthday cake at El Romantico on the last night (again, no extra charge). They decorated our table, dimmed the lights and brought the cake out while singing Happy Birthday! It was VERY SPECIAL! We loved our trip and would definitely return to Paradise at the Paradisus!

<Content>Would go back in a heart beat! We just arrived back from what we'd say was one of our best vacations yet. We booked our whole trip online through American Airlines vacations in the summer. The package included airfare, lodging and transfer to and from the airport in Punta Cana. We were with 4 other couples. Our stay was from Dec 2 to Dec 7.TRAVEL: It went fairly smooth. It was a plus to have our passports. I would get to the airport at least 2 hours in advance of your departure time. When we arrived in Punta Cana the transport to Paradisus was great. Prieto tours took us to the resort. Raphel was our driver had he was so nice. He stopped and we had our 1st Presidente to start off our vacation.CHECK-IN: No problems. We did have to come back to get a safe key the next morning because they were all out of them. STAFF/SERVICE: Very friendly, nice and courteous. We brought about $100 in one's for tipping. We felt they all deserved it. They all work long days and work so hard. FOOD: We were happy with all the food and restaurants we ate at. We ate at the steakhouse, El Rodizo, El Romantico, Sakura and El Romantico. I'd say the filet at El Romantico was the best and that was on our last night. We ate all our breakfasts at Hibiscus. We loved sitting in the open air restaurants. We wished we could have eaten at El Marino. We heard the fried lobster was good there.BEACH: We spent the majority of our day laying on the beach. We all met up around 10 am and laid out. We took turns eating lunch and came back to our spots. All of us took turns making runs to the bar for drinks. We walked down to a market place that was approx 2 miles away. We were able to bargain a bit on the few souviners we bought. We also agree after viewing other resorts beach front we felt the Paradisus had the best beach front. Definately more upscale. Two of us had a beach massage and we both were very happy with it. It was SO relaxing. The lady that massaged me asked what areas I would like massaged. The breeze off the ocean and the sound of the waves were wonderful. POOL: Get towels early because they run out of them. The pool is beautiful and we spent a couple of days there for a few hours. We were by the swim-up bar. One afternoon we had a lot of fun hanging at the swim-up bar. A few mamajuana shots were had. It was a good time!EXCURSIONS: We went on the complimentary horseback riding. It was fun and we rode on a beach (not ours). They take a picture of you on the horse and then put the picture on a bottle of rum. They sell the bottle for $12. It was cute so we bought it. My husband and myself had our picture together. We did not take advantage of any other resort excursions. We basically relaxed. Two other couples in our group went on a jeep excursion and really enjoyed it. It was all day. FISHING: They guys went on a deep sea fishing trip and would recommend the charter company. It was Fishing Punta Cana. Their prices are online. Christian from the fishing charter was very helpful in the market place during our visit. He is very nice. The seas were very rough and the guys got a one fish but it was a large sailfish and they were celebraties when they arrived back at shore. Paradisus overall was beautiful and well maintained. I'd have to say I found our room a little musty but nothing I complained about. We loved walking around the resort and didn't mind a little excercise with all our eating and drinking. We did hop on the tram at times. The entainment was nothing to write home about but it was something to do and the performers were so nice and worked hard. We did use the internet in the lobby. It cost $5 for 30 mintues of Internet time. We were able to use our ATT calling card to dial home to talk to our kids. Just get the correct access code from the lobby to get to the ATT operator. Out of our group of 10 I think I was the one that got the most mosquito bites. I did use repelent in the evenings and still got several bites. I did not notice any mosquitos in our room and we had no bugs in our room. I think I covered most of our trip. We'd go back for sure and would highly recommend Paradisus. B. Kinder, St. Louis MO

<Content>The real review The reviews are right on target. When we arrived Saturday Nov 25th we took a taxi to the resort!!! If at all possible, try to find someone with driving skills, the driver was a mad man. (lol) Check-in was short and staff were very friendly. Arrived to room checked for the bugs 'per other reviews NONE. We were on the 1st floor and the window didn't lock so we called for maintenance and within 15 minutes they fixed it. Later that day we got locked out of our room... that on the other hand took 3 hours! That was frustrating. The remainder of the vacation was nice. Staff were friendly, a lot of english speaking tourists and they were friendly as well. Some of the resturants were not open and it was confusing because we didn't know which one of the 10 we could go to until that evening... I am sure that if we had called they would of told us... but we weren't in too much of a hurry. It rained a lot while we were their and the ocean was too windy, the red flag was up for the beach. We only went to the beach on a couple of days. Some flooding of the walkways but they have train trolley's that bring you around the resort. It is quite large. Entertainment was loud... like the reviews said.. also they were not very international in their entertainment while we were there. The entertainment was focused around USA. Would have liked a more international approach...I thought Hamaca Coral by Hilton's entertainment was much better. The rest of the resort is positive... our maid was fantastic.. she left little gifts or us everyday. Well... everything else is great, grounds are well kept, pool, and bar were great.

<Content>Best Resort/Beach Ever!!! We spent months browsing this site for reviews of Paradisus - not many were to be found. I cannot express enough how wonderful this place really is!! We upgraded to Royal Service for the sake of getting the free wedding. It was absolutely worth ever penny. SERVICE - Royal Service was fantastic. Especially Bibiana in the RS building. Luz - the towel service gal next to the private RS pool. Nelson, RS butler - our favorite staff by far - he is incredibly personable and goes out of his way to make you feel at home! Yadilis and Paula were our wedding coordinators - they were very very helpful and went above and beyond our expectations. We tipped approximately $400 in our week's stay - and I felt it was necessary every time!! The staff (especially the Royal Service) go out of their ways to make your stay comfortable. The maid service was wonderful - they left us little tokens/gifts daily. We tipped $3. for the am cleaners and $3 at night for the turn down service. I recommend the pillow menu as well - they scent your pillows in the evening - lavender was our favorite. We recommend to tip when you feel you've received service above and beyond your expectations...we ended up tipping a great deal!FOOD- We loved it!! I have a hard time finding any complaints about the food at all. With the Royal Service upgrade - you can take advantage of breakfast, tea time, snacks and evening appetizers in the RS building. El Romantico was by far our favorite restaurant - the Sirloin was perfect. The appetitizers were amazing! Our waiter - Nelson was comical and very courteous. We had our wedding cake set up at El Romanitco - VERY NICE and well done. The meals there are just simply amazing.Rodizio - Brazilian BBQ - fantastic but don't load up on salads and bread before the meat course - my goodness that's alot of food!! Sakura - Japenese Tepanyaki - it was very good! The entertainment portion of typical Tepanyaki was missing but the food was excellent!We also at the Chinese restaurant - good food but they don't quite understand when you tell them that you want SPICY. WEDDING - If anyone is looking for a place to go to get married - THIS IS THE PLACE!!! We communicated with the two wedding coordinators for 3 months prior to our arrival. Everything was clearly set up - we reviewed the plans with Yadilis the day after our arrival and firmed up plans. We took advantage of the free wedding services because of the Royal Service. This is where things went beyone my expecations!! We clearly noted that we did not want to exceed our budget - we wanted what was included only. I was asked to pick out whatever I wanted for a bouquet, cake, decorations etc. We were very surprised at what we received. A huge bouquet of Birds of Paradise, the most expensive beach set up, music, large cake and a carriage ride all at no additional cost to us. My two coordinators were fantastic!! They video taped and took pictures for us. The PHOTOGRAPHER is phenomenal...His name is Jerry. He is contracted with the resort. This man is very talented as a photographer!!! Please request him. He had our pictures printed and ready to travel home with us less than 36 hours after the ceremony. Tip these staff well - before the wedding ceremony!!!We had a private dinner on the beach the night before the wedding - incredible lobster!! We had reservations for El Romantico twice- once before the wedding then also the night of the wedding. And then we also received breakfast in bed the morning after our wedding. This resort really does a fantastic job with weddings. I'm very satisfied and feel that I received much more than what I told was the package deal.RESORT/BEACH - Nicest place on the Bavaro strip. We traveled up and down the beaches multiple miles in both directions. Paradisus has the nicest - cleanest beach of all that we had seen. They are very diligent at keeping garbage and sea weed off the beaches. We were discouraged by some of the other resorts appearances - many many times, we picked up garbage on their beaches and put it in garbage cans. Lots of styrofoam laying about at other resorts. Paradisus staff obviously take pride in the appearance of their work place. The private beach area for the Royal Service was so nice and clean - I spent a great deal of time on the beach - there was never a 'bad' day. The RS staff took drink and food orders frequently and delivered it to your lounging spot!!Socrates Trejada - bartender at the lobby bar - most entertaining bartender I've come across. He remembers who you are and remembers you drink preferences - try the Mamajuana at the lobby bar - that's the best mix!! And if you're so inclined to purchase a bottle of home made Mamajuana - talk to Socrates!!The grounds are beautiful- very tropical and green with splashes of color from different flora all over the place. They have a little zoo that you can tour - the monkeys (Bobby and Luna) are sweet as can be - the tour guide will let you feed them - they take the food right out of your hand!The room was beautiful - building 19 right on the beach. There was a damp smell to the room the whole stay but we had incense burners that cleared it up. The bathroom and jacuzzi tub are fantastic. Everything was very clean. The maid staff left us flowers every day - that attracked little ants but when we moved the flowers - the ants went away. The ants were only a problem by the flowers - on the sink. The beds are comfortable. The room is ...roomy. Plenty of closet space, drawer space and basic surface space. We enjoyed our terrace every day. EXCURSIONS - we had some problems with this area but it's not the fault of Paradisus. We were hooked up with VIP services for transfer to and from the airport and to arrange for our excursions. We signed up for an all day tour - Saona Island. We pre-paid and patiently waited for the bus to pick us up at 7:20am. At 8:15am when there was no bus - we got a bit anxious and tried to locate a VIP staff - to no avail. We ended up sulking in the lobby until the VIP staff finally showed up an hour later - and all they could say was, 'sorry, don't know what happend to the bus'. The trip was only offered one day that we were there and we were SOOOO looking forward to going - but didn't get the chance. We did get a refund but that doesn't make up for that loss. If you can use a different service other than VIP - I recommend it. We did book a trip for deep sea fishing - it was a nice boat and the guys tried to find fish but...no such luck. There was a bad storm that evening - so the fish may have been in hiding. We did however get some excitement from the bow riding dolphins for about 10 minutes. ACTIVITIES - there are alot of activities offered daily. We chose to spend most of our time sun worshiping on lounge couches. We did parasail one day - and that is well worth the money!!!! $85 for two people. We took our camera up with us and got several great aerial shots - what a beautiful beach and resort from the air!The mountains were picturesque. The water was so many shades of turqouise and blues....you have to try it to see for yourself!!You can be as busy or as lazy as you wish at Paradisus. You decide!! We cannot wait to return as soon as possible. After walking the beaches and seeing some of the sights in town - we have no desire to stay any where else but at Paradisus Punta Cana!!!I highly recommend this resort!!!!Our stay was November 15 - 22nd. It's considered off season at this time- well worth it to visit this time of year!!!

<Content>Wonderful Vacation We just got back from a wonderful 1st trip over Thanksgiving at the Paradisus Punta Cana. We stayed 4 nights. That is the minimum of nights I would suggest. The airport is very organized. Just follow everyone and you'll do just fine. Before we left home, we called the hotel and reserved a ride. After getting our luggage, we went to the Paradisus kiosk. They pointed to the curb, and there was our guy with our name sign in hand, along with a dozen other drivers. Nice air conditioned van and the drive took about 30 minutes. The driver did not speak much English but it was enough. We had a pocket Spanish guide and had fun trying to talk some. We had been a little worried about the language barrier since none of us spoke Spanish. Don't be concerned. The staff you have the most contact with all speak enough English to get you anything you want. If they don't understand, they get another staff member who does. Same thing with room service. The chamber maids however, did not speak English. But you can always call housekeeping and they would send what you need. You may want to pack a washcloth and hand towel. They give you 1 bath towel per person and 1 handtowel for the room. After 2 days, we learned to call housekeeping and did get 2 hand towels and washcloths. The next day, they came automatically. So if you call, you can get more room towels. With beach towels, you get 1. You can trade it in for a clean one. For us, it wasn't an issue. It was hot and we dried so fast, didn't seem to use the towel much. We had the Royal Service. Not necessary, but we wanted all the pampering we could get. We enjoyed it completely. With Royal Service, you get a room in a preferred location. We were in the first building by the beach and right next to the restaurants. You also get bath robes and slippers to use. The slippers you get to keep. The first night you find a bottle of champaigne on ice waiting for you and a basket of fruit. The second night we got a little shell candle. The third night some special soap.  It was very hot when we arrived. Most of the restaurants are open air. Lunch was very good at the Italian restaurant but I was pretty warm. The first evening we ordered room service for dinner.Excellent. The a/c is nice and cold in the rooms. We also ordered the bath prep available with Royal Service. What a treat. Your butler fills the bath, adds salts and oils, and puts flower petals on top of the bubbles. The bath is surrounded with candles and a stick of incense. Perfect end to our 1st day. The rest of the trip we were in bathing suits during the day. The temperature seemed perfect all of the time. Check out was hot again. So, dress cool. It makes a world of difference. Long pants and collars are required for dinner. However, I did see men in shorts and no collars enough times that I doubt if you would be refused service. The French and Grill House were excellent. The steak house had tough steaks. My complaint of the hotel is that in all of the guest rooms, the bathroom did not have a door. The sink area was open. Only swing doors to the toilet and tub. I like a door with latch. Everything else was great. The staff were all very nice and friendly. The beach and landscaping so beautiful. The bars are fully stocked. Had everything I could ask for (except for the bathroom door). Horseback riding was great. Long ride so whole trip took 4 hours. You must wear a helmet. We galloped a lot. I held on tight.It cost $55 a person which was a good deal. Bring sea sick pills if going on the ocean. Talked to some people that said 3 out of 4 got sick on the boat ride to go scuba diving. I would bring more money next time. Most vendors take cash only. There are atms, but I didn't want to pay the high interest rate.You can buy everything in US dollars. The staff do like tips and I think all of them are worth it. We truly did receive the royal treatment. What a disappointment coming back to reality. The Miami airport staff had a lot of cold, grumpy, unenthused people. Would like to see direct flights out of Orlando to Punta Cana. All of us so want to go back again. We have found our Paradise Island!

<Content>The Very Best Nine days over Thanksgiving week with my wife, son and daughter in law, 2 year old Grandson, and 12 year old niece. The two rooms with Royal Service were located right next to the Royal Service pool and beach, just perfect.We took advantage of everything that Paradisus Punta Cana has to offer, scuba, snorkeling trips, catamarans, horseback riding, the eco walk with monkeys and parrots for the baby (several times!).  When you combine Royal Service with this lush and beautiful resort, you have a vacation that you would have to work very hard at to be able to complain. The beach is magnificent with warm breakers to play with and miles to walk. The pools are dramatic with terrific bar service.  We dined at every restaurant and found the service first rate and the food good to excellent. The wine flows freely with excellent choices from Chile and Argentina that were pleasent surprises. Not all restaurants are open each night, so check the schedule so that you are not disappointed. Reserve at the Japaneese and Romantica, both exceptional. There is a little language barrier if you speak english only. This is an international hotel with guests from all over the world so the staff is not there just to please the english speaking Americans. They are dealing with several languages at a time. I noted one person getting frustrated trying to order a fancy martini in the chinese restaurant from the Spanish speaking waiter! Even in this case the staff eventually got it right and patience prevailed.On our last night my family surprised me with a 60th birthday at the Japaneese restaurant. They had baloons, candles  cake and made a big deal, even sending me little gifts from Royal Service to my room. Special thanks to Marianna, the Royal Service Manager.Just a note, we have cruised, owned our own Villa for several years, stayed at many very nice Hotels and this was the most enjoyable family vacation ever. We will be back!

<Content>A Welcome Return to Paradisus This was my second visit to Paradisus Punta Cana (same time last year) and my companion's first visit. I was not disappointed--the vacation was wonderful. Here's what I think you would like to know:Punta Cana Airport--be prepared to have your bags taken to your taxi once you get them off the belt, and expect to tip. They basically won't take no for an answer about taking your bags. However, they are efficient about getting you to your taxi. The taxi ride, if you haven't already pre-paid for a transfer, cost us $30 one way (same price no matter how many are in the cab, so you can save if there are more of you--up to 5 people).Ride to Resort--bumpy roads and an exciting ride--road rules are not adhered to here! However, these people are used to driving like race car drivers, so I guess you can expect that they know what they're doing. We had to close our eyes a few times. :-) The ride to Paradisus took about 30 minutes.The Lobby--beautifully appointed. Check-in was easy (make sure you have something that shows your reservation--I had a printout from my e-mail). Our room was ready when we got there (around 2:30, but we noticed that some people had to wait a few hours, so pack a bathing suit and sunscreen to enjoy the pool/beach when you get there).Language--the staff speak limited English. It is helpful to know a few words in Spanish and I think it is a nice gesture to these welcoming people to say hello, goodbye, thank you, etc in their language. Treat them well--I read that they only make $8.00 a day, and I know that they work 12 hour days, so be kind. A few Americans (especially East Coasters) were very rude to them. They don't deserve that, and remember, you are not in America. Be nice. Plus, they go out of their way to be kind and they respond well to kindness. We were treated like royalty because we respected each and every one of them.Room--a bit musty (it rains/showers a lot and the humidity is high). Nice size (suite), decent bathroom, nothing too fancy, though lots of marble. We had a standard garden-view suite. The soap/shampoo they provide is so-so. Perhaps the water is hard, making nothing lather very much. You might want to bring your own.Mosquitoes--at the end of the trip, I looked like I had the plague. The mosquitoes snuck bites in the evenings and while in our room (you know that eerie sound when they fly by your ear? I heard it most nights). Bring mosquito repellant.Pool/beach--beautiful and clean. Well-maintained pool, with a swim-up bar. Beach was very clean and there were plenty of available lounge chairs. Boogie boarding is loads of fun and the boards are free to use.Activities Staff--to me, these people are the heart and pulse of the resort. They are what made me want to return to this resort, and I wasn't disappointed. They remembered me and welcomed my boyfriend with open arms. They are very talented--they teach Latin dance lessons, they organize pool parties, they dance and perform in the shows each night (which, by the way, are top-notch for an island. We watched the shows every night and danced with the dancers/activities staff after the show every night). Say hi from Nathalie to Jose, Ambi, and Ricky--my favorites!Activities--make sure you check out the snorkeling and horseback riding. Both are loads of fun and included--take advantage of what you paid for, because I don't think this is included in any other resort in Punta Cana. You may want to bring a towel to make the saddle a bit more comfortable, and expect to get dirty--the horses are not clean and you will ride through some mud and ocean. My horse just loved the ocean and couldn't get deep enough! I thought it was funny and enjoyed it...go with the flow! I recommend wearing long pants and long socks--the stirrups will rub against your ankles and begin to chafe bare skin after awhile. Note: you will trot, and perhaps gallop, some of the time, so if you are faint at heart, skip the horseback riding. One teenage girl in our party squealed with fear every time the horse began to trot. sigh Snorkeling: they take you from the beach in a very small boat--you'll go through waves, so you will have an adventurous ride. Lots of fun! Snorkeling quality (number of fish, health of reef) was just so-so, but the boat driver brought bread, which we happily fed large schools of fish with.Food: Abundant, though mediocre and sometimes downright bad. Don't expect to please your palate. You won't. However, the restaurant that is good is El Romantico--you need to make reservations 2 days in advance. We had very good filet mignons there and the ambiance is lovely.Overall--this is a relaxing vacation, more than an adventure vacation. You basically stay in your resort the whole time, and there is enough to do, but you won't be zipping here and there all the time. To really enjoy it, take dance lessons (offered twice a day), go to the pool parties and nightly shows, and take advantage of the activities I described above. Or, just kick your shoes off and drink mamajuanas all day (you must try that drink--very good)!Note: expect to be approached by people trying to sell you timeshares, excursions offsite, etc--this is especially an issue near the Temple Gastronomique near the beach, in the alley between the pool and the Hibiscus restaurant. Walk around that area if you don't want to be pounced on again and again. However, a polite no thank you or I've already done it (a little lie works) while you are walking away will get them to leave you alone (at least for the day). Don't be belligerent--they're just doing their job.

<Content>Great Anniversary Trip ACTIVITIES: Scuba Diving was included which was a great treat for us as we were expecting to pay quite a bit to get in several dives. We thoroughly enjoyed the rock climbing wall as well. The horseback riding was fun but the helmets needed some cleaning. Take advantage of all the activities that the resort has to offer!STAFF: All of the staff was extremely friendly and willing to help. We did not sign up for Royal Service so we're not sure what we missed with that, but we thought that we received excellent service none the less. Bring a lot of one dollar bills for tipping.RESTAURANTS: El Romantico and the steakhouse were fantastic. The Japanese restaurant was very good but not as good as the other two. The Chinese was also very good. Our only complaint was that when we asked for decaf coffee we were brought a cup of water and a jar of decaf instant made coffee. We ate lunch at the Italian Restaurant a few times and got take out boxes at the buffett restaurants the other days to go eat on the beach.SUMMARY: We had an excellent relaxing time and will definitely be back with friends and family next time.

<Content>Great place to relax My wife and I went to Punta Cana for our 20th anniversary. We had a great time at the resort however the flight there and back had it's problems. We flew US Airways and had a terrible experiance. Our luggage was lost on the way down and we did not get it until the following day. We tried to buy some clothes to wear at the resort but did not find much of a selection. We were able to find some swimwear and sandals at a store on the beach. The resort itself is beutiful. November is a slow month as there were not many people there. Room: We were in room 2063. I recommend this room. King size bed, marble countertops, and very clean. The refridgerator kinda small but was stocked daily. We never met our maid Elsa, but she did a good job. We did leave her a few notes in spanish (the reort gives you a book of translated phrases). We did have some small ants in the bathroom when she would leave us flowers. The TV was small and reception was not very good. Cable went out the night before we left and was still out the next day. The toilet does not have enough power, enough said about that. Food: The food was OK. We ate at the buffet only at breakfast. It was mostly European style. You can have fresh omelettes made. Since we only there for 4 nights, we did not eat at every restraunt. The Japanese was good. the French was outstanding (try the filet, best I've had in quite awhile). Brazillian was OK. All the meet is served off a skewer. All the deserts that we tried looked good but did not taste that great. Room service was good. It took about 30 minutes to be delivered. All in all the food was good. It's a 3rd world country, and things are not going to taste like food in the states. Avoid the pizza. Something I was not aware of is that the resort serves top shelk liquor. I took Mr Daniles with me and didnt have to touch him The had Jack, Johnny Walker, Absolute, Bailey's and more. Beer was limited to Presidente which we liked. The pool bar was outstanding. Ask for Lenin. He took the time to teach us Spanish. Also, beware of the drink Mama Juana. It is quite potent.Speaking of the pool, it is quite big. If you have ever seen the pool at the Flamingo in Vegas, this will remind you of it.Do take $1 bills. This came in handy. I didnt go overboard tipping and i didnt notice a difference in service if I tipped or not.We both got massages, my first so I have nothing to compare it to. My wife has had several and she said it was good. i thought it was great.Both of us has some stomach problems. Pepto helped. It didnt ruin our trip.We went to Saona Island on a catamaran. The trip was all day. The island was beautiful. The food they served was good. The ride back to the resort was a suicide run. The driver must have been in a hurry. Drinks on the island will definitely help the ride home.All in all it was a very good trip and we will go back to Paradisus in the future.

<Content>Absolute paradise! What can we say other than this place is PARADISE! If you are looking to be pampered and be treated like a king or queen, this is the place to go.O.K. to start:AIRPORT: Typical carribean airport. Workers will flock to carry your bags. We didnt have to carry a thing as soon as we hit the airport. Of course be courteous  do not forget to TIP the workers. We paid for the transfers which were very well worth it. Took about a 35 minute ride. It was nice as you get to see the real towns  you quickly get the feeling of how life on this island really is. You will also note families of 4  5 on (1) ONE MOPED! HOTEL: We signed up for the Royal Service, it is well worth it. As soon as we got off the bus , again, we didnt have to lift a bag!. A cart quickly pulled up  drove us to the VIP Bldg for the qucik check in. We were greated with champagne and very couteous staff. From there on we were escorted by our personal butler whom gave us a tour of the property  drove us to our room. The property is huge  absolutely stunning!ROOMS: Very nice carribean feel. Very spacious kind of like a mini apt. Rooms were very clean. SERVICE: We met OCTAVIO by accident at the beach. He works in the ROYAL SERVICE and was working the beach that day. This guy is a gentleman,  a true blessing. We never had to ask for a drink as he would always take note  as soon as you thought you would have to get up  order, he was right there with another drink. He gave us all the info we needed about anything, including whether to leave the resort or where to go outside the resort, or where NOT to go. He made us feel very welcomed and comfortable. Another mention is the TOWEL GIRL (LUCY) whom sits in a little hut by the pool. She is there almost 10 hrs a day (thats how long we were at the pool). She is an absolute sweetheart and was very courteus  informative, so do not forget to TIP her. Not many people tip a towel girl , but it couldn't hurt to give a dollar here or there. All in all ,these people wait on you hand  foot and work so hard doing so. They really make you feel like a royal being pampered.POOL: We didnt use the main pool, but it was huge  very clean. There was alot more for kids at this pool. Also had a nice pool bar as well. The ROYAL SERVICE pool bar was exceptionally beautiful like something out of a movie! The bar is in the pool! They always had some type of euro/cafe type slow house music going. Drinks, came all day long! Also, Please don't forget to tip these people as well. These people work hard, real hard ,so a dollar and/or courteous thank you is well deserving. The have these beautiful huge beds that you just lay on underneath a hut. Then they have huge beds you can lay on in the sun. It's like an outdoor spa!BEACH: Clean  beautiful. The water is very rough making it harder to swim  or lounge in the ocean. You will note alot of topless sun bathers. You also have these beds on the beach as well.FOOD: You have a variety of restaurants. The best is EL Romantico - french. You must make a reservation 2 days in advance. then they have Italian, Chinese, Japonese, Brazillian, Mexican, Seafood. Food was good, although you do not have a varied selection of wine. The italian wine is Suave Bolla. So for you wine drinkers, you are pretty much limited. Again the service in all the restaurants is impecabble as well.ENTERTAINMENT: They have a different show a night. The bar in the main lobby is the happening bar. They have merengue, bachatta  various music being played by the band. Then at 11:30 the disco gets going then people tend to move over there. During the week, things do not go past 12:30- 1 a.m. the latest. we did venture off to an outside disco called MANGU's. Alot of locals go there as well as tourist's Its located next door at the other resort. Jump in a cab ($6.00  u r there). It's huge and they have 2 floors  the place gets packed. They say it is the most happening disco in the area. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WALK ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT! Pay the six bucks and you will gladly say it was the best 6 bucks you ever spent.TOWN: Yes, my beautiful wife really really wanted to but her mom TIN CUPS from DR (She's P.Rican). So my darling wife talks me into taking a cab into town so she can go to the boutique  get her mom's tin cups! Low  behold we didn't even get out of the cab  were already surrounded by groups of locals trying to make a dollar, tugging at us to bring us to their shops or their friends shop's. BOUTIQUES are non existent here  we quickly found that out! I did have to get change and we went to one bldg which is a Hotel, Bank, Bar,  appearent brothel all in one. My wife finally bought something  we quickly hurried back to the hotel. Bad move to go outside resort. Really is no need to go into town, especially for tin cups! We finally did get the cups as one lovely woman at the spa heard my wife telling the story  the next day she bought the cups one her own  brought them to my wife.This was the best vacation. It was a gift from my beautiful wife for my birthday. Despite hearing people talk about DR  me thinking I would get kidnapped or something, it was the absolute opposite. This is a beautiful place, although very poor  still a developing nation we are definetly going to be back here.Things to note: -T.V., You are in a developing country so remember the tv works when it wants. We brought a small dvd player which worked out real well as the tv was almost not working half the time. When you do get tv, most of it is broadcast in spanish. Internet: They have free internet for VIP members  computers in the main lobby that you pay for an access code. Try not to venture outside resort. Other than that , this place is beautiful! You will not be disappointed. Also please do not forget to tip. These people make $8.00 A DAY! If we can afford to go there a few bucks for great service is not much to ask. It just irked me that alot of people couldn't even be bothered to tip or extend a courteous thank you. -You know who you are. Have fun, enjoy  most of all RELAX as that is all you can do!Andrew  Cindy

<Content>Very Relaxing There are a lot of reviews already about this resort already, and most of them are accurate. We traveled as 2 families, including a 9-year old and a 10-year old. The week we travelled, the facility was less than half full, so keep that in mind as you read.Pluses:1. The food was better than expected - the only restaurant that we thought was below par was the Brazilian, where the meat was dry and not particularly tasty. The tenderloin in the steakhouse was very good. The Japanese restaurant was decent (make a reservation when you arrive), although not as much fun as a hibachi restaurant in the US. Breakfast and lunch buffets were very good.2. The resort is beautiful and immaculate. For a resort of this size, it is amazing that you see no garbage around and not a hair out of place.3. The pool is very nice - cool and refreshing, especially early in the day.4. The beach is beautiful, with a bar close by. 5. The lounge chairs were abundant and extremely comfortable. Because the resort was not busy, we were able to stay in an area that is normally Family Concierge, where they had waterproof beds that you could lie on instead of lounges. By the pool and on the beach, there was plenty of shade, from trees and constructed umbrellas.6. The kids enjoyed the Mini Club (Ceres does a great job in supervising the kids), especially the horseback riding excursion, which is done twice per week.7. Water aerobics at the pool each day was entertaining. It's great to see people do aerobics while holding a drink in one hand.8. The service was good, despite some language barriers.9. Drinks were generous, with some name brand liquors available. 10. The golf course was very nice, and only a short drive away. Reserve tee times immediately upon arrival, to ensure that you get to play.Minuses:1. Checking in can be trying. We were sent to Royal Service for some reason, then sent back because we did not sign up for it (by the way, I imagine that Royal Service is only worth the money if the property is busy - it was unnecessary for us, other than saving time at check-in). We then had to wait a couple of hours for a room, and had trouble getting an extra bed for my daughter. Also, at a time when the property was not busy, for some reason, they couldn't give us adjoining rooms.2. If you have any customer service issues, you will find that if you speak Spanish, you will get better, quicker responses. At the front desk, the staff will immediately turn away from your issue if a person speaking Spanish comes over to speak to them.3. In their enthusiasm to keep the grounds and beach immaculate, they have workers out at sunrise cleaning up, including using leaf blowers and chain saws! This can affect your ability to sleep beyond 7 or 7:30.4. Not much nightlife (not a problem for us). The casino is nice but very small, and they had a blackjack rule that is unfair - if you split or double down, and the dealer has blackjack, you lose the extra bet as well as the original bet. That seems like highway robbery.5. My daughter left a sweatshirt in the breakfast restaurant (I have no idea why she brought it in the first place). We could not get a great response from anyone in trying to find it, and were ultimately unsuccessful.6. Keep in mind one thing that we were not aware of until arrival, because of our own ignorance - the resort is on the Atlantic Ocean, not the Caribbean Sea, so the seas are rough. This may be a plus for those that like more action. My preference is the clear blue water of the Caribbean. Excursions are available to the Caribbean, but the all-day excursion involves a 1:20 bus ride. Some of our group members took the half day snorkeling excursion and had a great time.7. You should expect to not leave the premises during your time there, other than for excursions. There is a shopping area nearby, but the surroundings are not well developed (lots of poverty).Some have spoken about bugs - the only time we encountered them were at dusk (small gnats, only some of the days) and in the bathroom (yes, the harmless tiny ants that everyone talks about in earlier postings). No big deal at all.Overall, we had a great time, and would go there again, but probably not during high season when the service and restaurant availability would be more difficult.

<Content>Absolutely fabulous! My two children, 12 and 8, and I visited this hotel from 3rd through 7th November. It was just the most magical experience! Staff was wonderful. Helpful, courteous, pleasant, always smiling and gracious. The surroundings were fabulous. Great beach, with boogy boards and beach balls to use for free. The food was great! We ate at the mexican, french, and italian restaurants. My 12yr old daughter complained of a stomach ache on the last night we were there, but it was very mild, and a tablet of immodium took care of the issue!Breakfast: great buffet restaurant in the morning, perfect for a day at the beach. All inclusive was just that! Great pina coladas and try the paradisius drink! Overall impression: we stayed in a junior suite, close to the pool which was perfect: two double beds and enough space for the three of us. Clean, well stocked bar, and very pleasant staff. Ok, so the towels in the suite could have been softer, but what the hell! The pool was wonderful and we spent some time in it, playing volleyball, and when thirsty, getting drinks at the pool bar! The guests at the hotel were quiet and friendly. The hotel is very inviting for children, having an ecological part with monkees, parrots, turtles and iguans on the grounds. The check=in and check-=out staff were excellent. Service was great and we just loved the place!! Excellent value for money. We recommend the Outback Safari tour. We did this.. had Frankie as our guide and we had the best time! Each year we make a trip to the carribean for 4-6 days. We're experienced travellers and know what we want on a vacation. Clearly, this was the best hotel/resort experience. My kids loved it, and loved the staff. Now that we know what to expect, we'll be revisiting this magnificient hotel once a year! Thank you to all the employees we came into contact with, for making our experience so very special!

<Content>Very Nice Resort Just returned from a extended weekend stay at the Paradisus Punta Cana returning on October 30th. Overall I had a very positive experience at the resort with only a few minor issues. I've been to many Carribean resorts but this was only my second all-inclusive and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a fun place at a good price. This was apparently an off week because occupancy was low so some of my comments may not apply during busier weeks.The grounds of the hotel are very well kept and the pool and beach are gorgous. The pool is very large and extends off in branches in many directions so it is easy to find a quiet spot or be in the middle of the crowd. It only exceeds four feet in a few spots so this is a hanging out pool as opposed to a lap pool. Of course there is the swim up bar and plenty of lounges at the pool and beach. The one issue is that the lobby reception including the theatre, tennis courts and two of the twelve resturants is located in the front of the resort and is separated from the rest of the resort which is located closer to the beach. The total distance from the beach to the lobby is no more than a half a mile and they have a tram that runs continuously through the resort so it was a minor inconvinence. However, those rides on that open tram sure cooled you off on a hot day and they are fun to go zipping around on. We had a Junior Suite which I assumed would be a smaller room but it was actually quite large with a separated bedroom and sitting area as well as a small balcony (We were on the second floor of a two story unit). TV left a bit to be desired being rather old and static ridden reception. The A/C and fan left the room temp perfect throughout our visit. There was fridge with beverages provided in the room. Maid service was very good. I was happy with all of the meals during our stay. For dinner we eat in the Brazilian, Seafood and Italian resturants. We sat outside in a gazebo in the middle of a pond which was pretty cool our last night at the Italian resturant and although it was a hot night it was very comfortable. There were no waits for a table any of the nights we dined. The food wasn't the top standard you would find in a major city but it was quite good for where you were. My only complaint would be a desserts which looked good but didn't compare in taste. The hotel staff was great, very friendly and always willing to help. Even if their English was not so good they would do their best or get someone to help translate a phrase. The hotel maintains a small casino and spa which we visited and found to be again very nice with friendly staff. Be advised that the hotel's parent company runs a vacation club and you will be approached about a presentation in exchange for free gifts. We committed to a 60 minute presentation that we had to stop after over two hours and then they gave us a hard time about the gifts. My advice is to steer clear of these presentations unless you are seriously shopping for a vacation club.Overall this is a nice resort for the money. It is not the newest or largest but they have great grounds, facilities and staff. The twelve resturants create enough of a mix to keep you interested and it is a very fun place with plenty of activities.

<Author>zerocharisma1110
<Content>Pleasantly surprised! After spending several nights reading the positive and negative reviews for this resort, my boyfriend and I were not sure what to expect. We were grateful for the advice posted by other travelers, in particular, the notes to bring along:$100 in singles, insect repellent, bug spray, stomach relief meds, toys/school supplies to give as gifts to staff, Spanish-English translatorRECEPTION DESK SERVICES:The staff are very courteous and proficient in English. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 2:45pm (regular check-in is at 3:00pm) and we ended up waiting until 4pm. This was not a big deal though, because the staff were very apologetic and we enjoyed pina coladas at the lobby bar until our room was ready.Check-out ran smoothly. We traveled under Apple Vacations, so we did not need to worry about finding airport transportation to or from the resort.ROOM:We had a jacuzzi suite. The room was spacious and the jacuzzi was very nice. There were little ants crawling on the wall when we arrived and black specks in the tub (which we had anticipated based on Trip Advisor reviews). After going over the wall and doorway with bug spray and rinsing out the tub, both problems were solved for the duration of our stay. The doors are not insulated very well from the outside, so we put a small towel at the bottom of the door to keep bugs out and cold air in. We did not have any electrical problems with our room. HOUSEKEEPING:The maids did not speak English, but were very polite and reliable. We left them notes in Spanish for additional items (bottled water, hand towels) and they were quick to oblige. The room was pretty clean each day, but I've done better jobs in my bathroom at home. BARTENDERS  WAIT STAFF:The service is very good. Although we tipped whenever possible, we did not notice any differential treatment when we did not have cash on us.ROOM SERVICE:The service typically took 25 minutes or less. The chicken and fish dishes are very good.RESTAURANTS:The breakfast and lunch restaurants are decent. Nothing to write home about.There is a wide variety of dinner restaurants. I love seafood, but I have to say that a lot of the fish served at the resort was too fishy for me. The room service fish in mushroom sauce was the only dish that did not strike me was being overly fishy. My boyfriend really enjoyed the chicken and beef dishes available.We dined at La Dolce Vita twice because it was so good. The tiramisu is excellent.GROUNDS: The grounds are beautifully manicured. Our pictures do not do it justice. The guest areas by the beach are great. We never had any problems finding ourselves a nice shady spot under a palapa.POOLS: Hooray for the swim-up bar! I was a little paranoid of getting beetles and dead leaves in my hair, but they try their best to keep it clean for an open-air pool. ACTIVITIES:Horseback riding was included with our package, so we enjoyed a scenic ride along the beach. You should bring a towel to put over the saddle because your pants will get dirty from the saddle and sides of the horse. We also signed up for snorkeling, but we had to cancel due to weather conditions.The nightly shows aren't Broadway, but they were entertaining and the dancers are talented. After each show there is live music in the main lobby. One night the resort turned one of the lobbies into a nightclub and it was fun to drink and people watch. MISC:As many other travelers pointed out, Royal Service is not necessary for an enjoyable stay.I have the Spanish proficiency of a native 2-year-old (counting to 10, hola, gracias, etc.) but the language barrier was not really an issue. Just make sure that when you are making a reservation for a restaurant or activity that the day of the week and the calendar date are being translated correctly. We made a reservation for dinner at El Romantico for Friday night but were penned in for the date of Thursday night. (The restaurant was understanding and let us stay anyway.)I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing, romantic getaway.

<Content>Paradise found I am just returning from an extraordinary vacation at the Paradisus Punta Cana. I have staying at resorts all over the Caribbean and the world. The Paradisus has become my favorite because of the extraordinary and gracious staff.I picked the Paradisus because not only were the meals and drinks included as in most of the all-inclusive resorts, but also all of the activities including SCUBA, horseback riding and rock climbing. In fact, there are activities through out the day, such as aerobics, dance lessons, beach volleyball, and Spanish lessons to name a few, if you want to do more than sun tan and swim in the pool and ocean. The only expense is if you want to do a tour off the resort (such as an ATV tour or going to Catalina) or shopping (there are some marvelous small boutiques on the resort and other shops with in walking distance.The grounds are spectacular and well kept. It is an immense tropical garden with amusing statues placing through out the fauna. I came at the end of the wet/hurricane season but only one day was completely rained out. And umbrellas and covered transportation are provided to get out around as dry as possible for the quick showers that would interrupt the sun in the late afternoon. In any case, we needed to cool off from baking in the sun.Make all efforts to spend the extra dollars to stay in the Royal Service section of Paradisus. It is worth every cent. 鈥he staff is absolutely friendly and ready to do lend assistance in making your stay memorable. The concierges will get you checked in at their private lounge, arrange for your activities and dinner reservations and are very helpful in answering any questions you may have. When I decided to stay longer, Miguelina went out of her way to extend my reservation and willing to assist me in changing my airline reservation. Miguelina always had a smile and an amusing tale to share.鈥he butler service will have you absolutely spoiled. From helping with my bags, bringing us wine and candles, and driving us around to different places around the resort. But the best was the wonderful bubble baths that they would prepare with candles and flowers. Amaury, Nelson, and Alejandro are absolutely splendid!鈥oyal Service has their own air conditioned lounge which is a nice place to fo to relax. They also have high speed internet access there if you need to stay in touch with work or the outside world. 鈥here is a wonderful breakfast in the morning in the Royal Service lounge. The waiters, Felix and Jose, are cheerful and accommodating 鈥?keeping the coffee cups filled and will get you eggs and omelets made to order. Plus there is a happy hour with hors d'oeuvres in the afternoon. 鈥here is a beautiful private pool with a swim up bar, tiled lounges to lay back and drink your Pina Coladas in the cool water and frog fountains creating a relaxing environment as compared to the main pool. Plus a private bench area with cushioned loungers and the softest sand.鈥ou can make dinner reservations to any of the restaurants through Royal Service 鈥?for the other guests, only two of the restaurants accept reservations. This will keep you from standing in line.I spent my days horse back riding, SCUBA diving, and rock climbing, There is an activities center with a rock wall, archery range, bikes and plenty of games. I learned how to climb the wall 鈥?I felt quite safe attached to a rope with Jovanny being the belay. There is a SCUBA center on the beach with an experienced multi-lingual staff and two PADI dive instructors, Alex and Eli. Often dive briefings were done in English, Spanish, French and German. Since the dive center is on the beach, the boats are small but the dive sites - there are numerous dives on the coral reef plus a 40 year old ship wreck - are just minutes from the shore. They are also a PADI training center so you can get your certifications right there while you are on vacation. The Discover Diving course plus dives is included in the all-inclusive price. Get your reservations in early to SCUBA 鈥?it is a lot of fun. I brought my own equipment along and Willie took great care of it at the dive center. Just don鈥檛 forget to tip them.Speaking of gratuities, the all inclusive price states that gratuities are included. In my opinion, I believe people should be tipped extra for good service and rarely was the service shy of excellent. I quickly went through my extra tip money and gladly hit the ATM for more.I already miss the Paradisus and their remarkable staff. I hope to be their guest again in the near future.

<Content>Great Place to Stay My husband and I stayed at the PPC from 10/10 - 10/17/06. It was a great vacation. The place was gorgeous. The people were extremely nice and helpful. We do not speak Spanish and never had a problem. The room was great (no ants). The food was very good. They did close alot of restaurants every night, usually had 4 or 5 open. We didn't find this to be a problem, we were able to eat at a different one every night. All of them were good.The grounds, pool and beach were the best. They have plenty of places to lay out and relax. If you are looking for a place to relax, this is it. The resort was 1/2 empty which made it nice. We never had to wait for anything. They have a tram that takes you around the grounds and we never had to wait more then 2 minutes. They would take you right to your room or where ever you wanted to go.We took advantage of pretty much everything they had to offer. The snorkling, horseback riding, archery, batting cage, tennis, etc. They were all great. Don't let the people try to sell you an upgraded horseback ride. The one they offer for free is very nice.We took bug spray but never had to use it. We did do the ATV tour that they offered at the hotel (the one by the Hybiscus, not the one offered in the lobby). It was really great. We went out for over 3 hours. I would highly recommend it.The spa is very nice. We went there and used the hot tub which was great. We were the only ones in it. They have a nice gym and have spin classes every day.If you are looking for a fun nightlife....this may not be the place for you. They have a show every night at 10:15. We went to 2 and that was all we could handle, but there was literally nothing else to do. They have a Fun Pub which has 2 pool tables, air hockey and a DJ and dance floor with a bar. The only problem is they don't open it until 11:00 PM. So we went in there every night and 3 nights we were the only ones in there. We played pool every night and then went to bed (after we drank ourselves silly...LOL).Speaking of drinks...they have everything you could want. My husband had Stoli and Tonic all the time. I drank Presidente which was very good. They are very generous with the drinks.Overall it was a GREAT vacation. I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely go back. If anyone has any questions, you can email me at ginny_mae@hotmail.com.

<Content>Wonderful yet again Stay 5th October to 19th 2006Val and Darrell (British living in Switzerland)Just returned from our 4th wonderful holiday here. Its the best hotel in the Caribbean !. They have made a lot of changes in the last few years, all for the better. The staff are always happy and friendly, and the food and drink options are second to none. You can never get 100% perfection, but the Paradisus comes quite close.

<Content>Will not go back My husband, and our 2 friends stayed at PPC for 8 days, doing the Royal Service, which was a waste of $$. Don't do it!! The service is no better than what everyone else recieved-we have stayed at the Paradisus in Costa Rica, and that is RS!!!The resort itself is beautiful, but service is horrible-we had so many issues.The food was not great, which wears on you after a while. I would not go back, although the Dominican Republic itself is beautiful.

<Content>Great Hotel for the Dominican Republic I booked my trip to the Paradisus Punta Cana in March of 2006 and stayed at the hotel in early September. The websites I reviewed prior to booking my trip described the Paradisus very well and I was very excited when the time finally came. And I must say, overall, the hotel lived up to its expectation!1. Weather: It was perfect the entire time I was on the island. It didn't rain (not even once) and was not as hot as I expected. The temperature was very doable and I felt comfortable in normal island wear (shorts, skirts, tank tops and bathing suits of course). There were mosquitoes that got me the first day and I had big red bites all over my legs for the rest of the trip but they didn't really itch. I obviously would recommend that everyone bring bug spray.2. Rooms: The room was very nice. We didn't have any major problems with bugs - a few ants here and there but nothing major. Everything worked well and the room is nice and large. The bathroom probably needs a facelift but that was it.3. Hotel grounds: AMAZING but BIG. Literally, you have to take a tram to get around the hotel. We were lucky enough to get a room right by the pool area and found this to be a great location. Food, the pool, and the beach were all right there. We just had to take a tram to get to the lobby area. The grounds are perfection. There are cute little huts with benches for you to sit in along the walkways and I found it nice to just relax there after dinner.4. Food: I thought it was very good. I have been to all inclusives in Jamaica twice and traveled other parts of the world and would definitely rate the food at the Paradisus towards the top. However, remember that you are in the Dominican Republic not New York City and the quality isn't really comparable. The lunch buffet is amazing. All the lobster you want! I couldn't believe it! My boyfriend and I probably ate 5 lobsters each day at lunch. They were wonderful. My favorite place was the Italian food and the Japanese food. My boyfriend's were the Steak House and the Brazilian food. El Romanitico had a wonderful atmosphere and we went twice but I thought the food was better else where. 5. Service: They didn't speak English as well as I thought they would. Be prepared to spend some patient time explaining things if you have special requests. I thought the service could have been much better on the grounds / beach / pool area but the restaurants were very good,. 6. Excursions: We did take a day trip to another part of the island called Samara. We took a 10 person plane to the area (about a 40 minute trip) then a bus tour, a horse back riding trip to a mountain where we hiked to a waterfall, followed by some more horses, a very interested lunch of freshly butchered chickens (I had the rice), a boat trip to an island just off the coast, more buses and then a plane ride back. ALL of this for just about $250 a person. Very cheap for everything we got. It was from a company called Flying Tours. 7. Tipping: I tipped the people I thought I deserved it. Simple as that. The servers, bartenders, and room keepers all got money each day. I took $100 in ones and spent about $60 for two people for six days (if that helps you plan). I didn't think the service was better when you tipped or didn't tip - I just did it anyways.8. Advice: Don't forget sunscreen, your camera, bug spray or anything else you will need. The hotel charges a fortune for these times. If you walk down the beach (either direction) you will run into beachside tourist shops where items are priced very reasonably. The Dominican Republic is known for their unique Inca art if that's what you're into. Like I said, the previous two years I stayed at the Beaches Negril in Jamaica. To make a comparison, I would definitely choose Negril over the Dominican Republic. The hotel in Jamaica was smaller and more manageable, the service was outstanding, and food was excellent everywhere and the beach was nicer. With that said, I would still recommend the Paradisus for a place in the Dominican Republic. If that is the culture you want to experience the Paradisus is an excellent choice. Enjoy it - it goes by quick!

<Content>Paradisus severely lacking. Stayed at the paradisus for our honeymoon sept. 18-24. We arrived at the Paradisus around 4pm on the 18th and were greeted with a strawberry fruit drink while checking in, in the expansive, gorgeous open air lobby. Upon arrival to our room we found a beautiful arrangement of towel figures upon our bed along with Good night spelled out in flowers. Very nice touch.......until I went into the bathroom and found it infested with ants. I called the bellman back along with the representative that checked us in and was assured it would be taken care of while we went to get something to eat. Upon searching for somewhere to eat we discovered that the place was like a ghost town(not a bad thing) and that the only place to eat was at the italian restaurant. One restaurant open at 4:30 pm? Not exactly my idea of exclusive service and definitely not mentioned during booking or in the brochure. Having no choice, Italiian it was. The food I ordered was not the food I recieved and the pizza was less than acceptable. Upon further investigation I found out the resort was operating at less than 20% capacity. Returning to the room I was disappointed again to find that our insect infestation problem was not addressed. I called the front desk and was told someone would be out immediately. Within 5 minutes a hotel employee showed up with a can of bug spray and a rag and went to work. 5 minutes later he is finished and leaves. The bugs are still there and now the room smells like raid. I call the desk again and voice my displeasure and request a new room, which they take care of in about 30 minutes. No apology, no offer of upgrade, no sort of compensation. Whatever. This review could go on forever so I will condense. For the next 5 days the resort had a series of rolling blackouts which they would announce with a note under your door everyday. This meant no electricity in certain portions of the complex everyday. No electricity means, no blended drinks, no AC, no light to see during the buffet breakfast(which there is only one of everyday), no hot water, etc. I dont know if this is a way to save money when the resort is slow or what but definitely unacceptable at a supposed 5 star resort. Now on to my main complaint. The resort has a claimed ten restaurants open for dinner, with two of them requiring reservations. Every night, and I mean every single night of our stay, a minimum of four of the listed restaurants were closed, and two were actually just one place named twice. Each night there was no more than three choices of places to eat. The worst part was, you didn't know what was going to be closed until the day it was closed. We didn't get to eat at the Mexican restaurant(which we heard was outstanding) because it was only open two nights we were there and we had reservations at the other two restaurants those nights. What a major disappointment. False advertising aside, I feel as if I didn't get the exclusive all inclusive treatment that they advertise and that I paid for. Dont promise me something that I paid for and I expect to get and then not deliver because its the off season, or your not at full capacity. As far as the grounds, the beach, and the pool, absolutely beautiful. Walking to the shops, you may want to mentally prepare yourself for the abuse you will take from the local shop owners(aka vultures) that will swoop down upon you to practically drag you into their shops. Would I ever I go back to the Punta Cana, yes, would I ever go back to the Paradisus, definitely not.

<Content>Wonderful stay at Paradisus Punta Cana My boyfriend and I stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana from September 14th-18th. It was our first visit to Dominican Republic and our Travel Agent at Liberty Travel highly recommened this resort, with a great price for the Royal Service.Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by the staff and taken by golf cart to the Royal Service check-in: beautiful suite of offices, dining area and a large, comfortable lounge area. Brianna, our hostess, greeted us. While we checked in, we were offered libations and lavender-scented moistened hand towels to cool ourselves. From the beginning, we knew our stay was going to be special.Royal Service is more intimate with butler service and other special amenities (like scented pillows and aromatherapy oils for the room). Also with Royal Service, the dining area provides breakfast in the morning, tea in the afternoon and hors d'ourves in the early evening. Our butler, Amuya (sp?), is a very handsome man, friendly and professional. He played in the minor leagues in Michigan for the Detroit Tigers and he had the big shoulders for it *smile*. He always greeted us cheerfully and provided good service. The hotel was rather quiet when we stayed because it was after summer season and we LOVED it. The peace and quiet was perfect for us.The hotel itself is like a paradise. The grounds are well-kept and constantly maintained. There were of birds roaming, quite exotic. Our bunglow was right in front of the beach, perfect location. Anytime we ordered room service, it came promptly. It is my first stay at an all-inclusive and everything was free. I don't remember being charged for anything to eat or drink.The food was very good. I read some poor reviews and you'd think people eat at Le Circ 2000 everyday. The steakhouse, La Albufera, is lovely and the steaks were very good (much better than I thought). The Japanese restaurant, Sakura, was suprisingly good, even with a Dominican Hibachi chef- lots of fun! (reservations required). La Dolce Vita, Italian, was just okay, nothing special. Our last night at El Romantico was wonderful. The maitre'd, Mr. Florentino (I think is his name) was so professional and his stafff waited on us hand and foot. In fact, my boyfriend was allowed to get TWO main dishes because the first one didn't fill him up (Cod fish). There was no problem ordering what we wanted and you get full bottles of wine. Hybiscus is the buffet restaurnat where we had breakfast a couple of times. It was good, with alot of choices. The lobby bar is very nice and the bartender, Socrates, is the BEST- very friendly and funny! He hooked us with the best drinks, included the mamajuana- a MUST drink to try.The beach is beautiful and I like the cushioned lounge chairs. But it's the Royal Service pool and cabana area that takes the cake!!! Gorgeous, cool and intimate cabanas where you could sleep all day. The small pool with swim up bar was real classy. That area is worth the price of Royal Service alone.Since my boyfriend and I love to travel all over a place we visit, we took two excursions, one with the ATVs and the other to Saona Island. I'll write a review about those trips in the Things to Do in Punta Cana section. Please take the time to read.Last but not least, you don't need to change money...they LOVE the American dollar. DR is a poor country and people really depend on those tips because the salaries are so low. Take at least $100 in small bills, 50-60 in $1 bills and $5s and a couple of $10s. Those little tips mean alot. When shopping outside of the resort, always haggle and use the small bills to pay exactly what you agree on- if you give them more, they are reluctant to give back change. Don't give anyone a reason to charge you more than you want to pay.I would highly recommend Paradisus for mature couples and families/groups. There are alot of activies at the resort and the shows were fun and well-produced. There is a little casino inside the resort and a bigger casino right outside of the resort. Paradisus, as a whole, is a classly place.

<Content>Beach and Property are beautiful My boyfriend and I are 35 and 36. We stayed 9/17-24/06. Check in was fine, the room was kept clean except for the flowers which have ants in them, and the occupancy rate had to be less than 20%, which made for boring evenings and paying the Royal Service worthless since they let anyone do anything or go anywhere and there was no service on the beach for drinks, BIG disappointment for me. The breakfast at the Royal Service lounge had no variety and not any better than the buffety except the a/c. The fruits were not ripe and milk and juices were not cold.Because of the lack of people, many of the 10 restaurants were closed everyday, buffet did not open for dinner the whole time and closed for lunch several days. A lot of confusion when planning on where and what to wear to eat. Men are suppose to dress, but it was so hot that many of the restaurants relaxed the dress code and others didn't. My boyfriend was served spoiled meat twice, the lamb at the Albufero and the mystery meat at the Italian. This caused him to lose his appetite and eventually 6 lbs during his stay. Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, and Marino were fair. Beach party food was awful unless you like whole grilled fish which we didn't. El Romantico and Sakura made men dress, while all others did not. We heard that the El Romantico was good, but didn't eat there. Electric went out several times for several hours during our stay which caused the drinks to not be cold, the meats to spoil, and the inability to take a hot shower to be frustrating. The walk to the beach and pool from our room in Bldg#19 caused us to walk by the guys by the little shops at least 2-3 times a day and each time they would try to sell you the timeshares, jewelry, and ATV excursion which became a real nuissance after the 2nd day and repeatedly hearing, you guys just check-in? for 8 days!! Also, watch the ATV excursion price. We were told it was $85/person and I over heard him tell another couple in Spanish that it was $36???? We didn't go because of this. The Casino is cheesy and they switch up the rules on the Poker table at $5-15/bet. We heard a couple of people say that they had one $200-400 which is what we were hoping for to pay for an excursion or two, but no luck. Most of the people there pretend they cannot speak English, until you question the rules when they switch up the pay out on your win and then they can speak perfect English. The shows in the evening were okay. Gave you something to do to pass the time away. However, I didn't like that the property was so split up with the main lobby, etc. at one end and the majority of restaurants at the other. This spread the few people that were there out too much, so no nightlife, per se.The beach is beautiful and love the beds, the pool is nice but a little warm and the music at the pool bar too loud, but lunch there was decent and the people very friendly. The employee services were good. Royal service butler, Nelson Ortega, is AWESOME!! Miguel Perez cannot speak any English, but entertained me while I tried to practice a little of my Spanish. The Royal Service Lounge personnel were somewhat snobish and never offered a drink when I walked in the door like they always did when I stayed at the Riviera Maya Paradisus. Again, maybe the Royal Service is worth it when it is during their peak season...Overall, my vacation was nice because I went for the sun and sand, but although the property is beautiful and most of the employees are friendly, I will not plan to return because I didn't find anything exciting about staying in the Dominican Republic and heard everyone at the airport and on the plane complain of their stay and food at all the different resorts. Also, I will reconsider before booking during the off-season as it was too hot, there were no people, no service, and almost too boring, believe it or not! :) The drinks flowed and with alcohol, but the Presidente beer gave me major gastrointestinal problems and was only good when really cold which was hard to get. The Paradisus and Pina Colada mixes that they kept on hand were hardly ever frozen and were too sweet. I liked most of the tequila sunrises, and learned that I liked the white rums a little better than the dark rums, but still tasted of too much coconut for me. I'm not a big wine drinker, but did enjoy their Lazo Chardonnay. Finally, I enjoyed my stay much better at the Paradisus Riviera Maya in Mexico even though it wasn't quite as pretty when I stayed there over the July 4th Holiday a few years ago. You got private shuttle from the airport at no additional cost, beach service incuding snacks, no electricity shut offs, Royal treatment in and around the property, particularly at the private lounge, and oceanfront rooms. However, you did have to make dinner reservations everywhere except the buffet. After speaking with a couple, I won't give up on Paradisus properties just yet as I heard the San Juan property is nice.

<Content>Beautiful Beach We arrived in Paradisus on August 31st and left on September 5th. My husband and I are in our early 50's. We have been to several all inclusive resorts before, so we basically knew what to expect, plus, I had booked this trip 4 months earlier,  I had time to do alot of research. We did have the Royal Service and it is definitely worth it. I feel like we were treated with the utmost respect. We don't really speak much spanish, but we had no problems at all. By having the VIP service, anything that you may want or need is right there for you. Just call 1000 from your room and they will assist you in any way. Our reservations for dinner, golf, massages, parasailing and everything else was done for us. Our room was very nice and we never had to ask for anything. We did take alot of 1's ( 100) and I tipped everyone. I felt like they all deserved something. I also took lots of coloring books, crayons, and markers and left them in the room for our maid to use as she wished. She was very grateful and left us small gifts daily. The food was good. The beach was beautiful just like everyone else says. The drinks are excellent. Be sure and try the Coco Loco. Tastes like a pinacolda. We took a taxi to the Bavaro shopping center. You can walk. The taxi was only $5. This is where we did our shopping. The resort has shops but the prices are very expensive. We bought a painting for $50 at the Bavaro shopping center and the same painting at the resort was $350.00. Be sure and don't take the price they ask for anything. They want to sell you something, so just tell them what you will give them for it. Also, be sure and see the shows in the evening. The Dominican people are very talented and the shows are great!

<Content>Relax  My husband 38  I 35 stayed the week of Aug 27th and had a fantastic time! We choose the Royal Service (RS) and enjoyed the little extras. Tip for RS customers when you arrive at the resort there will be 2 pedestals, 1 for VIP the other for RS guests. Just find your name and point to it. A phone call will be made and you and your luggage are on your way to the Royal Service air conditioned check in. If you have not opted for the RS the bellman will send you to the lobby check in, unknown after that. After a quick check in (RS spoke English very well) your butler will give you a tour of the grounds on a golf cart and take you to your room with your luggage in tow. We were in bldg 19 with a beautiful ocean view room w/ wrap around porch. We had fresh fruit and a bottle of champagne waiting for us along with 2 bath robes. The room was very clean and did not have any odors. We did have the occasional little ant in the bathroom, but nothing to complain about or need bugspray for. We did not have a problem with water pressure or any electrical outages. We had a safe in the room and a remote for the TV and no complaints about the room. We left the maid $5/day and were left little token gifts daily. If we wanted water or beer or juice we just left a hand written note in Spanish for her and it was delivered by the 12 pack! For the food, we did not feel that being a RS patron got us any better service. Reason, all restaurants treated everyone the same as though they were the only ones there. Food was fine and neither of us got sick. Depending on the bartender the drinks could be strong. We didn't mind but if you do just ask and they will be happy to cut back on the alcohol. The RS pool and beach are beautiful and had plenty of chairs and beds. We did not reserve with a towel as others do and had no problem finding a space in the sun or shade. You can see the beach from the RS pool unlike the regular pool (which is very large and plenty of chairs but no view of the ocean). There was always parasailing or something going on at all times on the beach. The water was rough (not rough enough to stay out of) due to Ernesto as it is normally calm. Vendors never bothered us or did the time share people mentioned by other reviews. The shows were very entertaining and everyone could relate to the themes. Do bring bug repellant as it is a tropical enviornment and mosquitos are around whether this hotel or another. Check out works the same as check in, very smooth and quick for RS customers. We did not see many families with small children (under age of 15). Great trip and we will go back in the future.

<Content>Disappointed In May we stayed for a few days to make sure the hotel met our expectations before bringing 33 family members. The hotel was not a 5 star hotel but it was still very nice and the beach and water beautiful. The country is very poor and still catching up on American expectations. The hotel is nice and the people very kind. The service is slow and in some cases non-exisistant. It was not worth paying more for VIP service. During our May stay we verified a few items.1. Could we get a discount for excursions if we booked a large group? We were told yes by all parties but never received any discounts. In fact the 4 wheeler's actually stopped in the middle of the trip in the middle of the road and tried to collect MORE money. We paid for 2 videos and still haven't received them. AND four members of our party were seperated from the group and found themselves in the woods with machete carrying men! It was just workers coming home from cutting sugar cane. But needless to say the seperated elderly women in the group were not very happy. 2. We paid for all 33 people could we get the MAS points so we could use them for a free stay at another Sol Melia location. Again the answer in advance was YES but now that the trip is over we have been told. NO 3. We had problems with NO butler service at the VIP pool. Would there be someone available if we paid for the VIP rooms this was a big reason why we wanted VIP. We never saw anyone working on the beach. We had to stand in line at the bar for all our drinks. We had even given family members tip money so they would get good service but the service was non-existant. 4. If we booked a deep sea fishing trip could we get one boat? We were told we could get two large boats. The day of they told us we would be on 4 boats. When we reminded them we had requested two boats they told us they just had to take us to the boats in seperate shifts. When each of the groups arrived at the fishing boats we were seperated into 4 boats. 5. Could we book a bus to take us where we wanted to go? The answer was yes. We had a specific village we wanted to visit and we were told it was a 30 minute drive. When we got on the bus it took us to several places we did not want to go and it took 2 hours to get where we requested. We ended up missing other activities we had paid for. And of course we didn't get our money back.Our recommendation is DON'T take any excursions. The snorkel/scuba trip only had OLD childrens life jackets. The swells were so large we had two older family members that literally almost drowned. A younger family member had to help them to shore. The guide NEVER even noticed. The second dive one of the tanks was not traded out. If you are going to sit on the beach and enjoy the water and sun then go and enjoy it is BEAUTIFUL. but if you are used to and expect 5 star service and a YES to mean YES then chose some where else. (and watch your valuables. The staff at the airport stole items from our suitcases - remember the country is very poor and you won't know it is gone until you get home!).

<Content>Not bad, Not bad at all Well I must say my fiance and I were surprised. We had read all of the mixed reviews, and couldn't really get a handle on what to expect so we tried to keep an open mind. The facility was beautiful, and check in went quite smoothly. I do speak some Spanish, and some employees appreciated my attempts and some didn't, but no big deal. The grounds are well maintained, and we didn't have any problems with ants, power outages or anything. The food was so-so. We were there for my fiances' birthday, and they had a nice cake and champage with balloons and the like for him after dinner at the Japanese place. The nightly shows were very entertaining and well done. While we didn't take advantage of the extras that were offered, it was nice not to feel pressured to do so. Given we were there just before Ernesto started, and only for four days we had a nice time.

<Content>Absoutely Gorgeous! My husband and I travelled to Punta Cana in August to meet my sister and surprise her husband on his 50th birthday. I must admit that while planning this trip with my sister and she suggested going to the Dominican Republic and I was very hesitant at first because I knew nothing about the country. After some researching it sounded perfect. My husband and I have travelled to many places (especially in the Caribbean--I was a travel agent many years ago) and we both agreed that Punta Cana had the most beautiful beach that we had ever seen.. When our shuttle pulled up to the resort, we did feel like we had stepped into Fantasy Island...Everything was just beautiful! The resort was unbelieveable. We booked a regular garden view suite and were very pleased. The grounds throughout the resort were like paradise. The restaurants (except Japanese and Mexican) were clustered together but the landscaping was really well done. The French, Italian and Mexican restaurants were our favorite. The food at the Japanese restaurant was definitely not at all like back home--but still tasty! We were only there for 3 nights unfortunately, so we didn't get to sample all of them.  My husband and I walked to the downtown shopping area about 15 minutes away and were disappointed. The next day we took the 15-20 minute walk on the beach to the little huts set up and that is definitely the place to go! Must need to know how to bargain with the locals!I all ready have made plans for next summer to come back and bring our 2 daughters and renew our wedding vows for our 20th year anniversary. (We checked out the kid's club-even though our girls weren't with us)--Loads of things to do and keep them occupied.Would highly recommend this resort to anyone...the people were great and would do anything to help you! Be sure to bring loose dollar bills for tipping --even though we got great service the times we didn't have any money with us.Can't wait to go back!!!

<Content>A Beautiful Resort! I read many of the reviews before leaving and wasn't sure how we were going to like the resort because of the mixed reviews. My boyfriend and I were there for 7 days and had a great time. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The resort is very large but they have trolly-like cars that you can get on and they will take you anywhere you want to go inside the resort. The pool and the beach were beautiful and very clean. Service was never a problem. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Most, but not all, of the staff can understand and/or speak some English and they try very hard to accomodate you. Communication was not a significant problem. The rooms were very nice and very clean. Our only complaint about the room were the very small ants in the bathroom. I had read about them in a few reviews. They were not in any other part of the room but we constantly found them in the bathroom which we were not happy about. The food was good-not great, but better than we had expected. We would recommend Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, and the Steakhouse. The nightly shows were entertaining. The casino is very small but still quite fun. We also took advantage of many of the included activities with the package such as paddle boats, snorkeling, horseback riding, archery, batting cage, and the rock climb and we really enjoyed everything. It was a great vacation, very fun and relaxing. We would return again.

<Content>Beautiful, but poor service This is a real review from a real person (26 yrs)Punta Cana was overall a good getaway, but not the all inclusive you'd expect if you've ever been anywhere else. Beautiful landscaping and beach. I'm not picky with food, but the selection was lacking for the stars this place was rated. There were too many golf carts, motorcycles, scooters, and transports on the main walkways. We had to keep dodging them every 30 seconds. We lost power for a while 2 of 7 nights. The maids were kind as hell, but stayed in the local closet all day and never replaced soap, etc. They would take 5 dirty towels in the A.M and bring back 3 in the P.M. And to top it off, about half of the servers had attitudes when you couldnt speak Spanish (for real). I'm not asking a lot, but to have the bar tenders and waiters grunt at you on vacation is disturbing. I was even asked to show my bracelet at the swim-up bar! All of 10 people having a good time and this guys asks me to lift up my wrist, insulting. I should have demanded a refund, the nerve of this guy. When we ate at the Japanese place and sat with other guest, they ALL had similar complaints. Definitely not worth the price and not returning here ever. Trust me, much better service and quality in Mexico, etc.

<Content>not happy My husband and I and 2 other couples stayed at this all inclusive resort. We are all experienced travelers, and were not happy in our experience there. The rooms were not very clean. Upon arriving I had to request the bedding be changed. The white bed spread was very dirty. Isn't that something that is changed with every new guest? It looked like a tire ran across it. The tiny bugs in the bathroom set me off my rocker. I had no coffee maker, no robes, no iron, all as promised in the room discription. Our friends room had a broken lock, and could not leave the room until it was fixed. The waste of a half a day. Our other friends were moved completely across the compex because their air conditioner did not work. Then their television did not work. The staff spoke English only when we had money in our hands. The bank teller was down right rude, and had a very bad attitude. I am sorry I am a tourist in your country and you are working while I am enjoying myself. You wouldn't have a job if this were not the case stupid! She ignored us and told the person who let her know we were waiting to Let us wait. The bank opened at 9:00 and it was already 9:15. The food really was decent for an all inclusive, but any of the Reserveration Only restaurants were booked if you did not place your reservations the day you arrived. Fortunately our travel agent advised us of this and we did. The food and the drinks were pretty good. I am a very good cook (if I do say so myself) and a bit of a snob when it comes to restaurants. The steak at the steakhouse was fantastic, the lamb at El Romantico was great.The seaside buffet was incredible. So many choices, and very fresh.We all did, however, experience stomach problems towards the end of our trip. This did not even happen to any of us in Mexico. I don't think it was the food, I do think it was the water. Even though there is bottled water in the room, there is no sign saying not to even brush your teeth with it. It is four days since my return and I am still ill as are a few others. The only other thing I can add was that the excursions were very expensiveand limited to people in optimal health. One excursion that our friends went on was an hour and a half trip to a remote Dominican village. They were put on an unairconditioned bus, and then on a monster truck in 93 degree heat. No bathroom. (can be a problem). If there were airconditioning we would have gone. My husband is 52, asthmatic and I love him. I would not think of putting him through that as much as I wanted to go.Horseback riding on the beach was very nice, but again you had to book the day you arrived. Alot of research is needed before going to any of these places. We have been to many all inclusives. This was our worst experience, and was supposed to be a 5 star hotel. Are they putting all their effort and work into the new Paradisis?Better luck next year

<Content>Paradisus Punta Cana Recap We just returned from Paradisus Punta Cana from Aug 1 thru Aug 9, our experience was one of an interesting nature. I will say first off the hotel grounds were very nice, dated but well maintained. It seemed that every corner we turned someone in some way was maintaining the property, whether it be cleaning the walkways to painting the signs. Thank you to all previous posts as they were very helpful and I will probably mirror some comments.* Language barrier was challenging at times, some staff went well out of their way to assist others had very little interest in understanding (this was the minority). Dollar bills help in most cases. Front desk spoke English the best.* Food- was decent, Mexican, Chinese  Japanese among the favorites. Just keep in mind that you are not in the USA. For those concerned about the water, everything is bottled. Table water is from 5 gal and you still can ask for small bottles. You just need to ask for it. Ice is purified and bagged; we saw carts delivering the water daily to the restaurants and bars each morning.*Rooms- were dated, this is where we ran into our first  second issues, and we were traveling with another couple and learned quickly that the plumbing was so so. There was an issue with one of the facilities and when the front desk was called, we were told to place the used paper in the trash rather than to flush. In the public areas you will see this. Just the initial shock that the front desk made this comment left an uneasy feeling. Long story short. they did have maintenance check the facility and confirm all was in order. After several flushes (or attempts) still no major change. 2nd call was made, management was then involved which resulted in a 2nd service call to more men arrived rather quickly and told us that there was a problem and would be fixed that evening. To make matters worse the room was not acceptable on the cleanliness side; one of the beds had sand between the sheets. On day 2 better accommodations were made through the involvement of our travel agent and hotel management. Room issues went away for the remainder of the trip due to a room change. They did provide an iron / ironing board  Hair dryer in the room in addition to a safe at no charge.*Attire- For men, expect to wear casual pants each night (we saw people wearing jeans but not too many). Restaurants that were air-conditioned were, Japanese (reservation required), French (reservation required) and Mexican all others were open air dining. For women, capris were fine. Just no shorts for either. If you want a 鈥渟horts鈥?night, there is always the buffet or room service, which delivers 24 hours a day.Last but not least, the bar on the beach that we called the fish bar due to the mosaic of fish swimming was our favorite; the bartender at night (Omar) had a great personality and was a pleasure. PS Try the Mamajuana (local drink), Omar will tell you all about it. For those interested in smoking, they offer cigarettes at all bars including the swim up (Marlboro  Marlboro Lights). Cigars are free only at the French  Mexican restaurants, all you need to do is ask because there is a 鈥済uy鈥?by the main lobby bar that will try and sell them to you.Taxes, be prepared to pay usd 10 for each person in your party to enter the Dominican Republic. There were rumors floating around the resort that there was a usd 20 tax per person to leave. We did not pay this to leave, we did hear that it is illegal to tax twice and only people who ask are trying to pull a scam. Only other annoyance was by the Hibiscus, there was a row of shops which of course encouraged you to shop, but by then entrance was a guy pushing ATV tours and Solmelia employees were trying to sell time-shares.We hope this helps, enjoy your trip.

<Content>Wished we stayed longer We had the best trip water was great  sand beautiful lot's of huts to get out of sun. We arrived to a very friendly staff we upgraded to the royal service and really liked the personal attention. The pools were so great just like the photos. The grounds were so awsome everywhere we looked was beauty and so well kept. The massages on the beach were the best of ever had anywhere really recommend that. Our family travels many places never been to all-inclusive I must say this was excellent. Loved the different places to dine every night and staff once again lovely. The food was pretty good and we did not get sick we took pepto a week before we left and also there. The nightly shows were very enjoyable and thet always had dancing around the bar areas. The lighted disco dance party on beach was such fun my 15 year old had a great time as well. Once again the staff at these events got everyone hopping and so friendly. I can 't say how great the staff were to us. I really had a wonderful vacation. There is also a helicopter service to and from the airport if you choose not to drive. Wasn't to bad of a price for a added adventure to your resort. This resort does a wonderful job all around. Trying to go back in Dec with the rest of our family. Charlotte NC

<Content>Amazing Vacation We arrived to friendly staff and it only seemed to improve from there. Aura, Josh, and Maria DelaCruz were exceptional at providing personalized service for our entire stay. The staff were constantly grooming and cleaning the grounds. For the number of guests staying there, you felt like you were the only ones. Half way thru our week, we upgraded to Royal Service, and wished we had done that at the beginning. It was worth it for the services provided. Over all we had a great vacation there and would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>No Me Gusta Let me start off by saying that I have experience with all-inclusive hotels for over 10 years. My wife and I have only stayed at all-inclusives in the Islands, and we have been to Jamaica, Turks, Barbados, Bahamas etc. We are late 30's, and we brought a 15 year old with us.Pros. Beautifully landscaped grounds. Pool and beach area well kept.Cons. Everything else. Hablo y comprende espanol un pocito (I speak and understand a little spanish) but it does not seem to help when trying to get help from most of the staff. If they want to ignore you, they will wether you can speak spanish or not. And believe me, they will ignore your presence most of the time. At first we didn't think much of it, but after trying to flag down waiters, and trying to get drinks at the pool bar, and coffee in the morning etc. it became apparent that no one is being trained in customer service. And good luck trying to do any of the actvities that are included. Everything seemed to have been booked up 4-5 days in advance. A popular activity like snorkeling was only available for an additional cost of $270.00 for 3 of us. (I thought it was an all-inclusive)? Now I am far from being a snob that expects white glove service, but I resented the fact that we were ignored several times by hotel staff. Like the bank teller in the lobby that stood talking to her friend for 1/2 hour while we were waiting to get money. Like the waiters at the grill rest. for lunch, that never seemed to realize we needed drinks. Like the waiter in the Italian rest. that looked up to see my wife waving at him to place an order, and looking away as if she wasn't there. She waited an additional 5 minutes, and left without him ever attending to her. All in all was the worst vacation that we have ever been on, and by the way, I have never written a complaint letter before. I just had to in this case, because if it saves just one family from wasting their money on this hotel, I wish it could have been us.

<Content>Very solid place to stay The beach and the hotel garden is just beautiul. The rooms are very nice yet I would say some details could be improved. The personel is friendly and competent, but somtimes you have to have a little patients with them to get what you want. I would say that I would come back one day and with the experiance from this 7 day stay I would enjoy it even more, since the place is huge and you don't have time to explore everything let alone to enjoy all the activities hotel offers.

<Content>Very good time We spent a week at Paradisus and had a great time. As everyone says, the grounds are stunningly beautiful! There are so many people working all day long to keep everything looking gorgeous. The sand on the beach is so soft. The pool is wonderful and kept very clean. I would say the food was good - not excellent, but we are from a big city and used to many fine dining restaurants. You should MOST definitely arrange reservations as soon as you arrive. You should also try to arrange a time for the inclusive snorkeling trip ASAP. The available spots are claimed quickly and if it is too windy they cancel - that happened to us. I read one review that mentioned food poisoning. I have a hard time believing this was a genuine case of poisoning. Just because visitors get sick does not mean the food is poisoned. The locals eat and drink everyday without a problem. When your body is not accustomed to the bacterial elements native to an entirely different part of the world this causes digestive problems - it happens to me every time we travel anywhere in the Caribbean. Get a Cipro prescription from your family doctor before you go and start taking it at the first sign of trouble - you'll be fine. We tipped the staff and found it was very much appreciated. The average Dominican wage is only $120/month. Also, we recommend you make an attempt to speak Spanish whenever possible. It is also appreciated. All in all - we would definitely recommend Paradisus.

<Content>Loved It! Royal IS Service is the Way to Go! We just got back from Paradisus Punta Cana and we has an amazing time. We did upgrade to Royal Service and I would recommend that to anyone -the attention you receive is far beyond what you get with the regular rooms. Restaurant reservations are a must when you first arrive as they book up quickly. GENTLEMEN, PLEASE REMEMBER TO PACK LONG PANTS. This is a must for any of the restaurants for dinner. You WILL be turned away if you are not wearing long pants. Tipping is not expected nor required but is greatly appreciated from the staff and you do get a better level of service. The table water is ok to drink as it is bottled water. The food is delicious although the chinese and japanese restaurants were our favourite. Our 7 year old son went to the kids club and loved it. They took him horseback riding, rockwall climbing, feeding the animals (monkey, iguana, ducks, etc). He had a blast. The rooms are clean and well maintained. We loved it so much we are planning on returning next year and are looking into Vacation Club Membership.

<Content>Beautiful! We just returned from a week at Paradisus and our only complaint was that we weren't staying longer! The food was good, the room was fabulous, the beach was breathtaking, the water warm, the drinks plentiful and they even gave away free smokes at the bar! My only advice would be.... Yes, book your reservations for dinner early because they do go fast, so do the snorkeling tours and you need to reserve a spot for those as well. No, I do not recommend going to either of the Dolphin Parks, their acts of cruelty are well documented on the internet, just google Dolphin Park, animal cruelty, Punta Cana and prepare to be depressed. Yes, I would recommend tipping at the bar and meals because that is just what you are suppossed to do in a civilized country. No, don't go shopping on the beach unless you are well versed in the art of haggling with people that are extremely poor. And yes, drink the water on the tables at the restaurants because it is bottled and just fine. Have fun and try not to focus on your return flight!

<Content>Beware Paradise... My Fiance  I traveled to Punta Cana on April 12, 2006 to plan our destination wedding and stayed in the Riu Naiboa. It was a complete nightmare, the elevators were broken, it was crowded, the rooms smelled like dampness and the smell remained on your clothes afterwards; it was Horrible. So we decided to go back and look on 7/15-7/22, we dicided to stay in the Paradisus. Oh my god, as soon as you arrive you can feel the diference. The lobby is spacious and clean, and the fish ponds and gentle music playing make the whole ambience so serene. There are beautiful gardens and rare birds and plants. There's a shuttle that takes you from the lobby where the casino, the mexican restaurant, the japanese restaurant and the theater are located to the villas, they come often, but we chose to walk to enjoy nature. The staff is very pleasant and are willing to bend over backward to please. We tipped when we could, they work extremely long hours and don't get paid very much. The rooms are spacious, and clean...no musty smell. there's a balcony in every room, and there's couches a coffee maker and a fridge with soda and water, constantly stocked. There's room service. GREAT food. You have to make reservations in two of the 9 restaurants ( Romantico, and Sahara). We ate in eveyone of them except the chinese restaurant. The beach is wonderful, and beautiful. The water is not quite serene but it is wonderful. The pool is amazing too, i did the aqua aerobics each day at 12 and it was a blast! lots of fun.**HINT** when you do aerobics, if the instructor asks you what is his name, just say Jose, and You'll win a souvenier. Overall this hotel has something for everyone, beach parties for the young and shows for the older crowd, and cartoons and a mini zoo for kids. I loved it! So much so that i'll be getting married in this hotel next year!

<Content>Bring Pepto or Immodium The GOOD..no complaints wonderful resort, beautiful grounds..had a great time. Family group of over 30 were here to celebrat my brother's wedding...food was good not exceptional. Try the Mexican restaurant Antojitos in the main lobby..food and service was the best the entire trip. to bad we only found it the last night of our trip..staff was very friendly and helpfulThe BAD: as I mentioned this was a party of over 30 people. Almost every guest had food poisening that lasted over the 5 days we spent here...most of us have visited or lived in DR at one point in time..the trolleys.to slow, not enough of them..the lobby is just to far..over all, aside from food poisening had a wonderful time..the resort is gorgeous..

<Content>The good and the really bad. Having read the good andbad reviews, I went there with a open mind. This resort has some of the most beautiful grounds of any hotel I have EVER stayed at, and I do a lot of traveling. The restaurants, food and service (at the restaurant and bars) were outstanding, and I was never found hungry, or thirsty. The beach was beautiful,but not what I expected. I tend to like the calm clear waters, not the pounding surf of the Paradisus beach. I'm sure for many, this is not a problem, but I do a lot of snorkling and scuba, so this had very little to offer in that regard. You can take a free snorkling boat which leaves everyday at 10, 11 and 2 oclock, but good luck getting on. I stayed there for 10 days and was only able to get a reservation on the 8th day. Thank God I stayed longer than a week, or I would have never snorkeled at all. The only REALLY bad experience I had was with the excursion desk. They are located in the lobby, but have no real connection to the hotel at all. I booked the Dolphin excursion for my family (over $300.00) and was told to catch the 12:30 bus on the following day. We got there at 12:00 to make sure we didn't miss the bus. Well, at 1:00 no bus had arrived. I found the guy I booked it with and he told me that we missed the bus. Not only did I have a picture of the bus on the brochure, but I asked every driver that drove up if this was our bus, so I know we didn't miss it. Any way, the guy said that we can wait for the 2:30 bus. I told him that we may just want our money back. He pleaded with me to take the 2:30 bus, so I told him I would ask my family what they wanted to do. I was gone no more than 5 minutes, only to see our guy walking down the driveway to go home. There was know one there to return our money, so we waited for the 2:30 bus. The excursion was not worth the money. Wedid take the Saona Island trip which was great.

<Content>Loved it! We just got back from the Paradisus and had a wonderful time! The hotel is very nice and very clean! The beach is wide and long so you can take long walks or jogs. The food was good but really liked the seafood restaurant on the beach the best...try the lobster! Brush up on your Spanish because not all that work at the hotel speak English; I think Americans are in the minority. We found the hotel employees to be very nice for the most part. Bars are fun...try the mojitos...very tasty! It is true that you should bring lots of one dollar bills for tips...these people are quite poor and a few bucks means a lot...tip the housekeepers, bartenders; anyone that is helpful and nicel.The only annoying thing about the hotel is the people by the lobby who try to get you to hear a presentation about time share vacations and buying a 1 bd. or two bedroom... they are nice but very pushy and we sometimes felt like they were stalking us...watch out for them! The only other thing: two nights in a row we were awakened by screaming feral cats outside the doors who try to get into people's room service that is left outside...the hotel should suggest you leave it inside until the next morning....Oh yes...the beach is topless ladies..if you so choose.....so bring some strong sunscreen!!!!We would definitely like to come back here again......P  J

<Content>Outstanding Experience We were a family of 14 traveling to celebrate my dad's 80th birthday. I made all the plans and after reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous. WOW!! We were thrilled with the resort especially for the price. We all have travelled extensively and we agree this place is fantastic!! DEFINITELY do the royal service if just for the location of the rooms. We had 7 ocean front rooms in ocean front villas 19 and 25. All had jacuzzis. The check in was a breeze. All our dinner reservations were made in advance by email before we left because we had the royal service. The beach was gorgeous- as nice, if not nicer than Hawaii, Bermuda, Aruba, St. Lucia and Martin, Bahamas, Jamaica or Puerto Rico. The BEACH BEDS!!!! They were great. Better than any other resort we have been to. And you didnt have to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve one. There were plenty. The food was not oustanding but we all agreed we would rate it excellent. They really tried with extra touches. The French was great with string quartet with lovely service and food. The Mexican was also very, very good. The room was beautiful. We ate at the Marino seafood twice. The day we arrived and our last night. The last night they had the table set with flower petals all over the table. We had unlimited grilled lobsters and every appetizer on the menu. How could this be bad? The steak restaurant was good, the room was also beautiful but we enjoyed the others more. We were going to go to the Italian but the room was soooo hot with the open oven that we just ordered pizzas to the beach each afternoon for lunch. Tell them to make you a special seafood pizza(not on the menu) FANTASTIC! My only complaint is that some of the service is inconsistent. Turn down service some nights, they didnt replenish the rum we had asked for. The water pressure was weak and not always as hot as I like it. but you are in another country. I must say they did try to please and that makes the vacation very pleasant. If you take the royal service see Marianna-very helpful. Hope this helps!!

<Content>Most Beautiful Place I have ever stayed..... I have to admit that after reading some of the reviews I was little worried about our upcoming vacation at the Paradisus. I kept telling myself, everyone has a different opinion and go with the majority, but still in the back of my mind..... We just got back last night from our trip. We checked in on 6/27 and out on 7/4/06. Well, if you have a trip planned here, just throw your worries out the window, it was more than I ever imagined. From the minute you walk into the pond lined, living green lobby until you look out at the incredible blue ocean you are in Heaven. The grounds are beautiful, the staff very friendly, the pool and ocean like a picture post card! It is their off season so lots of chairs to find around the pool or beach, even if you don't roll out of your room until noon as we often did. The casino was small, but not as small as cruise ships, so bigger than I expected. We never left the resort. Just lounged around, met people, read books and enjoyed our little piece of the Paradisus. I have been on several cruises, traveled to Hawaii, Mexico, Bahamas, and numerous other places and this is the best of all. We did not do the Royal Service as we had 3 rooms we were paying for, but possibly if I was paying for just one room - it may be worth it, just hard to say without experiancing it. We were very happy with the average service. Only one time, late at night (3:00 a.m.), did we have trouble getting room service, but we did finally get through. The food was very good, but you are not going to please everyone. The good thing, if you don't like it, order something else, or go to another restaurant!!! Lots of food to chose from. We definately going back and soon.

<Content>Beach is reason enough to go My fiance and I had never been to the Dominican Republic or stayed at an all inclusive resort before so we didn't know what to expect. I spent hours on line researching before we decided on Paradisus and I can say that the resort definitely met our expectations. If you are a beach person, the beach is amazing, we spent very little time at the pool because the beach was so beautiful. I thought the food was fine but wouldn't describe it with quite as much enthusiasm as some of the other reviewers. El Romantico was the best for dinner. Breakfast was really good, to me the best meal of the day. My advice would be to make reservations at the reservation required restaurants when you first get there or else you may have a problem getting the night and times you prefer. I also would advise bringing small bills because it is hard to find change for bigger bills if you want to tip the staff in US dollars, that is. The service is exceptional considering how little money they make. We were surprised by what appeared to be a general lack of tipping by guests. The staff is so gracious and very appreciative of a tip. They will go out of their way for you if you do leave a tip. We weren't there long enough to do any excursions but my fiance did golf one day at the Cocatal Country Club and he had a good time.Like another reviewer noted however, I probably would have booked the Paradisus Palma Real since it is brand new but didn't notice it until after booking Paradisus Punta Cana. Either way, I am very satisfied with our experience.

<Content>Paradisus Rocks !!! I did alot of research prior to choosing this as a vacation spot and I was a little skeptical at first with some of the things I've read. Well...thank God I didn't feel the same way. The resort overall...was fantastic. Beautiful beach, great...not excellent...but great food, drinks were awesome and we couldn't ask for a friendly staff.I know VERY little spanish and my fiance knows none and we got by just fine. Our room was very clean and very spacious. The grounds were very well manicured - beautiful flowers and plants all around. The Beach was so wonderful that we didn't spend anytime in the pool. I'm very picky regarding food and always found something to eat on the menu that I really enjoyed. The best meal we had was the Italian restaurant...dont miss it. Had no problem getting reservations - but then again we did not go around spring break.I would highly recommend Paradisus....and if you can afford it, their new location is even 10x nicer (if you can believe that). We are planning on going again this winter and will return...but this time to the new Paradisus resort.

<Content>Paradisus was incredible We booked our trip several months ago, and by the time June came around, we had read SEVERAL negative reviews, and were very worried about our upcoming vacation. As soon as we drove through the front gate, we realized those reviews were just WRONG. Paradisus was absolutely incredible from start to finish. First, I鈥檒l say, use dominicantaxi[--] to book a shuttle from the airport to the resort. They鈥檙e just as cheap as the tour buses, and you get your own car, complete with driver waiting for you with your name on a sign, so no one else can take your car. At the hotel, there are trains waiting to take you to every corner of the property, and will even drop you at your door. After check-in, we went to the room, and were pleasantly surprised at how big it was, and it was immaculate. The maid had Hibiscus spread in the bathroom, and had already pulled back the sheets (a tip and some written instructions for the maid, especially for what you want in your mini-bar, goes a long way). Since we were honeymooning, they also brought champagne and fruit to our room one night during our stay. The towels in the room are huge, and they are more than willing to bring you whatever you desire. The shower pressure was a bit weak, but that was okay, a hard shower hurts when you鈥檙e sunburned anyway. The pool was huge. The water is warm, and the drinks are great at the swim-up bar, where they also give away free cigarettes and cigars. The towels were very easy to come by, and we never had a problem, as was a complaint in prior reviews. I鈥檝e been to Laguna, the Bahamas, South Padre, and Florida, and this was by far, the cleanest, whitest beach I鈥檝e ever seen. The resort cleans the beach of sea weed every single day, and you don鈥檛 see any, until late in the day, when the tide comes back in. In the water, you can literally see the sea floor, even in the deepest areas. White sands and turquoise water, it is exactly is it looks in the pictures, if not more so. Most of the water sports are included, like boogie boarding, catamarans, etc, but there are some that are extra. Get your scuba certification before you come down, and you can scuba dive for free. The food was absolutely fabulous. Sit down dinners like this in the States, easily will run you $100+ for 2, but here its all included. Make your reservation early for El Romantico, as it beats nearly any restaurant I鈥檝e ever been to, and I hate French food. Albufera also makes a wonderful steak. If you order a glass of wine in these places, they don鈥檛 bring you a glass, they bring you an ice bucket, and a new bottle of wine, uncork it, and leave it at your table. The greatest variety was at the Hibiscus, where it is buffet style for every meal (breakfast in fantastic). Room service will bring you ANYTHING from the restaurants at any time, you just have to know this going in, as there is a room service menu in the room that doesn鈥檛 look all that appetizing. While there we parasailed (extra $), rode horses, swam with the dolphins (extra $), played golf, got a massage on the beach (extra $), gambled, went to the shows, hung out at the bars, went through the eco walk, pretty much anything the hotel offered, and still feel like we need to go back, because of the things we missed.I鈥檓 convinced that the bad reviews are from those that are used to being waited on hand and foot. If you鈥檙e expecting that, this isn鈥檛 for you, but at the same time, if you ask for something, the employees will do EVERYTHING in their power to get it to you immediately. The service really is incredible, and its one of those places that you can leave knowing you got your money鈥檚 worth. Feel free to email me with any questions.

<Content>wonderful **much needed** vacation As a travel agent I feel compelled to write this review. I traveled with my husband, 10yr old daughter and my in-laws. We have traveled to the Mayan Riviera several times, we even stayed at the Paradisus there. We had our doubts that it could even compare. Well, no more doubts.....the Paradisus Punta Cana was wonderful. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The people who work here make it the paradise that it is. So friendly and helpful even with the language difference. If you try, they will go out of their way to work with you on what ever you need. They really do want you to try spanish!! The food and drinks were great and plentiful. If you worry about getting sick, bring pepto and immodium, but I bet you won't need it. THe beach is beyond words. We had so much fun body and boogie board surfing. The pool is huge and very clean. I have nothing negative to say, except the rooms do need a makeover. Nice and clean but do need to be madeover!THe Nature walk was great, we went over several times with fruit for the monkeys, Bobby and Luna and also for Maria the parrot. In Punta Cana the key is to stay in the better properties, 5 star or above. Our plane was delayed 33hrs and had to overnight at the Catalonia......:( terrible. Rooms dark, Pool dirty, music at pool bar WAY too loud, but they were having fun. The beach was grouse. flat water no waves, lots of sea grass. The staff unfriendly, drinks lousy and food ok. So, this is a 4star according to the tour operator, but the Catalonia gives itself a 5 star and it in NOWAY compared to the Paradius. So pay more and come home happy.......... Paradise is at the Paradisus! We will go back!

<Content>don't believe all you read.. I tell you what.. I had planned this trip since January, when I started reading the reviews, I sincerely thought that I was not going to like what I found, but to much amazement I was surprised to find out everything the bad reviews said was not true... Our family usually goes to a different country every year; I've been to Europe, the Caribbean and South America as well as the states and WE TRULY ENJOYED THIS RESORT VERY MUCH.. THE FOOD WAS GREAT, the only thing the French (El Romantico) does not serve very much, I found it average.. Everything else was great... THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, all the waiters in special Carlos at the Palapa was one of the best one's, the bartenders and everyone else throughout the hotel was amazing.. the only thing I did not like was that the pool closed at 6:00 pm. I wished it could stay open at least until 8:00 but the reason they do this is to clean it.. I did find this resort to be a family and couples oriented.. I did find taking $1 bills worked out good.. as it is true that the average waiter gets paid only $100 bi-weekly and they work 12 hour shifts so we usually tipped a little more if we saw them working lunch and dinner.. the rooms we found were average nothing out of the norm of course we did not upgrade to royal service but I truly felt we were treated equally anyway.. the activities and the shows are very good.. the only thing I did have a complaint about was transportation you have to travel in little trolleys and they are not all mechanically kept so sometimes they were kind of short because some were broken down.. but you still got around.. Enjoy your vacation this resort is well worth every penny you spend..

<Content>Beautiful and relaxing I am a working mother who has recently returned from a trip to paradise. I have traveled often but mostly with the kids and my all inclusive expieriences were limited to cruises. I went with a friend and our purpose was escape and relaxation, on the guilt ridden mommy left the kids at home with dad budget.That in mind the Paradisus couldnt have been more perfect. EnvironmentThe grounds are beautifull, I recomend taking the time to explore the grounds and all the facilities the loby area is open air and wonderfully decorated the grounds are perfectly kept and there are wonders in every corner, Go to the paradise walk a small zoo like area where your guide intoduces you to there birds of paradise, turtles, iguanas and monkeys. At this location I was given a book on the flora on the grounds I recomend getting it and Identifiing all the gorgeouse flowering trees. The beach is breathtaking with flowering plants right up to the sand and beds yes beds sun and shade at your disposal. The beach was never crowded and there was always a bed available. I think some of the previous reviewers were either blind or at a different resort because there were several beach bars one large permanent one and two smaller set up bars accomadating beach guests. There were also prompt and curtious beach runners bringing drinks and anything from the room service menus. The pool was beautifull never crowded. The suite was nice clean and spaciouse we had a Jacusi suite on the beach. Apparently all there rooms are juniorsuites,unless you get the one garden bungalo or one of only four ambassador suites. All inclusive/foodThe food was great such a huge variety with 11 different resturants that in our 5 day stay we were unable to try them all. Yes only three are open durring the day the others for dinner only. However the ones open had chefs sitting there awaiting to make you food however you wanted it in Hibiscus there was an omlete cheff and a meat cheff who took raw chicken, pork, beef or eggs,and made it any way you wanted with a varity of spices and accompanyments. The palapa grill always had hamburgers hotdogs or chicken sandwichs made to order fresh food not fast. Why that would be ordered with the huge variety of buffet items I have no idea but it was certainly available. Any and all drinks were available and free and so were cigaretes and cigars! at the bars which I did try (dont tell my kids. Room service menu was a bit weak but all resturants would box up anything for you. The entertainment was very fun even though it was cheesy at times. The beach parties and welcome parties were very fun and entertaining as were the vegas type shows. Scuba if your precertified and snorkling is included as well as a couple of boat excurrsions and of course lots of dance and exercise classes. This information is not readily available so go to the club house (red)which is on the beach and aquatics house (blue)to get info and sign up as soon as you get there.Take advantage of the bicycling,horseback riding and the free spa as well. There are some spa services at extra charge and excursions at extra charge from what I heard the excursions were not worth the additional charges and I wouldnt bother with so much already included. There are three shopping centers within walking distance dont bother with a taxi. Dont pay the price they ask at those centers either in fact pay less than a third and you may still be paying too much. The first store I went too asked for $150 us dollars for the same necklace I bought at a store two doors down for 12 bucks.Service We did get the royal service were very disapionted and would not recomend it. It was not at all worth another $150 a night as I met others at the resort who did not have it and had prompter service. The waiters bartenders and tram drivers were all very friendly and helpfull, The royal service receptionists and butler were not at all. In fact they seamed a bit purposefully rude and ignorant they differed all questions back to the main loby anyway. . Just dont do it.On a final note bring plenty of bug spray. If you tend to get bitten take vitamin B complex prior to your visit. Take bug spray for your room as well and air freshener It is the tropics nothing ever dries and it will be musty. I highly recomend this resort enjoy it

<Content>Short and Sweet Im going to keep it simple..the grounds were lovley. My brother was married and the resort and it was beautiful. The Chinese Resturaunt was my favorite and the Steak house was the least I enjoyed. There were about 40 of us who went for the wedding and most of them were sick, not sure from what but the bar attendant had a remedy that tasted gross but worked for the mean time. I didnt get sick until the day after I returned. I've been to Jamaica and never felt sick at all.....Other than that it was great. Not too many young folks if your looking to party but there is a club about 5mins away thats great..they play lots of different music and other young guys hang there from other resorts so we had fun hanging out there.FYI......The pizza was different but i loved that the most!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful Vacation We just returned from a weeklong stay at Paradisus Punta Cana. My husband and I traveled with a couple of friends, and all 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were slightly worried about the language barrier, but it was never a problem. Everything went very smoothly when we checked-in. Our room wasn't quite ready for us (our friends' room was ready), but we didn't think it was that big of a deal. Within 30 minutes, our room was complete and ready. We did not upgrade to Royal Service, and we don't feel like we missed out on anything. We were very happy with the service we had. Everyone was extremely friendly. Anything that we needed was provided almost instantly (we requested extra pillows and a coffee maker for our room - everything was there waiting for us when we returned to our room a short time later).  The grounds are kept in perfect condition with lots of palm trees and beautiful tropical flowers and plants. The pool was huge and absolutely gorgeous. The water was warmer than I would have preferred, but it was still nice. There was always plenty of chairs available both in the sun and in the shade. There were also beds available by the pool. The beach was extremely clean and beautiful, with plenty of chairs and beds available in both the sun and the shade. Our housekeeper came in each day and left our room nice and clean for us. She left fresh flowers in the bathroom, and bottled water and soft drinks in the refrigerator. The food was much better than I had expected (I read MANY reviews about how bad it was!). We ate at the buffets each day for breakfast and lunch. There was always a big variety to choose from. For dinner, there are lots of restaurants to choose from. We ate at the Seafood, Italian, French, Steakhouse, and Japanese Restaurants. The Japanese was my favorite (I loved the atmosphere and the food), but all of the restaurants were good. You need reservations for the French and Japanese Restaurants. I suggest that you make your reservations as soon as you can, because they do get booked quickly. You can order pizzas to go from the Italian Restaurant. We enjoyed them as a late afternoon snack to hold us over until dinner (we preferred to eat our dinner very late).  We always drank bottled water, and we never got sick. We brushed our teeth with the bottled water as well. We didn't want to take any chances. There a many bars spread throughout the resort. The bartenders are always VERY generous with the alcohol. The drinks are sometimes too strong to drink! If you don't like really strong drinks, just ask them to go easy on the liquor for you.  Many activities are available each day to keep you busy. We went through the Nature Walk and enjoyed seeing the various animals and feeding the monkeys. We also went horseback riding and snorkeling. My husband and I got an hour-long couples massage at the spa. The cost was $85 per person. It was very nice and relaxing. Our friend had a massage by the pool, which was a little cheaper ($60 for 1 hour). We took plenty of small bills to use as tip money, but we didn't feel like we got any extra special service because of tipping. The entire wait staff is extremely friendly. You will often see them singing and dancing as they are walking along! We enjoyed our vacation at Paradisus. I highly recommend this resor

<Content>Awesome Resort My boyfriend and I just returned from Punta Cana. We stayed from June 11th to the 16th. We were really nervous about going to the Paradisus after reading all the negative reviews on Trip Advisor. After the first 10 minutes there we realized that all the negative comments we read were wrong. Everything about the place was awesome. We found friendly service, beautiful grounds, excellent food, amazing beach... The list goes on. We have hardly any negative comments. We found that it was useful to bring a stack of $1 bills for tips. The staff was very appreciative of any tips. Also, be sure you have enough cash on you, incase you want to go on excursions or participate in specific water sports like parasailing. You don't want to run out of money while you're there. We didn't find a place where you could take out American Dollars there, and dealing with the Pesos was a little annoying, but that was our fault! My boyfriend and I loved every restaurant we went to and were upset that we weren't there long enough to go to them all. I don't understand how people could possibly complain about the food. Even most of the sit down dinners had a section of buffett. You would have to be the pickiest eater on earth if you could not find something that you like. Obviously there was some cultural food that seemed unattractive to us and so therefore we didn't eat it. If we would have eaten it we would have probably thought it was bad, but only because it would have been something that we're not accustomed to and not because it was poorly prepared. We had the most amazing time in Punta Cana. We would definitely go back to the Paradisus, and we highly recommend it to our family and friends.

<Content>I cant believe the negative reviews. Place is Perfect!! I can't believe that people complain about this place. My wife and I (2735 yrs old) went there on the first part of our honeymoon from June 1st through the 6th. I cant say enough about how great this place is. We paid for the Royal Service and it is worth it for the private pool (3 months old) and private beach alone. Our room was fine but it really shouldnt matter too much because you should not be in it much. Lots of activities to do but we mostly sat around in the thatched roofed palapas that surround the Royal Service Pool (there are over 25 so it was no problem getting one everyday) or hanging out on the incredibly comfortable beach beds. We also got massages on the beach almost every day for about $30 for 30 minutes. I went Scuba diving at the oil wreck for free one day as well. The food and drink were good. Alcohol was very accessable. We had a six pack delivered to our room with in 10 minutes of being there and they also brought in Champagne and fruit on a couple of occasions. The restaurants are fine. I dont know what all the complaints are about. I think that poeple dont realize that they are in a different country and things taste different. Diet Coke is different so why wouldnt pizza and steak be different. I think this is what causes people to complain. The buffets were great for lunch and we had the private breakfast area for Royal Service each day which was great. At night we liked the Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican and even the Grill which was right on the sand. If you are looking for an amazing food experience this may not be for you but we always enjoyed what we had and got plenty of it. We didnt go for the food anyway you should be there for the beach. The lobby is fun at night but the night life isnt great but we were so relaxed we were in bed by 11:30 almost every night.The beach is pure white sand, very large and bright blue water. Dont know what the compliants about it being rough were or the seaweed. I did notice those people that did complain while they were there. They paid for Royal Service and I guess expected a Butler to be chasing them around all day. Not going to happen. We did not see ours more than 2-3 times because we didnt need much. If we had he would have been there. If you dont ask you wont get. I saw a couple in the Royal Service Area complaining that they ordered two pots of cofee one reg. one decaf and they got a pot of cofee and a pot of hot water. DUH the instant decaf is in your room. Service was great at all times. We brought about $200 to tip with and used it all plus some. We tipped everytime we ate, scuba diving, Horse back riding, drank at bars etc. Overall this was a great hotel and I walked past alot of others along Bavaro beach and there was no comparison. Actually as people from other hotels walked past this one they would always stop and point because it was that much nicer. If you want to relax go here and dont listen to the people that compain becuase the are out of their minds and frankly were very embarrassing to be around. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful Resort.......... Ok - first and foremost.... I had read lots and lots of reviews and was very unsure if I would enjoy my stay. Just came back from a 7 ngt stay from June 3 thru June 10, 2006. I went with my husband, and 2 sons (ages 4 and 13). We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. What a relief..... it was wonderful! The grounds are impeccable and kept very clean. The people were very friendly and went out of there way even with the language barrier. The lobby was gorgeous, especially at night. Food: everything was very tasty from all of the dinner restaurants (which by the way had 9 dinner restaurants: french, mexican, brazilian, chinese, japanese, steakhouse, seafood, italian, and buffet). The morning breakfast buffets were the same everyday - this was just ok, but how many different ways can you create breakfast outside of fruit, oatmeal, meat, eggs, and pancakes? We have to be a little real when thinking about it. The Brazalian and Mexican restaurants were by all means my favorites. The resort had plenty of activities, free and those with a fee, definately always something to do. Room service was always attentative to room requests. Several different bars on the property to enjoy a cold drink at anytime. My oldest son got a kick out of swimming up to the bar and ordering a cool pina colada and chocolate milkshakes while relaxing in the pool. The pool.... was very nice and relaxing; the water was a bit warm - but it was 90 degrees everyday anyways. The rooms....... we had a one bedroom/2 full bath suite which was actually 2 hotel rooms adjoined by french doors. One side of suite had a full bath, partial kitchen (breakfast bar, sink, fridge, a table/chairs), sofabed, loveseat, and a tv.....then the french doors..... other side had 2 full beds, 1 full bath, sofabed, loveseat, and another tv. Both sides had access to the super long balcony. The beds were a little hard, but they will never compare to my sleepnumber at home - so who cares. The beach.......... what can I say - PARADISE! Unbelieveable to say the least. So, to sum up my review..... Paradisus Punta Cana was well worth the trip. To all the people who did not like it, I just think you need to be a little more open to the surroundings and stop comparing the Dominican Republic to the United States.

<Content>Great Resort, Would Highly Recommend. I visited the Paradisus with my girlfriend from May 28th to June 3rd, we are both in our mid-twenties. The grounds in the resort were beautiful just as many of the reviews stated. Before arriving at the resort we called to to confirm our reservations. My girlfriend spoke to one of the gentlemen that worked at the resort and he asked us if there was any specific details we would like in our room. We asked for a room on the top floor, with a pool view and a king size bed. Sure enough when we arrived the exact room we asked for was waiting for us. The food was pretty good considering I'm a picky eater. Every night they had 2 restaurants closed due to the lack of people staying at the hotel. The restaurant closures are understandable, the only problem was every time we planned where we were going to go to dinner it seemed like that restaurant was closed.  We did not book the Royal Service after reading some of the previous reviews. I am actually glad that I didn't because people from the Royal Service were actually coming over into the main pool which is much bigger and nicer. We had no problem making reservations at the French and the Japanese restaurants. Most of the staff were friendly, but I did catch a few of the workers staring at my girlfriend for a little too long which made her a little uncomfortable. The workers at the pool bar were great. They were all friendly and always making everyone laugh. [-----] The only complaints I have about the resort is that I noticed very small ants around the bathroom and some places in the room which I guess came from the plants, and there wasn't much night life. After 12:00am it seemed like everyone went to sleep. They have a fun pub which was crowded one night because they had karaoke, but besides that it seemed like there was never anyone in there. We ended up spending alot of time in the casino. Also, if you are looking to buy souveniers try not to buy them from the gift shop. Everything in there was extremely over priced. Coffee mugs were $15.00, shot glasses were $6.00 or $9.00. Feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions.

<Content>Paradisus is Paradise!!!!! My husband And I read tripadvisor before we left for Punta Cana. After reading all the negative comments we started to get a little nervous. I think that anyone that complains about this place in any way is crazy!!! We had the time of our lives. Every restaurant that we ate in was excellent. Our room was great. The everything was PERFECT!!!!! We are planning to go again next year. We went for an extended Memorial Day weekend, a friend of ours got married there. They did the most beautiful wedding, it was perfect in every way. We ate at the French  Mexican restaurants and the food and service was great. The other 2 nights were rehearsal dinner and reception dinner that were 1st class all the way. The beach was awesome, the pool bar is lots of fun.A vacation is what you make of it. I could not complain about one thing at the Paradisus, even if I tried. Oh and the grounds are kept so beautiful that it is unbelievable!!! I did not see any roaches. The grounds are big but it is walkable and they have shuttles that take you anywhere. The people that work there are so nice. It was helpful to bring a bunch of $1.00 bills, they go along way. The language thing is fine. If you know how to say hello, thank you, and your welcome in spanish then you will be fine. Cant wait til next year to get back to the paradise we found at Paradisus!!!!!

<Content>Paradisus Punta Cana; Returning a Second Time We just returned last night from our second trip to the Paradisus PC staying the week following Memorial Day. Our last visit was during peak season in February 2005 during winter break and this is our first trip to the DR in the official off-season. The weather was spectacular. We had been watching the forecast for the week prior and were concerned about the chance of thunderstorms every afternoon. Well, the weather channel was incorrect. Every day except for one was beautiful unfiltered sunshine. The worst day had some morning light overcast that quickly cleared and a cooling 20 minute afternoon rain shower was just in time for a needed siesta.  Our last trip to 'Paradise' was just that. The only thing that was found to be noticeably different was that due to low census (we nearly had the resort to ourselves, not jam packed as last trip) there were alternating restaurant closures that we did not expect. The usual choice of 10 restaurants was cut by 2 and 3 respectively for dinner. To our surprise, even the reservation restaurants (Japanese and French) took their turn of having the night off. The closures were posted every afternoon, which left some time to alter our plans. Despite that, the cuisine continued to be as excellent as ever with lots of international choices for mildly discriminating palates. The service remains very good considering the pace of the Dominican people is not the NYC style we are accustom to in larger American cities.  We considered upgrading to Royal Service on this trip but did not do so after finding out that if you are on a return visit to the resort (which does require proof) that you can request a room upgrade with your booking agency. We were told in advance that it was based on availability and were not sure if we would get the upgraded room but we indeed did receive the upgrade. We were placed in the Service Reale upgraded deluxe junior suite without the butler services. During our last visit, we looked forward to reading the morning International copy of the Miami newspaper with breakfast or at the pool. Be advised that the hotel states they no longer have the paper available to its guests. They did attempt to go 'above and beyond' by kindly printing off the Internet version of the paper. Despite again being a great vacation to the Paradisus PC, just a few minor details kept it from being as good as it was the first time. No matter, we will likely return again!

<Content>Awesome resort! This is a beautiful resort and a great place to go and relax which was our goal. The grounds are unbelievable - tropical flowers everywhere. There are even speakers inconspicuously all around the grounds so you hear music all the time. The beach is great - wasn't prepared for the topless sunbathers but had no problem with it...just surprised! We loved spending the morning on the beach in one of those huge beds and then after lunch, it was off to the pool where we stayed close to the swim up bar - be sure to try the Banana Poppa drink...yummy! We had massages by the pool and I had a pedicure at the spa - both were super. The only thing that wasn't great was the food. We actually found the best food at the buffets. The worst was at El Romantico - a French restaurant where you needed reservations. It was just terrible. The Italian and Mexican were okay. AND...we actually won at the casino! Another thing I wasn't prepared for was the communication problem...it would be good to have some undertanding of Spanish. Overall, it was a wonderful 6 days.

<Content>Had a relaxing time at Paradisus My husband and I just returned from the Paradisus we were there from May 20-27th and had a great time. This is our 2nd time at the hotel we had been in Oct. 2003 for our honeymoon. This time around we had the Royal Service and I think it was okay but for us not really worth the extra money, I think really what you are paying for is the better room. I LOVED our room building 19 room 1195 it was an ocean view which was great. With the Royal Service you have your choice of pillows and when I called for pillows he wanted they didnt have any and also they ran out of beach towels for the Royal Service however I did enjoy the use of the computers and the a/c breakfast. We had perfect weather all 7 days and the beach was amazing we loved the swim up bars and the food was okay you are in a different country so its NOT the food you are used to eating at home. We did not do any of the tours this time around but we did back in 2003 we did the atv's and that was great and we did the speed boats and that was fun to and we also swam with the dolphins and that was okay. I would recommend doing the atv tour out of all of them it was a blast. Everyone was very friendly the workers and all the people we met on the trip. I would recommend the Paradisus its clean and the grounds are amazing. feel free to contact me if you have any questions

<Content>Amazing Vacation My husband and I just returned from Paradisus Punta Cana. We were there from May 27th thru May 31st. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and I could not have asked for a better place to stay. The service was incredible. When the young lady making our dinner reservations found out it was our anniversary she surprised us for dessert with a whole delicious cake which read Happy Anniversary. I thought that was so sweet of her. I don't know if everyone else did but as a welcome I received a beautiful plant and a bottle of wine sent to my room. The atmoshpere was nice it wasn't there busiest time of the year which was great. The beach was incredible, the hotel was beautiful, the pool was great the restaurants were wonderful(my favorite was the mexican restaurant and the steakhouse).You must try the papaya and banana smoothie at the breakfast buffet(yummy).

<Content>Better than expected I was at this hotel for five nights. The info I read about the place made my visit better, so I would like to return the favor.This was my first all-inclusive. I was a little nervous about doing an all-inclusive because my impression was that they seem pretty cheesy. I must admit that my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised! The grounds are just gorgeous! The food was better than expected, too. Some of the food at the Brazilian and the French restaurants rivaled what I'd expect in a large city. The French restaurant requires reservations, so book as soon as you get there. We didn't have the Royal Service and got by fine without it. It's completely reasonable to walk to the beach from anywhere in the resort. Tips do help...we left our maid a tip each day and in return our refrigerator was stocked with extra waters. The shaded space on the beach goes quickly. The beach code simply requies that you drop any item on a chair and the chair remains yours for the day. We learned to get to the beach early to reserve a more shaded spot. Staff at the resort are very friendly, polite and helpful. We purchased our trip through Expedia, which included very prompt airport transfers. This allowed us to avoid the onslaught of taxi services outside the airport. Also, our experience at Punta Cana's airport went very smoothly. Customs was very quick! In summary, although a stay at this resort will not immerse you in Dominican culture (!), it will provide a relaxing vacation at a beautiful beach.

<Content>Paradise One of the most beautiful places to vacation. Truly felt like we got away from it all. The property was immaculate and the staff wonderful. Resturants were above our expectations. Top-shelf drinks. Would definitely return.

<Content>Had a great time at the Paradisus Punta Cana! My boyfriend and I just returned from Paradisus Punta Cana. We were there from May 19-May24. We are in our early 20's and this was our first vacation together. We had a wonderful time! The beach was beyond words. Long stretched of white sand and turquoise water with just enough waves to be fun but definitely not at all rough. Hardly any seaweed and whenever there was any they swept it right up. I beliebe this was their off season and they were not at full occupancy so we had no problem find lounge chairs in the shade on the beach or by the pool. The pool was also beautiful, huge, and clean. There were plenty of areas to lounge here as well. The pool bar was a lot of fun, especially later in the afternoon. The bartenders have so much energy! You will see the same guys dancing here at the disco at 2 am! The weather was amazing, hot and sunny every day with no sign of rain anywhere. The last day we were there the sun went in and out but it was a relief to be out of the sun for a few minutes! At night it was just as hot, no sweaters needed. We made reservations as soon as we arrived for the Japanese and El Romantico. El Romantico was defintely worth it, beautiful restaurant with great food. We did not care for the Japanese. Beware, the fried rice has fish in it which my boyfriend will not touch and was not aware it was in there until he took his first bite. We also did not feel too well after the Japanese, nothing big just minor stomach aches. We also ate at the Chinese and Mexican and we loved the food. No stomach problems and we even went to the Chinese place a second time. We also tried the Italian restaurant for lunch, really good pizza and you can take it to go to the beach or pool. None of the restaurants had a wait longer than 10 minutes if that. The lobby bar was fun at night to have a few drinks and watch the other guests dance to salsa and merengue music. They also had shows each night but we only really caught one that spanned from the 1900's to 2000 so they played good music. The club The Fun Pub was good I think it was a Saturday or Sunday night. The other nights there were hardly any people in it. They also had a pool table in there. I think this was the only part of the resort lacking, there should have been more nightlife but other than that everything was great. On Tuesday night they had a fun party on the beach also. We also had a massage on the beach ($30 for 30 minutes) which was awesome. The ecological walk was fun with cute birds and monkeys. They had other excursions but we just wanted to relax. The service was great. They always had a smile on their faces and would help you with anything they could. I do not know what people are talking about who say they don't speak English. Yes, their English is not perfect but it was definitely better than our Spanish and we always got our point across. On the last night my boyfriend asked them to put flowers and candles in the room and surprised me. It was so beautiful. Definitely bring $1's and $5's for tipping. All in all it was a great relaxing and romantic vacation and we definitely cannot wait to go back!

<Content>Amazing Wedding!!! We got married at the Paradisus Punta Cana!! It was sooo amazing! It was the most beautiful wedding ever. The first week of our stay our friends came down with us, my husbands parents came fro 3 days and for the wedding. The wedding was on the 6th day and our friends and family left on the 7th day. The 2nd week was our honey moon. We had awesome weather, it only rained for 1 and a half days at the very beginning. The first week the afternoons got clouded over but it was nice to have a break from the sun by then anyway.The room we had was royal service, building #30, room 2303, I swear the best room and location, we were right on the beach.I have some tips for you.... If you like budweiser beer, which we do, you have to really push for it to get it , b/c they like to sell their Presidente...which is fine to, but we love our Bud! lolThe Royal Service is worth it for sure, you get way bigger and better beach towels, they make your dinner reservations for you, you get a better and fresher breakfast and just better service all around. But the main thing you pay for is the room location, which is close to the beach. The trains that drive around are awesome for getting drunk and then going on tour! We had a blast!Go to the lobby bar and ask 'Socrates for a Polka Polka!!! He is the best bartender and is the only one who knows what this drink is. It is the best drink ever!I have tons more I could tell you so email me if you wanna ask any q's!beks_roper@hotmail.com

<Content>Thought this was a great place!!!!! We returned yesterday from a week at the resort and thought it was great. We have been to a few different all inclusives 3 Beaches resorts, 2 Couples, a Club Med I thought Paradisus was a step up from all of these. The grounds are absolutely lush and beautiful it was enjoyable just to walk around and look at the grounds. It is so clean and the beaches are beautiful. The rooms are very nice. We got the Royal Service and when we first got there we got a room that didn't met our requests (king bed, no smoking, ocean view) they quickly changed our room to what we requested. The Royal Service is well worth it. You get to have breakfast in a small private A/C room, seperate beach and pool area and room service at the dial of the phone. The beach is beautiful, food is very good, drinks with top shelf liqour. The specialty resturants were very good and the service was great. We celebrated our 25th anniversary there and had reservations in the French resturant. They set a table with rose petals, bouquet of flowers and even a delicious chocolate cake just for us. It was so nice. The previous writer complained about the excursions and our experience with that was not a good one either but that really has little to do with the hotel. Our excursion sell job came from the tour company not the hotel. Our excursion to Somomoa Island was a big fiasco. My advise is don't waste your money. One day I walked by myself to the shopping just up the street from the hotel. I had asked many staff members and they assured me I would be safe and I was not uncomfortable at all. The natives try to be pushy but not in a threatining way at all. The hotel also has a night were townies come in with a flea market. The only issue we had was a little GI stuff one day but it wasn't bad, not enough to stop us from beaching it. We were told it may have been from brushing our teeth with sink water. ONLY USE BOTTLED WATER !!!! The ice is bagged and water in the resturants is bottled so that is fine. The staff speaks mainly spanish this was an issue on occasion but they are very helpful, pleasant and will get someone who can speak better English. It was a great place and a great week I would go back again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great service When we arrived at the resort we were met by Elvis who took us directly to the front of the line because we were owners of a Sol Melia timeshare. Check in was very quick and they whisked us off to our room. the room was' nt quite ready yet so we walked over to the Italian resturant and had a very good late lunch. After lunch we went back to the room which was just fantastic. Two bathrooms, a kitchen, living room, a sitting room, and bedroom. We ate at all the resturants during our stay, and they were all very good. Service was better than we expected thru-out our stay. We also took a tour into Higeay and had a good time. The cab driver didnt speak english, but we managed to relate where we wanted to go. We went to the church and we were met by a quide that spent an hour walking thru the church with just the two of us. He spoke pretty good english. Most of the time we just layed around and relaxed, this was our intent for the vacation. The beach was wonderful and the grounds were beautiful. We only spent a short time at the pool but it was very large and not that crowded. We would defintely stay at this resort again if it wasnt so far, as we live in Seattle. They have the same resort in Costa Rica and we've already started planning for our stay there next year.

<Content>No Customer Service 1.When we got to the hotel, There were many employees who were standing around doing nothing. No one offtered any assistance.2. We booked an excursion at the hotel desk to see the island and to go shopping. The guide did not speak any english. We spent over an hour driving to our destination. Once we got there, We were afraid to get out the van. The area was dirty and smelled horrible. We lasted two minutes here and the driver wanted to take us to a church which was another 25 minutes away. This lasted 5 minutes. Only to drive back to the hotel. On the way back to the hotel, NOT 5 MINUTES from the hotel, was a really nice place to go shopping. The Hotel people saiid that there was no place nearby to shop.3. Only about 5 employees in the hotel, did a decent job.If you are looking for a place with a wonderful beach this is the place to go. Do not excpect any good service.

<Content>A stunning resort I will try to make this review sound different then all of the rest that have been written, by I find myself agreeing with so many of the positive things people said about the resort that it is hard to deviate from the most obvious comments.Let me say that not enough can be said of the beauty of the resort. Everything is stunning (see title.) The beach is just plain amazing. Water, sand, palm trees, palapa huts, tanning beds, ocean breeze, beach bar, etc. The list goes on. I spent most of my week on the beach and never got used to the beauty of it.Pool, also amazing. Great pool bar, very large, volleyball games and boozing in the afternoons...alcohol and swimming...always a good combination.Restaurants were great for dinner! Breakfast and lunches were really nothing to brag about in my opinion, but my girlfriend and I were very impressed with all of the restaurants for dinner. I think our favorite was the Brazilan Rodizio, very delicious meats. French was nice and fancy, Italian good--good for lunch as well and pizza everyday for a late afternoon snack, Japanese was good for all-inclusive standards, mexican was your typical mexican food--can't really mess that up too much, seafood- great grilled lobster...seriously an all-inclusive that serves lobster? I don't want to read anymore poor comments about the food...crazy people.Side note, I did not get sick from the food, but by weeks end my girlfriend did. I took acidophilius pills and pepto while I was down there...not sure if it helped, but it didn't hurt. Look into it. Room- Well you can look at the pictures on any website of the rooms, theres no surprise there. You have a bed and two small couches. Nice outdoor balcony too. I've heard of 'odors' and the like, but I didn't experience that. I don't put much weight on the room to dictate how I felt about the resort...because quite honestly you shouldn't go to an island resort and worry too much about the room...just my opinion. Also, my girlfriend knocked the tv over and we had a hard time getting it to work right again...so if your tv isn't working, blame her. I did. What else...excursions we did were a lot of fun. They don't really have anything to do with the resort, but I'll recommend the ATV tours and horseback riding. Which by the way is included, so it does have to do with the resort afterall. Do the horseback riding...sign up when you first get there so they're not all booked, it's a good time. If you see Jefferson tell him hello. (He was my horse, a good guy)Tips...I listened to the 4,000 previous reviews and brought a wad of singles. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high or what, but I didn't necessarily feel like my tips went 'so far'. Of course they appreciate them and of course they're happy to get them since they don't make a lot of money, and of course you feel good doing so, so tip them. The service is very good to begin with that a few bucks in my opinion doesn't make the service that much greater. Plus I tipped at the end of meals and services so I wouldn't have been able to receive better service anyway. I hope that confuses all of you...but just tip anyway. Other than that, there is not much more to say. The resort is great, island is great, you should have an amazing time if you go there to relax and enjoy the beach and sun and the whole beauty of the place. We sure did. Stay tuned for photos.

<Content>Best place in Punta Cana I recommend everyone to stay here! The hotel is very nice, huge resort, you don't even have to leave the resort. The only bad thing I can say is the food is average, unless you make a reservation at one of the better restaurants! The staff are overly friendly! What I love about this place are the BEDS on the beach! It has a Miami chic look to it. It's fabulous! I went with family and friends, I do think that Punta Cana is a great place for couples unless a bunch of singles go together. There aren't many clubs like in Cancun if your looking to party. But its an excellent place to take excursions on the island and relax.

<Content>A great vacation! I just returned from the Paradisus Punta Cana 5/11 to 5/15 and I am ready to go back. This was my 1st trip to DR  also my 1st trip alone, so I was pretty nervous especially after reading the recent reviews. I had so much fun at the Paradisus. The staff was very friendly  helpful. No, they do not speak a lot of English but they try very hard to understand what you're trying to say. I spent most of my time by the pool, the pool is just wonderful. The bartender at the pool bar was a lot of fun. The shows during the evening were entertaining. I can't find anything about this hotel that I would complain about. I stayed at a wonderful hotel  met a bunch of wonderful people, what more can you ask for in a vacation!

<Content>This a great place! I honestly believe that the people that posted negative reviews about this resort must have been on something!! My husband and I stayed @ Paradisus Punta Cana for 8 days and wished it would have been at least 10! The resort and beach are beautiful! All of the staff are so friendly and professional. The service we received was really great everywhere we went. The resort is 11 years old, but you'd never know it! We were in building 11, close to the beach, pools, and restaurants. Speaking of restaurants, we ate at most of them. The breakfast buffet was really good. Especially the fresh fruit and pastries! We ate @ the Italian restaurant twice for lunch and it was delicious. We also got pizza to-go and ate it @ the pool...yummy! Our favorite restaurant was the Mexican;DELICIOUS. Japanese was great, Chinese- good, French-good. Our least favorite was the steak place. The horseback riding was fun, and the snorkeling was ok too. The boat ride to the reef was a lot of fun. The nightly shows were very entertaining, especially the one on the beach. DON'T MISS IT! We liked the beach bar the best. The music and atmosphere were PERFECT.The employees work very very hard. We brought plenty of dollar bills and 5's, and they were always appreciated! Shopping @ Bavaro Plaza, a 2 minute cab ride away, was interesting! The shop workers are very persistant! Bargaining can be a bit of a pain in the butt. My suggestion, offer what YOU think it is worth, if they say NO, walk away. If your offer is reasonable, they will sell it to you.Would I go back? YES. Best part of the trip...relaxing on the king sized beach beds under the palm trees with my husband next to me....oh ya, that and the massage on the beach! $60.00 for 1 hour. The mudslides are great too. And then there are the flamingos that roam freely, and the nature walk. I could go on and on. Don't hesitate. The resort and everything about it was terrific. Have fun and a mudslide for me...Daisysmama :)

<Content>Nice but wouldn't go back My husband and I stayed at the resort from 4/23-4/28. First I'd like to say the resort is very nice and well maintained. However, it's huge so be prepared for a lot of walking. Shuttle cars are everywhere as are the fumes. There are many restaurants to chose from but some require reservations. We had the royal service (well worth it) so reservations were made for us. The good part: the pool is beautiful, and huge. Swim up bar was really cool. Beach is awesome. Blue water, white sand. Because we had royal service, we had our own VIP lounge (for all royal service guests). Wonderful pastries, appetizers, breakfast and drinks served everyday at the lounge. Free internet service, staff very pleasant and accomodating. Room service was wonderful.Not so good: if you don't speak Spanish, sometimes it can become frustrating to communicate with staff. Most of the maids do not speak English. I speak some Spanish so that saved some frustration. Parents...be prepared for your children to see topless women! Especially on the beach. Ok...the bad part: We became very ill toward the end of our stay, major cramps and intestinal problems. Though we only drank bottled water, some of the food or prepared fruit most likely had bacteria on it. The refridgeration is not very good at the resort so don't expect ice cold bottled or canned drinks (except at the VIP lounge). Again, staff were very helpful and friendly but we don't plan to return.

<Content>Perfect Trip We just returned from a weeks stay at Paradisus Punta Cana from 4/30 to 5/5. All we can say is WOW. The trip was perfect in every way. We are both in are early 40's and travel a fair amount and must say this resort was one of the most beautiful places we have ever seen. From the pristine grounds that are always being maintained to the breath taking beach you know you are truly in paradise. But more then anything to us were the people of the resort and just how wonderful they were. Everyone we encountered was so so freindly and willing to do what ever to make us happy, and always with a smile. We did not experience any problems with the language barrier as everyone we came across we were either able to get across what we were asking or someone else would come up and help. A little patience goes a long way and remember your on vacation so just relax and enjoy. We did see a few people getting upset if a drink took a few minutes or having to wait 10 minutes to get into a restaruant. Gee I've seen people in the staes wait a hour to get into an Outback Stakehouse or an Olive Garden. Just order a drink and relax in really beautiful waiting areas, no big deal at all.We booked a Royal Service suite and really enjoyed the extras. The VIP lounge was great and we used it all the time. Nelson our butler was just great and hooked me up with a nice suprise for my girl friend as he set up a romantic evening in our room with flower pedels on the floor, a bottle of bubbly and the juccuzzi tub filled and ready to go. My girl friend was so suprised. He also took care of our fair well dinner at the French resturuant and they had a table in the corner covered with rose pedals and flowers. The look on my girlfriens face was priceless and again she was so suprised. Thanks so much Nelson. The Royal Service rooms we great and the location was perfect, right by the Royal Service pool and close to the beach and main resturants. I would recomend the Royal Service if can do.The beach is why we choose this resort and all I can say is WOW. Just beautiful with white sand and clear blue water. Very little sea weed and every morning they cleaned up what wash up on shore. You just can't get that here in the states. We took advantage of the sail boats that we offered to us and took them out on 2 different day's. What a great way to see the entire area. One day up north the next time down south. Very cool. The water is so clear even hundreds of feet off shore you could see the bottom on the ocean and sailing over parts of the coral reef was awesome. You should take advantage of this when your there.The food was good. Not great but good and so many choices. We really liked the seafood, French and mexican places but all were good. If food is your number thing on vacation then you might be disappointed. There was plenty of booze including some good stuff like Absolute Vodka and Beefeater Gin. Just ask for it and you'll get it. I'm not a beer drinker but after trying the presidente beer I might have to reconsider, it was really good stuff. Try it and I believe you'll be hooked to.We went to the lobby bar at night and always someting going on. A great place to just hang out and relax. We did catch 2 shows and thought they we very entertaing with so much energy. It's not quite Vegas but it sure was fun. We stopped by the casino one night. Not all that and we figured we would just wait to gamble when we go back to Vegas. We also enjoyed walking back to our at night, the resort is just stunning when the lights are on the walk help us to relax and unwind before turning in.All in all everything went just perfect for us. I believe the people of the resort made all the difference, they were absolutley wonderful and really went out of there way to make us feel at home, which we did. It was very hard to leave and we would go back tomorrow if we could. I can not recomend this resort enough. It is truly paradise in every way. I would also say this a resort that is better off for couples then familys. I did see some kid's there and after hours it seems like theres not much for them to do. The DR is a developing area and does not have as many things for kids like other more developed areas so if traveling with kids keep that in mind. If your looking for an absolutly beautiful place to get away from it all and just relax then Paradisus Punta Cana would be a perfect spot to go. You will not want to leave.

<Content>Beautiful Resort I and my two best friends go on a trip every year, and we decided this year to go to the Carribean. We had three goals: relax, spend time on a beach, and not break the bank -- as we seem to de every year on our trips! We accomplished all of our goals at this resort. It was beautifully maintained - the grounds, the rooms, even the bathrooms. We could not imagine what the nay-sayers who wrote some of the reviews were talking about! Do not believe them. And, we're picky! Also, we did not go during Spring Break, and the first few days we felt like we had the resort to ourselves.The beaches are amazing and the waters pristine. The rooms were comfortable and spacious -- though the beds were not terrific, they were fine. The service was great and very friendly -- though the waiters could be a bit familiar. The grounds were lush and simply gorgeous. We never swam in the main pool -- we used the pool at the spa which was quiet and basically private as no one else was using it. The massages there are awesome by the way!Do bring the $1's. They came in handy -- and bring many -- they were all very nice. Don't expect the food to be fantastic -- we ate mostly at the buffet at the seafood restaurant on the beach, and the breakfasts and lunches were very good -- dinner, don't expect much. The Chinese Restaurant was good -- and the Italian place was decent. Nothing was awful though. I would definitely go back during the week -- I would steer clear of the weekends though -- there were a TON of very loud people that came in on Friday -- however, we discovered on the next to last day, that there is a beach that extends to the right after the Royal Service beach, that is very quiet and is part of the resort -- actually, I guess I would go back on the weekends. We only went to the nightclub and main area one night, and it was extremely cruise shippy -- expect it if you go. We never left the resort -- except for one walking trip down to a shopping area about a mile down the beach -- it was worth it as we bought a painting for not much $$ -- bargain with them -- they are incredibly pushy with their cheapy cheapy prices. The snorkeling is included and is a fun short trip in a speed boat -- it was a ton of fun but quick -- only about a half hour -- we should have gone every day.It was a really fun trip -- and it was all for $530 per person (hotel and food -- the massages were $85 for an hour and well worth it).

<Content>Disappointed Overall, i was disappointed with the Paradisus. I will break it down between pros and cons, with cons first (that is a longer list)Cons:Food- The food was edible and we didnt try all the restuarants. The buffets were average at best, with some very funky stuff which i wouldnt touch. If you want to eat at Japanese of French you will need to make reservation immediately or forget it. Chineese we arrived one night at 8 and told there was at least 45 minute wait. Ate at either Mexican or Italian, Mexican good but very limited menu. Must wear pants in Mexican for some reason, i didnt know this first night, they sat us outside and we got attacked by mosquoties. Also, met many people who got sick after eating at steak house. My wife and i still not feeling right and we have been back for 4 days and we didnt really get sick....Bugs- Speaking of bugs, my first morning i got up, went into bathroom and there was a cockroach in the sink the size of a small child. Also, little ant like things crawling on bathroom counter, someone we met said get rid of plant they have in there, that worked.Room service- Food not bad but some days it took a lot longer then they promised.Keys- For some reason our keys didnt work one day, the maid let us in then had to wait over an hour for new keys to be delivered.Staff- Overall pleasant, but asked for a wake up call one morning and never got itDrinks- At some bars, namely the beach bar, mixed drinks tasted like medicine and at lobby bar the bartenders were sloooooooowwwwwwwww and it seemed like we bothered them.There are more little things but i wont bore youPROS:THe beach is great, clean, water warm and beds to lie on. Pool is also nice.Grounds are kept great, quite nice actually. Easy to get around and laid out well.Casino fun but watch out for dealers, they have problems countingStaff decent but most speak limited english.Overall i will never go back to Dominican republic and probably not do another Paradisus

<Content>Nice place but if going with teenagers, please read on Pros: excellent beach, food is very good (there are nine restaurants, all are very good, so why do some of us Americans get so ugly and obnoxious if we can't get a table at one of them?), junior suite room is better than most (although beds and pillows are hard.) Weather was perfect. Service is good. Relaxation is a definite possibility, if you can avoid........Cons: too many drunken teenagers smoking too many all inclusive cigarettes. Lots of smoke everywhere. Parents should beware of the disco (opens at midnight) that was filled with drunken smoking teens (average age 15 to 16?) with porn playing on tvs. Some employees were also approaching kids with offers of drug sales. This is a hard place to relax with teenagers.

<Content>If You Go, You Are In For A Treat Just returned on Sunday 04/30/06. My husband and I are 50 and 51 and have been to all carib islands. This was a first time in PC. Upon arriving the time getting off the plane to checked into our room was less than 1 1/2 hours and that was including the 25 min taxi ride for $25US. We had the Servicio Real. We were in building 19 room 2196, 2nd floor ocean fromt, ocean view. Room was lovely and clean. Our butler was Nelson, he was the BEST. There were tiny ants in bathroom sink, just dump the flower and problem solved. We also has ants above the mini bar, keep sugar packets in the mini bar and again problem solved. Did not get any bug bites. Suggestion, bring Febreeze or oust for the closet as it is a carib country and mildew and dampness is part of that. Spray closet everyday and problem solved. The staff were excellent, friendly and accommodating. The beach was breathtaking and the pool a blast. The food was very good for an AI. I did get sick one night, husband did not. I think it was the vodka, rum or what ever else I drank that day. The ice is bagged ice and I did drink and brush with the bottled water. There is some toplessness, not a big deal, they walk the beach from all the resorts. I say if it bothers you don't look. I never saw anyone nude. I would absolutly return to this resort and gave a 5 star for a 3rd world country. Mind you it is not the Ritz but it was also not the Ritz prices. We also did not have a language barrier as our high school spanish worked for a SPANISH SPEAKING COUNTRY. It is a very diversed resort but this past week we met a lot of Americans as well as a lot of nice people from all over the world. Go, you will enjoy!!!

<Content>Las Vegas Las Vegas in the Dominican Republic! The property was nice, although too large. The pool bar was crowded with drunks and smokers by 12 noon so that the kids couldn't get near the bar to order. The food was poor too. All that we could deal with but the beach was crowded and noisy, motor boats cruisng by all day long. The only staff at the resort that were accomodating were at the front desk. My 2 daughters (16, 14) were whistled at by the staff on several occasions. We checked out after one day and went to Club Med! It was a fabulous week at Club Med instead.

<Content>Relaxing vacation! This was our first trip to the Caribbean, and we enjoyed the Paradisus Punta Cana. My boyfriend and I visited from April 23rd to April 29th. I guess we missed the Spring Break crowd because the hotel did not seem overbooked to us when we traveled. Our major purpose of our vacation was to relax, and we did just that. We mostly spent the mornings by the pool and the afternoons on the beach. Nights were spent enjoying the restaurants and nightly entertainment.Pool 鈥?We found the pool to be very relaxing with seats in the sun or shade. Many people had reserved their chairs early in the morning with their belongings, but we were able to find two chairs in the sun at the beginning of the week and two chairs in the chair by the end of the week. Beach - The entire beach is breathtaking at first site. The water is so blue that I felt as if I was looking at a picture. The beach area was very clean, except the cigarette butts that visitors left behind. We also were able to find chairs at the beach. Occasionally we enjoyed the large beds as well. The water was a little rougher than I thought, but we still enjoyed cooling off in the ocean. Activities - They are many activities offered by the resort, but we just wanted to relax the entire week. We tried to go horseback riding, but it was already full. We realize that was our own fault by not making reservations on the day we arrived. We did decide to take the advice of a previous visitor and walk to the neighboring stores along the beach. We did not realize it was going to be almost an hour walk in the hot sun. My boyfriend ended up getting terrible sunburn from the intense sun because we did not think we would be as long as we were. I am not the type of person that likes being attacked and pressured into looking into someone鈥檚 shop, so this excursion was not for us. We ended up leaving without buying anything because I am just not into bargaining.Restaurants 鈥?We really enjoyed all the meals at the Paradisus Punta Cana. We never got sick from any of the food. Our favorites were the Steakhouse, Brazilian, and Japanese. We also enjoyed the Chinese, Italian, Mexican and both buffets. We were a little surprised to find out the menu was smaller than it looks because there are four languages printed in each menu. This was not a problem, but we just thought we were going to have more selections at each restaurant. Honestly, we enjoyed all the meals we had during our vacation. It is important to go with an open mind, and realize that you are in one country that is trying to cook meals from all over the world. Plus, if you are not happy with the meal, go somewhere else because it is all included!!!!!!!! Room 鈥?We were very impressed with our room. Our air conditioner worked too well to the point we turned it off on the last day. Many people had complaints that the rooms needed to be updated, but we were satisfied with the room. We did not expect them to replace the sink or tub because of a crack. We did not notice any weird smells as other visitors had stated. The maids did a great job keeping the rooms clean. We always had enough towels, and the maids made sure by checking back throughout the day. Our refrigerator was not stalked every day, but we just asked for water, and it was delivered to our room promptly.We also took many single bills with us. We did leave a tip for the maid, waiters for dinner, and the bartenders. We did not go through $100 as some other visitors did. Just make sure you take plenty of sunblock, and keep reapplying. One part of the trip that was confusing to us was the airport. We had no clue what we were doing, so we just followed the crowd and did just fine. The lines to check your bags and going through security can be long. There is also the possibility of your flight being pushed up, so just make sure that you get to the airport on time. I think when they see everyone is at the airport they try to get the planes loaded. They were even calling people individually, so I don鈥檛 think they would leave anyone behind.Overall, we enjoyed our vacation. Not everyone is going to love everything about a vacation, so go with an open mind and RELAX!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Well, it was OK....... - - - About Us: I am 41 and my wife is 39; both working professionals. We also brought out 12-year-old daughter and our 2-陆 year old son. We reside within the United States. I have traveled to China, Singapore, many countries in Europe, Canada, just about every state in the Unites States, the Bahamas and more. This was the first time taking the children out of the U.S. in preparation for more extensive trips the years to come. I should mention my wife speaks a little Spanish and I the typical common words. - - - The Resort: Paradisus Punta Cana as a whole was wonderful. The property is very large and full of wonderful landscaping that will just draw you in. As soon as we set foot off the bus from the airport, an employee took our luggage and then moved it to one location. He then motioned us to follow him and took us to a pedestal with a list of names on an 8x12 sheet of paper 鈥?this was a list of the Royal Service residents. When I told him that our family name was on the paper, he quickly waived down another employee, spoke a little Spanish, loaded our luggage and directed us to get on the cart as well. Needless to say, my first tip went in that direction. We were then whisked away to the Royal Service check in. - - - The Other Guests: There were a couple of the 鈥淯gly Americans鈥?making their presence well known 鈥?these people disgust me. Otherwise, the other guests were wonderful. I had conversations with people from Germany, Australia, Canada, England, and of course, the U.S. - - - The Rooms: We were in building 30, second floor and room #8. This translates to 2308. The building was right on the beach and we had a view of the beach as well as the Garden Villa right across from us. I will admit that I was a little disappointed in the room. The sleeping area, sitting area, and balcony were not bad. The bathroom area was in need of some attention. The dark wood that they used to create makeshift shelves and shutter type doors really dulled down the area and was not pleasing to the eye. Also, the first thing I noticed when walking into the room was an odor. I know I smelled that odor before, but where? It wasn鈥檛 until I was changing my son鈥檚 diaper that I remembered where. I don鈥檛 think the odor originated in the room as I also noticed it outside while walking to the room one day. Perhaps because our bungalow was right next to another resort, there was some sort of septic/sewage system close by and the use of the air conditioner brought that stench into our room. Add to this the tropical climate and the odor/musty smell was very evident throughout the room. It also remained in our luggage for a week or so after returning.Also, the beds are VERY hard. The padding and carpeted floors in our house seem to be more comfortable than the beds.Overall, room was OK. After all, the room is NOT why you go to Punta Cana. I think the ONLY thing you will have as an advantage with Royal Service is location to the beach. The bungalow was close to the beach, but it was the farthest away from everything else 鈥?as far as Royal Service is concerned.  - - - The Food: This is the area we had the biggest concern over. Not so much for my wife and I, but for our children. All I can say is WOW! What a selection. We had reservations for the Italian, Japanese, and the Steak House. We went to the Italian place and found that we were not doing a service to other guests around us with our son, so we decided to cancel our other reservations. We did not want to ruin anyone else鈥檚 experience. The Italian food we did eat was wonderful.We decided to stick with the buffet as we can eat and leave at our pace with minimal disruption. My daughter is convinced that they have the best French toast at the Hibiscus as well as the best pasta dishes. - - - The Drinks: El Presidente!! My wife ordered a few of the tropical type drinks (margaritas, daiquiris, etc) but thought the alcohol was way too much. - - - The Service: I hear tipping goes a long way. I brought $200 in ones to tip so that we can get greater 鈥淩oyal Service鈥?attention. I left a $5 tip each day for the maid service and also requested that the mini bar be filled with 4 Presidente and 4 bottles of water each day. This NEVER occurred. We did order room service once and the pizza and Presidente were delivered real quick. All and all, I was eager to give out all the ones I had brought. I tipped $2 each time and only handed out a total of $40 in ones and 4 $5 bills to the maids.The Royal Service check in was excellent and the people there were very accommodating to the demands of my 2-year-old son when he blurted out, 鈥淚 want some milk!鈥?br/> - - - The Employees: Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!! In less than a day, they had my 2 year old saying HOLA to everyone! They would hold up their hands requesting a 鈥渉igh five鈥?from my son and they ALWAYS had a smile! If I did not know how to say something in Spanish, they would do their best to determine what my need was and teach me a little Spanish as well. I even had the opportunity to view them putting up with a couple of 鈥淯gly Americans鈥?and they maintained their composure and dignity. Something we could all learn from.KUDOS to the wonderful people of the Paradisus Punta Cana! - - - The Beach: WOW! What a wonderfully maintained beach. I got up early one morning to watch the sunrise and to snap some photos. The employees were out cleaning all the seaweed off the beach so that it was clean for the guests. The chaises were lined up each night as guests made their way to dinner and they had security on the beach all night.The water was beautiful, inviting, and fun!Caution: I found the morning sun to be more brutal than the afternoon! We typically did the beach in the morning and the pool in the afternoon that may be part of the reason. However, it did cloud up in the afternoon providing a little more protection. - - - The Pool: I have never seen such a wonderful pool. Cleaned every night and ready for guests first thing in the morning. Pool hours were from 8am to 6pm. This pool was HUGE! At one point, there must have been at least 100 guests in this pool and I had no problem getting around and playing with my children. - - - The Activities: Did not participate in much as this was a family chill week and that is all we did! - - - The Worst: Leaving Punta Cana. Not that we would miss the place, but the airport was a complete nightmare!! We arrived at the airport at noon for a flight at 2:15. It took forever to get through the Delta check in. They manually check each piece of checked luggage. Our luck had us stuck behind a family of 6 who tried to arrange to have all their seats next to each other during the whole trip back. FYI to the Ugly American鈥?DO THIS BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!Once we went through check in, we were all 鈥渃orralled鈥?into another area that prepped us for check through customs. When I say 鈥渃orralled鈥?I mean just that. There was no line, just a big mass of people pushing towards a gate that was blocked by officials. At this time, we had been standing in the airport for more than an hour. There is no air conditioner, there is no vending machines for water, and it was HOT!! I was very concerned about the health of my children and nobody cared. We just stood there with HUNDREDS of other people at the mercy of the customs people.After getting through the corral gate, we then stood in one of four lines (yep, that was all they had for the hundreds if not more than a thousand people ready to leave the island) for another 40 minutes. After that, we had to stand in ANOTHER line to go through passport/boarding pass check and through the metal detectors. If it weren鈥檛 for the Delta rep coming through and calling for Delta passengers, we would have been in that line for another hour. Instead, it was only 15 minutes as they shuffle us to the front.All in all, it took us more than 2 hours in the heat of the airport to run to our plane that had already boarded.This experience alone was enough to ruin our vacation. I will NEVER complain of the lines at O鈥橦are, LaGuardia, or Frankfurt again! NEVER!! - - - In Conclusion: On a scale of 1 to 5, I would give the resort experience alone a 3. I have never experienced a 5 as I feel these type of place 鈥渁nticipate鈥?your needs and react.The combined experience of the DR from beginning to end was about a 2.5.Would I recommend the Paradisus Punta Cana 鈥?YES! Would I return? Well, we decided that the DR was good for once every 3 years or so and that we would probably try another resort the next time.

<Content>Pretty good time My boyfriend and I just returned from a 5 day stay at Paradisus. Because I am a teacher, we had to go during the Spring Break week, April 17- 21. As another review said, it was very crowded and there were a lot of kids, but they all seemed very well-behaved and did not interfere with our time. I do think that Paradisus was operating at full capacity, as it was VERY difficult to eat dinner. When we arrived on Monday, we rushed to make dinner reservations for the week only (you can only make reservations in person from 8 to 3 pm) to find out that the better restaurants that required reservations, French and Japanese, were already booked through Sunday. That was very disapointing. Then, each night, we had to wait at least an hour or more to eat dinner. It seemed that the Royal Service people were able to make reservations for all the restaurants and that's why there was such a wait. The food was good, not the same quality as a cruise, but pretty good. Neither of us got sick. Also, perhaps because of the overcrowding, the service in the restaurants, especially the italian, was not great. The waiters seemed very overwhelmed, but were always polite. There was never a problem understanding each other. I was embarassed by other Americans who were rude and upset that the staff doesn't speak English. We were in a Spanish speaking country and the staff has people coming from many countries. If would be impossible to expect them to be fluent in all languages. I think that they were familiar with a few important words and that was enough. I would say that the difficulty eating dinner was the worst part of our trip.The whole resort was beautiful and clean. The grounds and the beach were so well maintained. There was no garbage, rocks or glass in the sand or on the grounds at all, which is impressive since so many people are drinking on the beach and leave their garbage behind. There were ample chairs available both in and out of shade. The beach was very pretty. The ocean was clear and what you expect from a carribbean beach. There were small waves close to the shore, not as big as some of these reviews state. Once you go out a little, the water is still. Every restaurant and the lobby were decorated nicely and was very clean. I was impressed with all of the facilities. The casino was small, but fun. The shows were entertaining. There is plenty to do at night.The pool was great and also very clean. The pool bar was a lot of fun after a long day on the beach. The drinks in all of the bars were very good and I didn't have to wait very long at any time. There was a wide variety of liquors and many drinks were made from fresh fruit, except for the Pina Coladas and Strawberry Daquaris. We had a standard king size room. It was nicely decorated and clean and the air conditioner worked fine, but there was a musty smell in the room. I was not surprised, since we were in a tropical climate, but it is kind of annoying that my clothes still smell after washing them a couple of times. A couple of tips, bring bug spray or a suncreen with bug repellent. I didn't feel myself getting bit, but we both came home with many bug bites. Also, singles are good to bring, as well. The staff works hard and deserves a tip for good service. Some reviews said to bring $100 per person in singles and that's way too much. $75 total was plenty for us. Also, watch out for your return flight. Get to the airport early. For some reason, our boarding pass and airline ticket both said boarding at 1:05, take off at 2:45, as did everyone on the plane. However, at 1:15 people started yelling our fligh number and rushing us through security. Our plane ending up taking off at 1:45. Overall, we had a good time on this trip. It was very relaxing and definetly worth the money which was not a lot compared to other all inclusive islands or a cruise. This is a good place to come just to relax for a few days on the beach.

<Content>Don't go during spring break I hate whiny reviews, but as I use this website alot for vacation planning, I feel obliged to share our experience. Our family went to the Paradisus during spring break and our experience was pretty mixed. The resort was way overcrowded that week, but Americans seemed to be the minority, so I'm not sure how much of this was due to spring break. It was difficult to get into restaurants that you wanted. There were alot of scenes of very upset people unable to get into restaurants. We kept the same grimy beach towels the whole week because every time we went to exchange them, the hotel was out of beach towels. We had arranged through the hotel to have someone pick us up at the airport and no one came and the hotel had no explanation why and no records of who even was supposed to pick us up. Our room had an adjoining door to the room next door and when the guy next door was on the phone, it sounded like someone was in our room. My husband had fairly bad stomach trouble for over week during and after our trip. Though the beach was beautiful, and I thought the food and service in the restaurants was pretty good, I wouldn't go back. We went to the RIU Negril in Jamaica last spring break and had a much better experience for much less money.

<Content>4 1/2 stars my A$$ ! I want to keep this short and simple. We paid for the royal service and a deluxe junior suite and all we got was a royal pain in the a$$. We arrive on 4/20 and we are told our room would not be ready till 4/21 so we were moved to the hotel next door in which our room smelled of mildew and room service limited us to one beer per guest. So on 4/21 around 1pm we head back to the paridisus. After being told 7 minutes, then 30 minutes then 40 minutes our room wasn鈥檛 ready till 6:30. When we spoke to our VIP concierge we couldn鈥檛 get into any of the 2 restaurant that you need a reservation to get into. The next available reservation was Monday when we had to leave on Sunday. finally get to our room to find 2 full sized beds not the king we ordered on expedia. The fridge not even stocked with beer just one little bottle of rum which wasn鈥檛 even brugal. the room service..... the menu is limited and small, but in english. Being VIP we were suppose to call the VIP number to get room service. when you call the VIP concierge they tell you to call room service. Of course we complained to hotel management because the VIP concierges are pretty much useless and incompetent. I had sun glasses stolen from the VIP pool bar by the bartender most likely. My girlfriend had a 100 dollar bill stolen from her purse from the maid most likely. The good the hotel management gave us 200 cash and half our next vacation to any sol melia resort. I feel terrible my last vacation to the Caribbean was to a 5 star ritz carlton hotel in Jamaica and it was 50 times better then this garbage. This was my girlfriends 1st vacation to the carribean and a lot of money was invested to make this just a great experience. I wish some one from Sol Melia would contact me. 50% off and 200 dollars isn鈥檛 enough to compensate me on this nightmare of an experience. Like a friend of mine said to me today what did you expect from DR. Don鈥檛 get me wrong the resort was beautiful and well taken care of. Sol Melia needs to fix the numerous issues at this resort. It is no where near a 4 1/2 star resort. Take my honest word.

<Content>Paradise Lost ReviewLet me start by saying that this review will be fair and was done without any bias based on our experience. My wife and I travel frequently and have a fair amount of international travel under our belts. I hope that this and the other review will help you when trying to chose a resort.The resort is stunning and is truly paradise. This was our first trip to the Dominican and we would return to the island again in the future. The resort was very well manicured and the staff truly strives to make the guests feel at home when they have the opportunity. They take pride in their resort. That being said I think we just chose the wrong week for our trip. I would not recommend the week of Spring Break (April 17 鈥?22) for your stay. This was the week following Easter and the resort was full or over capacity. The other resorts surrounding Paradisus did not appear to be as full as this based on our walks on the beach. The service overall was less then expected. I do think again that this was attributed to how over booked the resort was and they could not accommodate all of the guests in a manner they had previously been known for. One of the main reasons we chose this resort was the glowing reviews from previous guests. I spoke to some repeat guests and they had a significantly different experience in the previous year and mentioned that the resort had sent a lot of the better staff to the new Palma Royale resort they just opened in December 2005 up the beach. My overall rating of this resort based on our stay and experiences of our stay would have to be a B-. When you pay for an all inclusive 4.5 star resort you expect near perfection and pampering. The biggest concern for the week should be if you put on enough sunscreen and what kind of tropical drink to order, not whether you can actually use the activities and services you paid for.RestaurantsThe meals were average and not what we had expected from a 4.5 star resort. Our expectations were what you would find on a cruise and not in your every day restaurants in the US. The food did lack the flavor and the spice you would expect of typical Caribbean dishes. Although you only were required to have a reservation for the Japanese and the French restaurant, during our stay all of the dinner meals required a reservation. We were lucky enough to get to try all of the different restaurants of our choice at least once during our stay. The staff at the Royal Service lounge did come through on this and due to a cancellation got us a reservation at the much coveted French restaurant. Long pants are a required for all restaurants at night.飪楲a Albufera (Steak House)oGrade:B-oReview: The restaurant was similar to several US steak restaurant chains. They offered 8 different main courses including steak, turkey, fish and pork.飪楨l Romantico (French)oGrade: A-oReview: This was the best food we had on our vacation. The service was outstanding and the food had great flavor. This was a change from the other food that we experienced while at the resort. The restaurant offered 5 or 6 entr茅es and delicious desserts. 飪楳arino (Seafood)oGrade: CoReview: This was our least favorite of the restaurants we tried. Being from Maine and having access to most all seafood, this did not live up to our expectations. The fish was dry and lacked flavor. 飪楧olce Vita (Italian)oGrade: BoReview: This restaurant serves both lunch and dinner so it served multiple roles for our stay. For lunch it offered several good pasta dishes and pizza. The provide take out options to take to the beach which is a big plus.飪楻adizo (Brazilian)oGrade: BoReview: This restaurant was a typical churrascaria like you find in many larger US cities. It offered table side service of steak, turkey, pork, lamb, sausage and chicken all rotisserie grilled. Some of the meat was a little over cooked but all had good flavor.飪楲a Palapa Grill (Lunch)oGrade: B+oReview: This is a buffet style restaurant that offered numerous foods, from local fresh grilled fish, cook to order pasta, grilled steak, lamb, pork, fresh fruits, cheese and breads, and hamburgers and hotdogs.飪楬ybiscus (Breakfast / Lunch)oGrade: B-oReview: This is a buffet style restaurant that offered numerous foods, from local fresh grilled fish, cook to order pasta, grilled steak, lamb, pork, fresh fruits, cheese and breads.飪榁IP Lounge (Breakfast)oGrade: B+oReview: This restaurant is only accessible to the Royal Service guests. It provides an air conditioned private dining area that has made to order eggs, fresh local fruit, cheeses, breads, juices, coffee and cappuccino. Room ServiceWe used room service several of the days during our stay. They had a limited but good menu and always delivered in a timely manner. The champagne was always cold, but the food was served cold on the occasion that we ordered a warm meal.Royal ServiceWe paid the additional fees to get the 鈥淩oyal Service鈥? This was supposed to provide several additional services to pamper the guests. Unfortunately we found this to less then royal and provided no additional service over the standard paying guests. I do believe this was a function of the resort being over booked for the week of our stay. I am not trying to make excuses for the lack of service. Believe me, when you pay hard earned money for something you expect to get it.We were supposed to have a Concierge / Butler for our stay and the only time we saw him was on the day we checked in when he transported our bags to our room that was not ready on check-in at 3pm. The other staff at the VIP Lounge did try hard to accommodate the quests, in spite of the tremendous scrutiny from the other US guests that were very unhappy with the service.ActivitiesThis was probably the biggest disappointment of our stay. One of the benefits of an all inclusive resort are the activities both water and land. Due to how overbooked the resort was, we were limited to a waiting list for all of the land and water activities. One would expect that over an entire week, you would be able to take part in the services that you paid for. When we arrived on Monday and tried to schedule our activities for the coming week, everything was booked already. Finally, later in the week, due to no shows, we were able to get a snorkel excursion to a coral reef, which was well worth it, and a boat excursion to the ship wreck 鈥淎stron鈥? I heard stories from other guests that pre booked activities well in advance of the stay and there reservations were not upheld. I can only speak for our experiences and really feel that the resort failed its guests severely in this area. They should know their capacity and the services that will support that capacity. We were never able to get a reservation for horseback riding or the other more desirable land activities.RoomThe room was a very nice, king Jr. suite, exactly as described. The building we were put in was #31, which was only the second building close to the beach. I would recommend building #19 or #25 if you have the choice. The second floor provides an exceptional view of the ocean. The only drawback to our room was the A/C would not get the room colder than 73 degrees. This was not a real issue since we spent the days at the beach and the nights having fun. DrinksThe drinks were average. The tropical drinks were made of pre mixed flavors versus fresh fruit you would have expected from a higher class resort. They did use local Dominican rum when requested. The wine and Champagne was all from Chile and was also average to above average in quality. The only beer they serve is Presedente.Night LifeThe night life was fairly good. Each night provided some sort of Vegas type show to entertain the guests.

<Content>Believe the poor reviews! This was the worse trip I have ever been on. Besides the fact that it rained for two days straight (not the hotels fault) But I am still washing our clothes (2-3 times) to get the smell out. The rooms were musty and damp. The hotel is so spread out you can't easily get around. The food is AWFUL. If you are used to having first class service, this is not the place. They definitely do not know who their customer is. We felt several times like we were bothering them. If you are not used to seeing old women topless and old men in speedos, don't go to the beach. Someone even said they saw a totally nude man on the beach. Now I remember why I don't like all-inclusive resorts. I was not impressed with the island overall. The people at the airport were like vultures and aggressive. There are far better islands to visit. What a disappointment!

<Content>The Most Perfect Vacation! My boyfriend and I just returned from the Paradisus and I could not wait to write this review. I just read the review above and was absolutely shocked. I feel very very sorry for the person who wrote it. If they did not LOVE this resort, there is no place on earth they will enjoy..so sad.The resort was absolutely incredible. Lush gardens, elegantly decorated common areas, and AMAZING restaurants. The food was TERRIFIC. Plenty of it and all sorts of variety. Our room was one of the Royal Service suites and it was incredibly well maintained and clean... and I am a clean freak! While the staff does not speak English much (how arrogant of someone to think its mandatory to speak English in a country whose language is Spanish!!), they made incredible efforts to understand our requests..we actually had a blast and a lot of laughs with them while we tried to understand each other. It was NEVER a big deal, at any time. We always got the drinks, food, etc we asked for. We did not pass one employee from the grounds keepers to the management that did not greet us with a smile and an HOLA! We had ordered room service (which was 24 hours) each day after the beach and got a cheese platter and a bottle of champagne, by the 2nd day we had done that, the staff just started stocking our mini bar with champagne..very thoughtful, no language problem there!I have been to SEVERAL all-inclusive resorts, including Sandals, and I will say,hands down, the Paradisus beat them all. As for the beach.. it was SPECTACULAR, wide, white sand, gorgeous turquoise water. There is so much beach, its nearly impossible to be crowded. The water wasn't that great for swimming, lots of large waves. Get a massage on the beach.. with the sounds of the water its wonderful!If asked, I am sure my boyfriend and I would say we had the MOST fun at the Pool Bar. What a blast!! Claudio, one of our favorite bartenders ROCKS!!! When you go.. try the mudslides and of course the Mamajuana (local Dominican drink which provides hours of fun and enjoyment!).All in all, it was an absolutely perfect vacation..I have traveled much of the US and Europe and I can easily and confidently recommend the Paradisus! In fact we will be going again next year and I heard there is a Paradisus in Costa Rica, which I would not HESITATE to try!Book it right now!! You will not regret it!

<Content>welcome to hell I recently stayed at The Paradisius and was begging my travel agent to get me out.Rooms are small dirty and dark, none of the staff speak English, the food is inedible and the beach is crowded and full of skanky half clad women. It is incidentally a public beach so the resort has no control.If you are going to the D.R. do yourself a favor and stay at Casa de Campo.

<Content>Awesome Vacation This was our first time to an inclusive and it was awesome. I don't know how anyone can write a negative review about this resort. The hotel employees were very helpful and prompt. The food was very good with plenty of variety. All restaurants were fairly easy to get into with the steak and Mexican restaurants the best for us. Breakfast was great everyday with many different choices. Bar drinks were fine. Presidente beer tasted better early in the week, it's not primo.The beach is definitely incredible and the pool magnificent. Activities were plentiful. My teenage and early 20s kids were never bored. SCUBA diving lessons were included and appeared well managed. The golf at COcotal was very good. Actually better than expected with no problem getting around in 4 1/2 hoursteeing off at 8:30.Off property excursions are pricey. Don't swim with the dolphins. Rather tacky and wastes a half day for 20 minutes in the water. However, the ATV excursion was awesome.We will definitely be back.

<Content>Royal Service not so Royal! Sorry to be long winded, but I need to say that there are far better resorts to accomodate you on your trip to Punta Cana. The Iberostar being one. The grounds are nice at the Paradisus, but still not quite as elegant and precisely maintained as the Iberostar. As far as service, upon check in we were told we had recieved an upgrade from standard service to royal service. I will not get into the whole story here, but basically after being transported a two miles to the VIP lounge to check in, we were treated horribly by Mariana, the VIP supervisor. She acted as though we were trying to scam the Royal Service without paying for it, when in fact all we had tried to do was check in for our standard room at the main reception. She then suggested we trek back to the main reception to check in. My in-laws had reserved and paid for the royal service for themselves, so they asked if she would inform them of what exactly that entailed. We were told it included an upgraded room (which I saw later that night and is basically a standard room with a canopy over the bed and a chaise lounge instead of a credenza in the living room area), access to the VIP lounge which has free internet service and access to the Royal beach area (basically a section of the beach which is roped off, with wait staff). My mother-in-law then asked if we could accompany them while they were in the royal beach area. There was only silence which we took as a big fat no! So, they did not get to enjoy the royal beach area that week. My brother-in-law waited all night to have his bag delivered to his room. He may not have ever gotten it if my mother-in-law hadn't noticed it (tagged with his room number on it) sitting outside the VIP lounge the next morning. She had to deliver it herself.As far as making reservations for the different restaurants goes, it was fine if you had the royal service. They would let you make them in advance for any restaurant. If you only had standard service you had to show up to the restaurant you were hoping to eat at and hope they could accomodate you. Otherwise, it was the buffet every night. Fortunately, my in-laws made reservations for every night so we ate well. The food was good compared to some resorts I've been to. However, the service was a little lacking. Several evenings of the week, one (more often two) of our party would order something off the menu and recieve something completely different. We always ate it or tried to. But forget trying to ask them what happened to what you really ordered. Perhaps they were just out of it and didn't bother to tell you. The same went for the drinks at the bar. After the second pina colada I ordered showed up red, I decided to stick to the beer and wine or rum and cokes. Perhaps it was because we weren't tipping the wait staff like crazy, but I beleive we did pay for all inclusive service. Anyway, that was the jist of it. We didn't tip so we didn't get served - at least not for the first 20 minutes we stood at the bar. Also, there was no beach bar. We found this a little disappointing, as far as in past vacations we were always able to walk up to the beach bar in our bathing suits and get a couple of beers or drinks in the afternoon. Not so at the Paradisus. You'd have to walk into the Hibiscus bar which is surrounded by all the restaurants and is a good distance from the beach.So, I don't recommend the Paradisus. If you're going to Punta Cana stay somewhere else, like the Iberostar. And be prepared for a stressful aiport experience, going and coming. The lines were horrendous. Make sure you get there at the very latest, two hours before your return flight. We had planned to do that, but a lot of the prearranged transfers get you there much later than that. Just be prepared to stand in line with a bunch of other irate people in a hurry. Needless to say, we will probably never return to Punta Cana. Feel free to e-mail me if you have questions.Oh, and if you dive the diving is included. A lot of times the weather is too rough to go out, so be prepared for that. We managed to get 5 dives in for the week only because we went on the excursion to Catalina Island which includes two dives. There really isn't much to see around the resort area anyway. If you've been to Mexico or Cozumel, you'll be disappointed in the sea life that's visible in Punta Cana.

<Content>Beautiful waters, perfect beach, but anything but Royal service The beach was beautiful and we had perfect weather so we were all anticipating having a great time after hearing positive recommendations about Paradisus. We booked into the Royal service which was at best frustratingly inconsistent. Poor English by most of the Royal Service receptionists lead to incorrect or totally wrong information about their own hotel. Towels that never came till 11pm at night after a request at 6pm, dinner reservations that were lost one night, never came for another , incorrect information on restaurant offerings, sometimes fresh towels , sometimes not, wake up call that never happened..so we have to say we will not recommend the extra money spent at getting the Unroyal Royal Service.The food was better than expected at most restaurants, better than most other Caribbean islands we had visited. Speaking Spanish would take one a long way since most staff understood minimal English.The grounds were pristine and well kept. The beach and waters were awesome.Would we do another Paradisus again ? We are not so sure - we didn't expect to be treated like royalty, but some little ounce of consistency would have made a difference.

<Content>great place to relax Look for my recommendation on who to buy paintings from.2 other couples went with us from the carolinas. We are in our early 30's. I speak Spanish but the other guys do not. All of us own hotels so this review is from someone in the industry. I used Orbitz to book this trip and I will never use them again for anything. My flight was messed up and the price different from original quote and transfer were not included. I read the reviews on this site after having booked my trip to Punta Cana. I therefore didn't know what to expect on this trip.Getting to the resort you can take the bus or a taxi. Cab costed us 25. It didn't take long to get there.As for the rooms, they were large and the bed was comfortable. The shower pressure wasn't that good if you used it while people in other rooms around you used it. Maid service was great. Don't expect everything to be perfect in the rooms, it is not a franchised property.The grounds were well maintained. The shuttle was always available for us lazy people. Don't believe the distances, it doesn't take long to walk anywhere on the property.Pool towels were a hot commodity while we were there. The place wasn't full but they had run out. Doesn't make sense, but whatever.The Spa - We spent some time there in the hot tub and getting massages and facials. They have a workout facility there but why do that while on vacation.Shopping - We went to a couple of shops and most were rip offs. We finally found one guy that we could haggle with. I walked away with a painting for half the price of other vendors' best price. His name is Jean Mackenton and his number is [------------]. The address on his card is D'Arca Plaza local #16. Someone should know how to get there. It's a short walk from the resort. He's a good guy. His mother works as a nanny in NY and he speaks decent English. He is a Haitian.Food. We heard that you need reservations for a lot of restaurants. this is true on some nights and others it is not. Also if it is packed you can slip the front guy a 20 and you'll get a seat. Brazilian - We went there late and the food was overcooked. We met some other people who went there early and their food was undercooked. Try and get there around 8:00.Chinese - Really good food and the nicest staff. I am not the biggest fan of Chinese but we went there twice becase it was good.Italian - Eat the Sea Bass - the best thing they have there. The pizza is alright - but at 2 in the morning when you're drunk it tastes like heaven.Seafood - Best thing there is the whole fish. We had it for lunch and it was great. The other stuff was alright - buffet food.French - The lamb there was good. Small portions though.American - Did not like the cuts and would not recommend.Japanese - Food was decent. Ambience was great. We sat with some northerners and they were good company.Alcohol - flows freely but they only have one beer. Had to switch to liquor.Gaming - There'e a casino on property and a better one right outside the resort. The dealers at both places were ruthless. The Roulette was very kind to all who played. Your experience may vary.Beach was nice and so was the pool even though it closed early.The other two guys got bad runs and vomiting. Nothing happened to me though. I guess some may get affected and others not. Good luck on this one.I would go back again with the right company, if I were to go to Punta Cana.

<Content>A very good experience, would return My husband and I stayed at the Paradisus March 11-15th. We are late 30's/early 40's. This resort was recommended by my parents who have been there multiple times. Their advice on room numbers to request and tipping probably helped our first experience there. Beach: beautiful, Paradisus is on the best part of it. Plenty of chairs. Wind was light and warm, waves fun.Staff: bartenders and restaurant managers were friendly and enjoyable. Maid: ok, probably should have tipped better the first night instead of waiting until the end of the stay. The room was clean, no bugs seen.Towels: a pain... bring an extra beach towel of your own.Pool: did not enjoy the lounge chair competition, preferred the beach until happy hour when the pool area was cooler, and more chairs were available.Other people: enjoyed the variety of ages and nationalities. Met some friendly couples who were ending their visit at the beginning of ours... would have enjoyed a few more days overlap!Nightlife: it is what you make it, we enjoyed the lobby bar after dinner, and had fun Salsa dancing with the show staff.Food: good variety, great atmosphere in the many restaurants, ok quality. It's not the US, remember we are used to the best. Overall, it was good enough, some dishes better than others (my favorite was the shrimp app. at the seafood restaurant, and the fillet at the French.)Overall: beautiful grounds, pool/beach/lunch and restaurants all close by, friendly place. I don't speak Spanish, but found when I tried anyway, they tried English back, and smiles were plentiful. When in Punta Cana, do as the Dominicans...I can't wait to go back.

<Content>MY CHILDREN ARE SPOILED AND LOVED THIS PLACE! We are a very spoiled family of five from Long Island , New York. We are all seasoned travelers. We LOVE this place. The service, food, beach, shows, just the total package is good. Better then good, great. The inclusive room service is a big plus. The shows are diverse and creative, lots of evergy, these performers truly want to please you. We enjoyed reinactiong the dance numbers nightly in our spacious, clean room over late night snacks. Good stuff. Quality time with the kids, but sometimes we don't like the kids so much and there is plenty of space to get lost here. The kiddies did'nt mind at all, they were very busy with all the childrens activities provided. I must make mention of the superb dinner that was prepared for us at El Romantico on Christmas eve. El delicious! You will not worry about losing weight here, not happening. (I'm still craving the lobster appy at the chineese place.)The walk to the well equipped health club will help. (skip the trolly ride) My kids are begging to go back, I'm using this hotel for bribes for good grades, working like a charm. I miss riding the trolleys at night, enjoying the sounds of music fronm the lobby and beach, and the the breathtaking beauty of this fabulous resort. by the way, you know how us New Yorkers love our coffee, the coffee is really good, and when I craved a quiet time with a cup in my room, the room service was super polite and for coffee quick is good, and boy are they quick. This Hotel will make you smile.

<Content>royal service yes-loved the paradisus We loved the Paradisus-we did the royal service and would do it again. We are in are our early thirties and frequent all-inclusives so we can eat, drink, and relax on the beach. We had a tough time choosing a hotel, most hotels in DR get very mixed reviews. We had just stayed at Secrets Excellence in Riviera Maya last May and loved it but all the Secrets are the same-alot of concrete and we wanted something different. We were due for a pleasant surprise after a very disappointing trip to the overrated Grand Lido Braco last july. Paradisus Punta Cana was just that--a very nice surprise. We had a great room (no bugs)a few steps from the beach.We liked the royal service beach which had nice chairs, umbrellas, and waiter service. The grounds are beautiful-you feel like you are in the carribean not a man-made concrete resort like Secrets.The food was good but not consistent. You could eat horrible food here depending on what you ordered. I did my homework on trip advisor so we did pretty well. The best restaurant by far was the chinese. Also room service was surprisingly wonderful-shrimp cocktail, filet, and creme caramel. for lunch sea bass at the italian rest or burgers by the pool. Pizza for a late night snack.Plus they always had our wine selection at dinner.I think what we really liked about this place was the night life. we go to alot of all inclusives and this is what stood out for me. At night the lobby bar was hopping with people hanging out and a live band. And the casino was full but not crowded. Most all inclusives everyone is in bed by 10pm and the resort shuts down-not here. I can see how the place gets mixed reviews. For the price we loved it but we had a great room, no bugs, we ordered well, won at the casino, and met some really fun couples!!! If you don't get away that much Secrects is a safe bet but..if you want to try something different....

<Content>Don't belive everything you read! A group of friends and I decided to be pampered for a week in Punta Cana. We did all of the research and picked La Paradisus. Just about 2 weeks before going, my sister turned me on to this site. The reviews were mixed opinions and words of advise. After reading the reviews, I was a little bit concerned because excellent service is important to me and my group (we're spoiled!). The reviews were filled with complaints about service, food, and the room. At this point there was nothing my group could do except hope for the best. The other trend that I noticed with the reviews, was that the Americans, especially from the northern states, had the most complaints. The reviews from Canada, Europe, and South America were excellent.Our experience...There were about 4 situations that required more energy and patience than we wanted to use on a vacation. 2 of the 4 were customs in both countries, and let me tell you that Miami was the worst! They were disorganized and time consuming. Not the hotel's fault by any means.We did have one not so yummy meal during our 1 week stay, and it was at the Japanese restaurant. We didn't have expectations, but wanted to try it ourselves.The last problem was that there was a towel shortage over the weekend. They got very busy and ran out of towels. This really upset the folks from the northern part of the US. They would stand in front of the towel booth where you get the beach towels, and just carry on. It was embarrassing. I did go to management and say something, and within 15 minutes I had towels in my hand and in my room.All in all, none of that was a big deal.Our room and the grounds are exactly like the pictures. Although room service and bell hops were not as quick as other places, they did just fine. The area has only been developed for less than 10 years.We all thought the food and drinks were Terrific! The drinks were actually a bit too strong on occassion. The wine was excellent and available. The alcohol was not substandard. I had Absolut in all of my vodka drinks.The helpful things that I got from this site is that it is helpful to at least try to speak spanish. I think they took care of us because I sounded so pitiful at times. I was the only one in our group that spoke spanish, and the rest received great service and attention as well.The part about $100 in singles was helpful too. A dollar goes a LONG way.I would recommend this resort, and will go back again.

<Content>love Love LOVE Ok, this is the second time that I went to this hotel. I was there the last time in April 2003. I must say that this trip was as good if not better then the first!! For first time travelers to Punta Cana, it's true.... getting from the airport to the hotel seems a little sketchball at first but I've traveled both times with apple vacations and I've gotten to and from the hotel no problem. Make sure that when you are in the airport you don't let any of the men on the way out carry your bags. You won't get them back until you pay them. If you are traveling with a tour company just drag your bags out of the exit of the airport and before you get to the parking lot in the back you will see tour stands where you will meet your tour group representative. I think next time I go down I'll probably just fly down on my own and take a taxi to the hotel but I would say for first time travelers a tour group makes you feel more comfortable. I can't say enough positive things about the hotel. The grounds are just gorgeous. It's a nice, scenic walk from the bungalows by the pool and beach to the lobby on palm tree shaded pathways. The bungalows have about eight rooms on each side. Four downstairs and four upstairs. The rooms whether you are in one of the suites or standard rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated. The maids put flowers on the sink when they clean the rooms and that's why there are sometimes little tiny ants on the counter. If you throw out the flowers the little ants go away. There is a balcony off each room. Most have very nice views of the beautiful landscaping. All the rooms are very quiet and the air conditioning keeps them very comfortable compared to the warm dominican sun. There's a mini bar in the room and along with everything else at the resort it's all inclusive. There are about 8 restaurants on the premesis. I thought the food was awesome. There's Chinese, French, Brazilian, Mexican, Japanese, Seafood, Buffets, a Steakhouse, and an Italian Restaurant. The French Restaurant requires reservations which can be made at the breakfast buffet area. You'll need long pants if you are a man at some of the restaurants. The Brazilian restaurant is a lot of fun because they bring out several different types of meat on a sword and cut off your piece for you. You can sit out over the water that's around the Italian Restaurant if you request one of those tables. The Chinese Restaurant is beautifully located near the pool which was a lovely focal point while eating. At the Japanese restaurant they prepare the food in front of you. You also have to make reservations for that restaurant. The only restaurant that I wasn't thrilled with was the Seafood restaurant on the beach at night. It seemed like our food was precooked and they just zapped it for us before bringing it out. But at lunch that restaurant was great. All the drinks are included. EVERYTHING is included. Wines at dinner, bar drinks, pop... everything is included. I was a little unhappy to see that people were tipping the bartenders this time when I was there. The first time I was there the staff would not accept tips but it seems that things have changed a bit. I did not tip and still recieved great, friendly service. There are shows in the lobby at night. The dancers are fantastic. Ok it's not broadway quality but that's not what I would expect at a Caribbean resort. They are still very entertaining and fun to watch. If you don't think so, there's a bar right behind the theater.... go get another drink. The beach here is GORGEOUS. Even out of all the hotels on Punta Cana I would say that Paradisus has a particularly good stretch of beach. Sometimes the waves are big enough to boogie board too. All the non motorized water sports are included (sailing, Boogie Boards, Scuba Diving, Snorkling, Windsurfing, etc.). If you like to play golf there is a free course (but you have to rent a cart... I think it was 33 dolars a person). That course however is just ok. There is another course that is right on the ocean and is beautiful to play on but I think that one was 150 a person. If you want to play tennis it's free once again. The courts are clay and are kept in great condition. If you want to workout you can do that for free. There are ellipticals, bikes, a treadmill, some free weights and a full spinning class room. There's a spa if you want to get a manicure or a massage or whatever. There's a little massage hut by the pool too. The same girls give the massages there but it's a little cheaper then having it done at the actual spa (30 dollars 30 minutes, 60 dollars 60 minutes). There are flea markets both ways down the beach. Have fun haggling!! I love to do it. The pool is HUGE at the hotel. There's pool volleyball and a swim up bar. It doesn't ever get deeper then about 5 feet and there are some shallower parts for the little ones. The service is fantastic at the hotel. Everyone is lovely and there is a very laid back attitude that I LOVE. If you want something done it will get done. The only thing I will say as a word of caution is that the last time I was at the hotel I was with my then boyfriend. I was never approached by anyone. This time I was there I was single and the native Dominicans have no problem approaching you to tell you how beautiful you are. Mostly it was no big deal but once and a while it was a little uncomfortable. I never felt like my safety was at risk or anything to that caliber, I just don't really like being held up by people to be hit on. Overall once again I had a FANTASTIC time!!! I'll be back again soon I'm sure.

<Content>Ultra-fabulous - Best in the D.R. My husband and I stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana from December 3-10, 2005. The following is a summary our experiences and impressions of the resort and nearby areas.ABOUT US: My husband is 33 and I am 32. We have been married 1 year, no kids, and are members of the Palace Premier Club, which we joined in 2004 at the Aventura Palace. My husband is a self-employed small business owner and I am an attorney. Both of us have traveled extensively for work and pleasure to places including Hawaii (15+ times), Mexico (Cancun, PV, Mazatlan), Canada, Dominican Republic, Europe, and 49 of the 50 states. We live in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a 鈥渓uxury snob鈥?while my husband is a Motel 6 kind of guy. THE HOTEL: Oh my gosh. It is beautiful from the time that you walk into check in. I never give anywhere 5 stars, because I'm pretty picky, but this property deserves it. There is a lobby bar where people can congregate. Presidente in the bottle and on tap. Check in went pretty fast. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous. You walk on a causeway through a lagoon to get to the rest of the hotel. There is a shuttle bus that goes all around picking and dropping off people so that you don鈥檛 have to walk too far if you don鈥檛 want to. There is an internet terminal in the lobby which costs $5 for 30 minutes. There is no Jacuzzi, only a pool, but a nice pool, at that.THE OTHER GUESTS: Unlike other locations in the Dominican, Punta Cana, and this resort in general, appeared to be about 50% Americans and 50% European or other.THE ROOMS: Our room was on the second floor. There are no elevators, which is okay if you are able to go up and down stairs. If not, request a main floor room. Our room was not as nice as the rest of the hotel but still okay. The thing I thought was weird was that there was no dresser or armoire to put clothes. Just a closet. We were not in the Royal Club. I heard Royal Club was much nicer. If you like to read on your balcony at night, take a flashlight. There are no outdoor lights on the balconies.THE FOOD: They have about 8 different restaurants and the only one we missed was El Romantico. Oh, and the Japanese place. Make your reservations the first day (can be done in the restaurant pavilion) because they fill up fast. We waited until the 4th day of a 7 day trip and could not get in. It wasn鈥檛 a big deal simply because even the buffets are great.THE DRINKS: Just as good as anywhere else, but when you are in the Dominican, you only need to know two words 鈥?El Presidente.THE SERVICE: As anywhere else, a little bit of a nice attitude goes a long way. I never had any problems with anyone being rude or unhelpful to me. I brought lots of $1s and $5s for tipping. People do not speak English here like in Mexico, but they speak more English here than any other part of the DR that I've been to. One thing, though, is that any attempt by an American to speak Spanish will be much appreciated.THE BEACH: The beach is very beautiful, lots of clean white sand. The staff does not serve drinks out at the beach which you may be used to from other AIs. No big deal. They have a beach hut where you can get drinks.THE ACTIVITIES: They have an animation team at the pool and beach that keeps activities going all afternoon long. They have bingo, a guessing game, dance lessons, water aerobics, etc.THE DIVING: We went diving for two days. Right before our arrival there had been a big storm, and the visibility was 15-20 feet, pretty low for Caribbean diving. Also, the reef is not protected like on the south side of the island. If you really like to dive, and want to make that a focal point of your trip, I suggest staying in Bayahibe. Diving is included at the Paradisus Punta Cana.THE SPA: The spa has great packages that seemed to be fairly priced. They are the same prices that you would pay in the U.S and in U.S. dollars. The spa fills up with noisy Europeans at about 4pm who are there to use the plunge pools, so be forewarned. If you like peace and quiet, go early. THE TOURS: We did the Jeep Safari for $85 per person. It was pretty fun! Email me if you want more info. There are 4 people to a jeep so try to get a fun couple to go with if you are not a foursome. Otherwise you can get stuck with someone not fun or who speaks a different language.THE GIFT SHOP: The gift shop was nice but way, WAY overpriced. You can walk outside the gate and down just a few blocks to Plaza Bavaro and save a lot of money if you don鈥檛 mind the heckling from the vendors. They are worse than Tijuana.IN CONCLUSION: Thumbs up for this lovely resort 鈥?the staff is great, the location is beautiful, and the food is great (best at any of the 8 AI resorts that I have been to). And did I mention the Presidente? Contact me for more info!

<Content>Not what expected for the price The Dominican Republic is a beautiful country to visit, however the Paradisus needs to make some adjustments before I ever go back. The resort itself is not the problem. It is the Royal Service that the club offers. It is way overrated. You do not get what you pay for. We never heard from our butler except for the first day that we arrived. All our information about the area came from an employee that we ran into in the front lobby named Miguel. This is what the butler was supposed to do. If it had not been for him, we would not have known which restuarants to eat in and what time you could even go there. The times we called for our butler he never called back or they would tell us he was not there. We never spoke to him beyond the first day. They also tell you that when you have Royal Service you can call them for Room Service. This is a joke. Every time we called VIP, we were told to call Room Service. We also had to stay on the fartherest side of the Resort. The private beach area was on the opposite side. We found that it was easier to stay on the side that our room was on. The reason for this is because the resort is in the process of building the private pool for VIP. This meant that they had the area blocked off that lead to the private beach. You had to then walk the long way around and then go back to the beach area. We did go to the private beach area once needless to say we did not go back for the above reason but also because the service you get is nonexistant. They came around once and asked us what we wanted to drink. Plus anyone had access to this beach. The only difference between the two beach areas were the chairs in the private beach area were more comfortable. Overall the beach was clean and well kept. The reservations that are made for you at the restuarants, you can make yourself. You do not need them to make this for you.Our butler also did not inform us about the pillow menu. We did not find the form for this until 10 minutes before check out. Also we were not told anywhere by anyone that if you make a credit card call or a calling card call from your room, you will be charged 60 pesos per call for a connection fee. This can add up in a hurry especially when you are unaware of this charge. By the way, if anyone has horseback riding experience, I recommend skipping this part of the excursions that are included in the price. The reason is because if you have any experience you will find the excursion lacking. Most, except for about 2, of the horses are nags and in very poor condition. They never get beyond the back-beating trot. I have rode horses for 30 years and this was the most excurciating experience of my life. My horse liked to have beat me to death and they are like a bunch of pack mules. We also had to go to several other resorts to pick up people to go riding also. Our trip was supposed to take 1 hour and it ended up taking 3 hours. I would also like to tell anyone not to use Future Vacations who uses Club Caribe as their representative. We were 4 women, who doesn't speak any Spanish, traveling alone and nobody showed up at the airport to pick us up. This was a little nerve racking. They never were at the hotel when they were supposed to be. We never seen our representative with Club Caribe except for the day after we arrived and was told that he would take care of everything. We called him every day thereafter and he never showed up to meet with us like he scheduled. We were not able to book any excursions nor do any activities trying to meet up with him to confirm our flight. For example, we had an excursion for snorkeling that is included in the price scheduled for Saturday and our representative said that he could meet with us between 10:30 am and 11:30 am, so we cancelled our snorkeling trip (which was our last day) to meet with this person and he never showed. The night before we left he told us on the phone that we just needed to take a taxi. We had the resort call for a taxi and we arrived at the airport on time.

<Content>Gorgeous Resort I surprised my husband for our 20th year anniversary by taking him along with two other couples with us to the Paradisus Punta Cana. We had a great time overall.  My husband loved it so much that he wants to go back again next year despite some minor inconveniences.  The grounds are absolutely gorgeous!!! Loved it, and will definitely miss them.  We all had a room in the royal service, which we decided that we would have been fine without. You have the service, but really didn't need all the amenities nor did we seem to get the royal kiss your butt service that we thought we would get--even after tipping generously. That's another thing, we decided that its not worth the tipping to anyone except maybe the bartenders on the beach. No one else seemed to appreciate it, we paid a lot to stay there, with maybe only an okay satisfactory report on the service in general. The restaraunts were a little better with their services, but was definitely disgusted when one of the waiters turned to blow out her nostrils then finished pouring our wine--we were seated outside.  We all had rooms on the beach. Joyce and Dan's room had a cockroach found both in their bed crawling on her in the middle of the night, and also on their television table. They had trouble with their water--getting any to come out, or to be warm enough when it did. They also complained about the wind rattling the window doors so loudly at night that it was hard to sleep. There were a few cats seen on premises, and unfortunately, there was a cat fight in the middle of the night, making it hard to sleep through that. They were also woken up by the construction noise from the new royal service only pool and bar being put in. Despite the things that happened with their room, I thought they had a gorgeous view of the beach.  Julie and Aaron's room--same thing with their room as far as the cockroaches, water, and construction goes. I might add that they were all in building 19, so maybe it was just the building. They said that they heard the maids chatting up a storm so early in the morning that it woke them up.  We didn't have any problems in building 1 except we got the construction view instead of the beach because they are renovating the area by putting in a royal service only pool area and bar. I would love to come back to the hotel to see that when it is finished. We were told that it should be completed around March 16th, 2006, which is right around the corner. If the walls weren't up for the construction we would have had an awesome view.  We found overall that the grounds are absolutely gorgeous, the staff average, the food at some restaraunts were great while others were just okay. Some of the desserts were just terrible, while others were great. I wanted so much to not have any negative things to say, but you have to be realistic. We were in the Dominican and I think with both the language barrier and service will come around in a much better way in the next few years. We were told that they are trying to get schools for the staff to learn english, and also to learn it better. I had a hard time understanding most with their thick english accent. Yes, we would go back, and, yes, I would get the royal service again so that I could enjoy the new royal pool--that would have been worth it, then.  Hope this helps, and sorry the review is so long, but all needed to be said. Lisa and Michael

<Content>Fan-Freaking-Tastic Best beach, pool is realy nice, food great. You can't expect everyone in the world to speak english. Lots of French folks. Will be going back again and again. A few US$ bucks as tips goes a long way. Everyone freindly. Lots of topless women and man thongs so be open minded and respectful of other cultures please (don't stare). Remember you are representing the us down there. Walking is good for you so enjoy it, bring good walking shoes. Get round trip transportaion to and from the airport prior to going.

<Content>Great Place for those who love the Beach We are a group of 8 Seniors and we take a week's vacation every February. We have been to Punta Cana before and stayed at Secrets, which we loved but every year we try another resort. Paradisus is 10 years old and will undergo renovation soon. The beach is beautiful and there was no problem with the lounges. They have enough, which is not always the case with other resorts. Remember this is the Atlantic Ocean, so the water was rough. You have to go out beyond the breaking waves to enjoy the water. The pool was beautiful, but too many kids for us. The restaurants were wonderful and the service was terrific. The liquor was top shelf and their martinis were always perfect. Only one complaint; the tub/shower is very narrow and the shower curtain just sticks to you. There was no shower massage either, but after the renovation that problem should disappear. The guys went golfing at the nearby Tropical (free green fees) and we all had a great time.

<Content>Stay Away!! We were at Paradisus Punta Cana from March 1 to March 5,2006---If I had to stay any longer I would have lost my mind. Actually, I tried to switch to another hotel after breakfast on our second day, but they were full. I can make a few positive comments about paradisus,the casino was nice, the beach was beautiful, the Japanese Restaurant was delicious but otherwise this was THE WORST resort I have ever stayed at anywhere. Let me preface my comments by the fact that we were in the Dominican Republic in February from the 2nd thru the 9th and could not wait to go back! We had stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro Suites on that trip. I will try to be specific in my criticisms and comments.  My first impression upon driving up was that the resort was tired. I quickly changed that to rundown and neglected Everything was overgrown, none of the landscaping was maintained; what should have been flowering shrubs were only green, since nothing had been done to them. The lawns were not maintained. People had cut paths across the property and nothing had been done to correct them.No one removed any debris from shrubery or lawns. I did not see one person working on the grounds during the five days that we were there--either cleaning or maintenance--with the exception of a worker painting a bridge with oil-based paint at 10AM making the entire lobby uninhabitable due to the fumes.!!! The trees outside our Royal Service Room were #2271 were touching the building, coming into the terrace, and making the room dark. It was like being in a Tropical rain forest, dark, and dreary. The room was basically clean, but someting I have never seen was here....Our bathroom had no doors it was on the left as you enter the room, and then there were swinging shutters (about three feet high) separating the toilet area. The linens were thin and shabby.Garbage and Cigarettes were left in the containers along the paths. We were walking on the beach by seven....The beach was cleared of seaweed, etc. and then those giant black garbage bags were left at the entrances to the beach all day....You found yourself walking past trash bags at four in the afternoon.. The feet washers leaving the beach didn't work...you wound up going to lunch or back to your room with sandy feet. Some days, there werer no towels, someone took one of ours, and when we went to happy hour at the pool, a guest overheard us, and told us that they had to steal towels all week from other guests!!--they tol us how to do it when they were left unattended --CLassy NO? Half of the beach chairs were broken....no back supports, and ALL of them were sagging and old, and dirty. There was no waiter service on the regular beach...more to come on that.The buffets were a nauseating experience. The food selection was very limited, nothing was marked, and you were greeted by raw pork on ice, and raw fish..The presentation was awful, nothing was hot. Now, I know this will sound unbelievable, but it truly happened: I went to take a piece of french toast from one of the steam tables, When the tongs made contact with the tray, I got an electric shock!!! I called the hostess, she tried the same thing, and SHE got an electic shock! solution? There was a conference with some workers, and they unplugged the tray without a word to me. THere was one stone-faced chef making omeletes. Behind him is a giant garbage pail, and a dirty rusted pole.The air-conditioned area at the other buffet had the same greasy hand prints on the glass for two days---one being a child's print at knee height and another a full man's hand print at eye level... These with assorted greasy smudges ...What does this tell you?After my electrocution I had had enough, and went to the general manager...Mr. Castillo. I enumerated my complaints to him, telling him I would have been gone to Iberostar Bavaro, if they had any rooms...He upgraded us to Royal Service for the remainder of our trip, somewhat better, but in my estimation, not worth it.. We were moved to a different section of the beach with nice beachchairs, and there was wait service in this section. However, it was such a small section, that people were right on top of each other.I sat next to a family who came with a cooler bag, and Lays potatoe chips---and listened to the Mom's concerns about her daughter's diaper exploding in the water...This was all done in a scream. Most of the guests were Americans, and there were a good number of screaming kids. Royal Service has a separate breakfast room, a nice curtained enclosed room, which again served a limited buffet. I do not go to the Carribean to eat breakfast indoors though, I could have stayed in NY for that!! Royal Service and we had to flag down the waiter for coffee! and the milk was bad!! YOu can't make it up!! Royal Service did make our dinner reservations, and Liz in that section was ever so nice. We did not get the promised newspaper in the morning. I don't want anyone to unpack my bags-- one of the services included, and I would not get into the room jacuzzi, which they would fix for you. Royal Service costs $70 per person per nite more, While nice, definitely not worth it, since many of the things you receive are just regular service in other hotels. And now to top it off, when we were leaving, the Cart carrying us and our bags broke down in the middle of the property on the way back to meet our bus!! The driver had to flag someone down,transfer our bags, push the one trolly off the path, and we just made our departure bus!! You couldn't make it up!!!Having been to the Dominican Republic twice before, I find this hotel to be an extremely bad representation of the Dominican People. My impression was that the people working at the resort seemed --in general--unhappy. The number of really pleasant people could be noted. My impression was that the resot might be closing, the manager, Mr. Castillo said no, they were doing a seven million dollar addition, new pool, beach club for royal service, I suggested that they put some money in general maintenance and service. Do not go here!!! Questions? zvago@yahoo.com

<Content>Great time We booked through CheapCarribean(--) and got a great deal for 5 days and 4 nights at the end of Feb 2006. The room was nice and comfortable. They are all suites, so you get a small fridge (stocked with drinks), two couches, and a patio with an awesome view (doesn't matter where you are!). The beds are a little hard but we didn't notice because we ran around all day and were beat by the end of the night.The beach was beautiful, just like you see in postcards and ads. Local vendors were not a problem, but the staff at the resort were a little bothersome about their adventure packages. The pool was all you could want - massive - with a pool bar with friendly waitstaff. The pool also has a snack bar behind the pool bar where you can get hot dogs, hamburgers, and chicken sandwiches throughout the day. Susana was the lady that made them for us each day; she was always friendly and quick. The restaurants were pretty incredible by all-inclusive standards. I drank the water every day and never had a problem. (Maybe I'm lucky, but I asked a waitress for bottled water and she assured me the water from the pitcher was purified...) We got reservations for Le Romantica and Dolce Vita; we also ate at the Mexican restaurant and the Chinese place. Everything we ate was delicious, from appetizers to dessert. Our favorite was the Mexican restaurant, but they were all great - service and food. The buffet was what you'd expect I think; we only ate there for breakfast, so I can't say much. What we had there was great though... We didn't buy transfers from the airport so we had to catch a cab from and to the airport, but we had no problems getting one (it was $25 each way for 2 people). It's probably an hour ride, depending on who is driving. Some tips...- Take $100 or $200 in singles like everyone says. We got lazy the day before we left and neglected to get them... We scrounged around all week for ones and fives... Everyone needs them so no one has them. It's worth it to tip, even if you go to the buffet. These people work very hard and deserve at LEAST a dollar or two. - Take sunscreen; the cool winds may fool you into thinking it's not as hot as it really is, and you will fry. - Drink lots of El Presidente - my new favorite beer.Email me if you have any questions.

<Content>Would not go Back We went to Paradisus Feb 20-24th 2006. All in all, I would say this was a 3 star hotel trying really hard to please, but does fall short on quality.The food was merely passible. The entertainment was the same as I would have seen at my daughters high school musicals, and unless you are really into water sports, there is nothing to do but lay by the pool or beach!The room had a cockroach in the minifridge, and sand fleas in the bathroom.Although one phone call took care of this,I just feel that before check-in a room should be inspected for cleanliness. The curtains in our room were also stained with something brown and gross, and although I asked for someone to address this,no-one ever did. Also, bring lots of sunscreen, my whole family got totally toasted in the HOT, HOT,sun! Not quite the Paradise we expected, and the city is so poor and deserted,I would not reccomend going off the property. Next year we would definitely not return to this resort or this country..there are plenty of other places to go!!

<Content>Loved It Let me start by saying our Travel Agency was GoAwayTravel (--) and they were wonderful. They walked us thru everything step by step. Jane, our advisor answered every question no matter how small it was and never made me feel like I was asking too many questions or being stupid.We stayed at the Paridisius in Punta Cana. The trip was thru Apple Vacations. The Apple Vacation Transfer Busses were little to be desired, but I took into consideration that you are also on an island. One bus was very musty and the other had alot of knats.The Paridisius was awsome. The language barrier was a little difficult but we all made it thru. If they did not understand, they found someone who could translate. A word of caution...if you are going with a teenage girl....keep an eye on them. The latin guys down there love the young girls and they do not hide it. They are very forward even if the parents are right there. There were very tiny little ants in the room, but I had expected to have bugs on an island. The food was awsome. Bothmy daughter and I were fine, but my hubby had some stomach problems. The beaches were the most beautiful I have ever seen. They were so clean. The water was a crystal blue/green and the sand was so white.The resort was truly all inclusive (horseback riding, golfing, smokes (Marlboro), alcohol and food. Even room service was included!I could keep going, but all in all I would definately recommend both GoAwayTravel (--)and the Paridisus in Puta Cana to anyone who asked me.Dawn White Plains, NY

<Content>Wonderful people We stayed at Paradisus the last week of January, 2006. What we loved about this resort is the people--they're wonderful. Nothing but happy, smiling faces wanting to help us in any way they could. On our second night at the resort, I contacted the ladies working at the Royal Service desk (Olga was wonderful) and let them know that my husband liked scotch and peanuts. Well, every night someone would be at our room with scotch and peanuts! We couldn't believe it. If you decide to go to this resort, upgrading to the Royal Service is a must! The rooms are closer to the beach, and the staff working at the Royal Service area are amazing. There's nothing we asked for that they didn't provide. A nice touch is the restaurant in the Royal Service building where you can go for breakfast each morning - it's a small, quiet restaurant and the food and service were superb. On the night of our anniversary, they prepared a special jacuzzi for us which was waiting for us in our room when we returned after dinner. It was so romantic - candles lit all around the tub, bubbles and rose petals all over the tub - it was wonderful (Nelson did that for us - he was our favorite!) Another perk of having the royal service is that they will make reservations for you at all the restaurants - so we had reservations made for the remainder of the week at all the different restaurants. The restaurants are all wonderful - truly 5 star food and service. The beach was terrific - unfortunately our weather wasn't very good, and the wind was horrible, which forced us to stay at the pool a few days, where the wind wasn't quite as strong. One bit of advice that I would like to pass along is how important it is to tip. We brought 100 $1 bills and used them all. Tipping is appreciated and it does not go unnoticed. You will be given a little bit of preferential treatment if you tip - and $1 here and there really goes a long way. We tipped our maids, the Royal Service ladies, the butler, the bartenders, etc. - they were so incredibly appreciative, and on more than one occasion, didn't want to accept it. Olga kept telling us that she was just doing her job, but in our opinion, she went way beyond just doing her job. There is a new swimming pool being built for Royal Service guests, and we think it is very necessary. The main pool became very busy, and the second pool will help alleviate the congestion at the main pool. Overall - we had a fabulous trip, and would definitely recommend this resort to anyone. We would like to plan a trip back here again some day.

<Content>Second Visit to Paradisus We visited the week of 2/12 - 2/19 (missed day one due to Northeast Blizzard). This was our second stay at Paradisus and our fourth visit to the Dominican Republic. Again, the food was excellent in quality and variety at the a la carte restaurants. We ate twice at the seafood restaurant and once at the French, Italian, Brazilian,  Japanese (on our first visit we had also tried the Chinese and Mexican). Reservations were required only for the Japanese and French, and could both be made at one time, rather than having to waste time waiting in line to sign up each day for that evening. The food also was good at the breakfast and lunch buffets, with much variety and freshness, and obvious cleanliness. We did not speak with anyone who became ill. The waitstaff were very freindly and attentive. Tips were appreciated.We returned to this resort after trying Iberostar Bavaro two years ago, which was also very nice, but the food was not as good and although we were told we could dine at any restaurant at the resort, we could not get reservations for the restaurants we wanted. Not so at Paradisus. We also found that resort to be larger in area, but also more crowded in feel than Paradisus.While the bars at Paradisus were busy, especially during the evening, service was prompt, especially if a tip was observed by the bartender. The mixed drinks were good; the wine was varied among the restaurants and the bars (not the same brand or country of origin), which was nice. Bottled water was freely given, even without requesting it.Paradisus' accommodations are in need of updating; we were given an upgrade room (one with a jacuzzi bath) which was ideally close to the beach, the pool and the restaurants. The furnishings in the room showed signs of much wear and the bed was very uncomfortable (worn out, probably); however, we did not spend much time in the room, anyway. The television worked, the shower water pressure was good, the water instantly hot, and the room clean and insect-free. We spent some time in the large and beautiful pool, but most of our time on the longest, widest and most beautiful beach we have ever seen. We walked daily; one day we walked from Paradisus to Paradisus' sister resort (I believe it's called Paradisus Punta Real), which took us one hour, one-way. Walking was a breeze due to the constant on-shore winds which cooled us, as did the surf. Paradisus' beach appeared as large as the largest beaches in Punta Cana, with shady areas (chickees and palm trees) available. Again, however, there were signs of wear on the beach, as most of the beach/pool loungers need replacing (sagging to the point of uncomfortable, from the weight of many tourists). We never had difficulty obtaining a lounger either at the beach or the pool. Unfortunately though, the resort could not supply clean beach towels on two days during that week (we kept returning to the kiosk only to be told, one hour, one more hour, etc., and we never received any). Many guests were quite annoyed. The beach was kept clean of debris and seaweed; there was no salty, fishy odor as can be found on some beaches.We are baby boomers - among the oldest of that group, and no longer interested in beer drinking contests, sexually suggestive pool games, really loud poolside or beach music. We are also not yet confined to rocking chairs. We went horseback riding (on the beach, very nice, also free) and sailed a hobie cat; otherwise, our activities involved walking, surf jumping, dining, drinking, socializing with American and international guests, dancing to the singer in the lobby bar area in the evening, and attending the lively, colorful and enjoyable nightly shows (featuring both Spanish and English entertainment and songs). My spouse took the quad runner trip and found it exhilirating, dangerous and fun. We did not visit the casino; as we recalled from our first visit, it was quite small and smoke-filled.We had an enjoyable vacation with, in my estimation, two drawbacks. The first was that the ground transport to and from the airport seemed downright unsafe (a cracked front windshield and a smashed rear door on the small van, plus a driver who attempted to make his seriously overloaded vehicle pass trucks, buses, etc.) and uncomfortable (ineffective air conditioning for the seven passengers, one of whom was about to faint from the heat). The roads are in poor shape and the vehicle jolted everyone each time a rut or speed bump was navigated. The ride lasted about a half-hour each way. This is not Paradisus' fault, but rather the fault of our tour operator which had selected this ground transportation company.The second drawback, which may prevent us from returning to Paradisus in the future, was the omnipresence of the time share salespersons. No sooner had we checked in after a long trip than we were accompanied by the desk clerk to the greeter and his station. The greeter was, in reality a time share salesman. We had experienced this during our first trip, but it seemed more offensive this time, perhaps because we had already missed one day of our vacation. Despite my firm and repeated not interested, my spouse was more polite and spoke with the man a bit while we were brought a drink from the bar. This apparantly was all the man required to decide to give us an appointment to visit the resort where the shares are sold, which I indicated I would not keep. We were finally allowed to get to our room. On the day of the appointment, the salesman was at the breakfast restaurant waiting for us. I again indicated I would not attend the sales tour and the man was quite annoyed, telling my spouse that this job was his livelihood, etc. We did not, in fact, attend the tour; however, the salesman seemed always to be at the lobby or the restaurant area, and it was quite uncomfortable trying to avoid him.We spoke with a number of people at the airport and on our return flight, all of whom described their particular resort's pros and cons. As a result of their comments as well as our previous travel experiences both in the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean destinations (rather than compare it with the U.S. or European destinations), I gave this resort an above average rating this time. I would like to have given it an excellent rating based on the cleanliness and quality of the food and beverages, the variety of the enjoyable entertainmnet, the cosmopolitan nature of its clientele, the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff (who all spoke a little to a lot of English [with the exception of the housekeepers]), and the beauty of the grounds and beach. Unfortunately, due to the need to update the room and beach/pool loungers, but especially due to the time share salespersons, I do not feel it is a five-star resort.

<Content>This resort really grows on you! My husband and I along with our two children (ages 10 and 12) just returned from a very nice trip to Punta Cana. We chose to stay at the Paradisus after a lot of research. We origionally were booked to go to our favorite hotel in Cancun but it is still closed due to the hurricane. We enjoy quiet settings with nice people and beautiful beaches. Upon arrival our check in was very smooth. Do not get fooled by the time share people trying to orientate you to the hotel - they are not hotel staff, but salesmen. Our room was adequate, large enough except for the two small, double, hard beds (only real complaint of the room). We must have had a recently renovated room because the decor looked updated. The bathroom structurally was older with marble but the bathtub/shower was new. The cleaning woman was excellent. Our room always had plenty of water, towels and was cleaned well and early in the day. The grounds were beautiful and meticulous. Everyday, all day, they were being worked on by gardeners. The pool was large and beautiful. The children stayed in all day and had a wonderful time. My only complaint by the pool was the fact that the music would get very loud at times (I did ask them to turn it down a few times and they did respect my request). The clientele at the hotel during our stay was mainly couples over 35 years of age so I did not feel that the loud music was necessary. I love to look at the sea. However, the way this hotel is set up you can not see the water from the pool. I was disappointed by the fact that the children could not swim and I could not see the ocean at the same time. The beach itself was maintained very well. The water is a bit choppy so seaweed does churn up a bit but the staff cleans it up. While the beach was beautiful it did lack character (ex. no large rocks or anything on interest). I felt that the food at this hotel was excellent considereing it is an all inclusive (One night my daughters lobster was completely raw- opaque. She did know not to eat it so there was no harm.) The Dominican staff was absolutely wonderful, professional, efficient and nice. I can not say enough about the way they treated our children. The service was quick and if we were kept waiting for a minute it was always acknowledged (I never thought the wait was unreasonable). Overall, this hotel really grew on us. The children had a wonderful time and were never bored- so the adults had a wonderful time and could read a book. Even though our room did not overlook the ocean after a few days you got used to it and enjoyed the tropical foliage from your balcony. If you like all-inclusives and prefer the pool to an ocean you would enjoy your stay at the Paradisus - we did!

<Content>Beautiful property Paradisus exceeded our expectations. Lets face it if you are going to the Dominican Republic it is because of the price,weather and beaches.This place scored a 10 on all three of these. It is not a 5 star but still a wonderful place. Absolutely beautiful property and wonderful staff. Restaurants were better than expected considering this is all inclusive. We spent several hundred tipping and think it was well worth it. If you can afford to go on a Carribean vacation you can reward the people that help make your stay so enjoyable. I don't think the hotel actually gives the staff the gratuities you paid with your all inclusive price, do you? The staff really appreciates your generosity and they let you know it with cigars,cigarettes quick service. The europeans probably don't like it but what do they like about us anyway. Change is hard to get so bring a couple hundred singles. We have gone on a cruise, Aruba, and the Bahamas the last three years and will probably go back to the Paradisus again next year..you just can't beat the the value and beauty of this resort.Practic your spanish a little...it helps and its fun. I will check this site if anyone has questions.

<Content>Relax and enjoy, Paradisus is awesome! I could not wait to return from our stay, and write this review. We joked all week over the terrible reviews of the Paradisus. Honestly, while we are not extremely wealthy world travelers, we have done a fair amount of traveling and found this hotel to be the best ever! Of course it is possible that some peoples maids were better than others, waiters, etc. and that some rooms had problems that others did not have. That being said, anyone who plans to go to this hotel, should not be concerned at all. I was very concerned after reading all the negative reviews. THE ROOM:We are timeshare owners, and our home resort is in Mexico. While that hotel has a beautiful beachfront, and decor in the lobby and restaurants, the timeshare rooms are just AWFUL compared to the regular hotel rooms. We have complained long and loud about this unfairness, and our concerns are never addressed. Our room at the Paradisus(a timeshare room) is probably not as nice as a REGULAR room. We all agreed that it was still a great room. There is a king sized bed with bathroom and bidet, then a small sunken living room with two loveseats, table and chairs, and a balcony with furniture. There is a mini bar (stocked with water, and various sodas) Whenever we wanted more of one type of soda, more water, etc., we just left a note. They did not stock with beer, but I am sure they would have if we told them we wanted it.The air conditioner worked fine, although we adusted the temp with the fan speed as it did not seem to change if you changed the temp control up or down. There was a name card with the name of your maid for the week, along with a number to call if you needed anything. We always had plenty of towels, etc. and on three different days, had beautiful tropical flowers adorning our bathroom sink and tub. Yes, we did tip a little, but received great service BEFORE tipping. We had read online that people there don't have much access to makeup, toys, etc. Our friends brought a variety of makeup, toy cars, color books and crayons from the dollar store and left them for the maid with a note each day. I only know a little bit of spanish, but it probably helps. The maids would thank us daily for our small gifts and tips, with big smiles!THE GROUNDS: As even the most negative reviews state, the grounds and landscaping are GEORGEOUS. There are workers raking, mowing, planting, digging everywhere. There are beautiful ponds and fountains, cobblestone pathways, lush tropical greenery and bright pink and purple flowers EVERYWHERE. There are signs pointing to the different restaurants, spa, pool, etc. We even tipped a guy raking one day(not someone normally getting tips) he just beamed! he kept chuckling and smiling as we walked away.THE SHUTTLE BUS: Again, we read negative reviews about the shuttles. There are buses going around the grounds all of the time, and you never had to wait long. We usually just started to walk and along would come a shuttle. If you really don't want to walk at ALL, call for a shuttle to come to your room. The only really long walk was from our room to the main lobby, as our room(as we requested) was near the beach and pool area. It is a big property, but most of the restaurants, pool, beach, and bars, are only a short walk from the other. Just one bar and two restaurants are near the lobby.THE LOBBY AND HOTEL INTERIOR: Again, everywhere you walk is eye candy All parts of this hotel are partially indoors but open to the outdoors. Lush fountains, ponds, flamingos, greenery, flowers everywhere.There were these GREAT outdoor lounges with big coffee tables, sofas, and chairs with a roof, decorative wrought iron sides, and pretty foliage all around. We'd sit there for an after dinner cocktail after a restaurant meal. SOOOOOO relaxing. THE POOL: This lake style swimming pool meanders in and out of lush palm trees, foliage and flowers. It is like there are separate natural pool areas, pool was never crowded, and had a great poolside and swimup bar. If anything, at times the drinks were too strong! I saw no evidence of no alcohol put into drinks. There were many chairs, and palapa huts to use. There were only about three cabanas(huts with mattresses) and we got one the first day after going down there about 7:30 a.m. We preferred to look at the oceanside the rest of our stay. Hey, why complain about not getting a cabana? It's first come first serve, the early bird gets the worm theory.They did not have waiters around the pool area, so we just camped out close to the bar:) Hey, no worries.THE BEACH: There were many chairs and palapas to be had, and we never had problems getting new towels. The ocean was beautiful, and the sand was a soft, fine light tan. There were topless women, but certainly not too many. And again, they serve many Europeans so that is just the way it is. Just a few. The Royal service area was roped off, and just had drink service and different, thicker chairs. We thought we were treated royally anyway:) We don't know how RS could be any better...RESTAURANTS: Yes, you need to make reservations for the French and Japanese restaurants. Make them as soon as you can upon arrival. We tried most of them.EL ROMANTICO(french) was very elegant and lovely, you cross a bridge over a pond to enter it. It was partially outdoors as everyplace there is. You NEVER see a bug, it's amazing! Our waiter, Richard, was terrific. The experience was very romantic and food was very good. I am not a french food expert, but found plenty of choices. All restaurant menus are printed in English, Spanish, French and German(some of them have Russian too.) SAKURA(Japanese) was our least favorite. I don't think the food was poor quality, probably we just didn't like the type of seasonings used in these dishes. You had a twelve person seating around a grill and watched the chef prepare all of the food. It was fun to watch, and the service was excellent.ABUFERA(Spanish) was very good. We got a Flintstone serving of meat, and several dipping sauces to choose from. All of the restaurants had appetizer, main dish, and dessert(sometimes soup courses)MEXICAN(the name escapes me now) Yes, there is a SPANISH and a MEXICAN restaurant at the Paradisus. This also was a great place with great ambiance. The head waiter, greeter? not sure what he is! Estubiu was just so welcoming and friendly. Is this the best Mexican food I've ever had? No, but I guess I don't expect perfection from an all inclusive resort with lots of restaurants. It was still good. LE DOLCE VITA(Italian)We had lunch here, and it was very good. They also make pizzas you can order late at night.RODDIZIO(Brazilian)This was our VERY favorite. Maybe we are just carnivores. There was a salad bar, then they would come to your table with big skewers of grilled meat, and slice a piece off for you. We had turkey wrapped in bacon, pork, sausage, lamb, beef, and chicken. This meat was to DIE FOR!!. We even took photos of the cooks and waiters to show our awe!CHINESE(name?) This was very pretty with paper lanterns hanging on the sides, right by a pond, and open to the outside. The food was very good.HYBISCUS AND LA PALAPA GRILL: These were the buffets and both were good. We ate in the Hybiscus for breakfast, usually the Palapa(on the beach) for lunch. While it is true that some food is not that hot or cold, part of this is a European influence. The Hybiscis has their food in a separate room with automatic sliding glass doors. Never did we feel the food was dangerous or bug infested. There was such a variety, that I can't imagine you wouldn't find SOMETHING you like to eat. ROOM SERVICE: Room service was 24 hours. It took me about twenty minutes for my food to arrive. It is a limited menu, but adequate. I loved eating my breakfast out on our balcony.ALL INCLUSIVE ACTIVITIES: I'm sure that there are others, but this was an all inclusive like no other we'd ever heard of. They include horseback riding and scuba! This does not happen anywhere else that we know of. You just sign up at the beach shack. If you ask a question, someone will answer it for you-it was as simple as that! There are free stages shows in the Paradisus theatre at night, didn't go but watched from lobby bar. They looked great. There were different bands and singers each night. One night they had a dance contest, everyone looked like they were having a blast! The casino was airconditioned and elegant. I'm not really a gambler, but several people looked like they were enjoying it. LAST BUT NOT LEAST-THE SERVICE: Do NOT BELIEVE what negative reviews say about this hotels service. It was just excellent!. Everyone was so friendly, and aimed to please. Our friend asked a waiter if he had a cigar for him. He told him no, I'm sorry My friend said, Thats'sok He told him,No, just a minute, Senor' He was gone about five minutes, and came back with a cigar! This happened twice!. The Paradisus is a very warm and inviting place, unlike our cold and impersonal hotel in Mexico. If there were any SMALL problems, they were looked into immediatly. Negatives(not really, but I am looking hard for something bad to say)My room card stopped working once. I called the desk, in 10 minutes a shuttle came with a new key:)No wait service in the pool area bar(not a big deal to me)Some restaurants not open between 3-7 p.m.( We just planned around these hours, you can still get room service,or a sandwich till 4 p.m. at the pool bar)Scuff marks on our bedroom wall-Oh, come on! This is true, but how could it ruin your vacation??Other reviews actually complain about this!Lastly, I want to mention some very special treatment. We informed the hotel that we would have a visit from a child we sponsor in the Dominican, along with a translator and a school staff person. They told us we would recieve a 15% discount in the restaurants for our guests. When the guests arrived, the manager personally introduced himself to us and told us the childs meal would be free!. As we walked to our room, a housekeeper chased us down and handed a gift to our sponsored child!!.This was above and beyond basic service, it was service with a heart. We just love the Paradisus, and hope to visit there many times! Hope someone has the patience for this LOOONG review. Maybe the negative reviewers stayed during March and it was much busier, and service was not as good?

<Content>Still one of the better resorts! My wife, son (age 14) and I just returned after staying at this resort from Feb 9th to 16th.My son and I were there in 2004 and really wanted to return to show it off to my wife.Everybody needs to take into consideration that the Dominican is a developing country and although it's difficult to satisfy everybody all of the time, the resort does a fine job and qualifies as one of the better places to stay in the Dominican if not the Carribean.Rooms are average but adequate, pool is huge, landscaping is unbelievable, beach is one of the best, ocean is generally free of sea weed with waves that can top 6 feet on occassion. The lobby area is really nice especially in the evening, they have a nice casino large enough for the gamblers staying on the resort, food and beverages galour. Learn some basic Spanish before you go. Things like please, thank you, hello, coffee, sugar and milk take you a long way to getting what you want although not always required because most of the staff already recognize them in English. Just don't expect to have full length conversations with each of these people! Imagine if the shoe were on the other foot after all.Things are slower down in the DR. If you're accustomed to the fast-life like most of us are, relax you're on vacation, you'll be okay. Sure, there will be times when service is really slow, food is under cooked etc... but that can happen anywhere in the world, anytime. If your thinking of staying here, try it, you probably won't be disappointed. I've read the reviews, stayed here twice and believe that the bad reviews are not entirely reflective of the real or full picture. As an example, our room had a problem with the toilet that continuously ran water. Not a problem really because it didn't ruin our sleep but just something that really bugged my wife. Four days into the vacation a nice Guest Services person walked up to us in the lobby bar area and asked if everything was ok. My wife explained the problem to her and by the time we returned from the lobby that evening (no more than 2 hours later) the problem was addressed. Probably could have dealt with this on day one if we would have only asked?If you plan on golfing......do it! One of the better facilities and courses I've played at in the Carribean and I've played in Mexico, Jamaica, Bahamas, Cuba and Costa Rica. For $35US, you cannot go wrong.I hope you find this review useful and wish you a pleasant stay wherever that may be.

<Content>good to great I read the reviews for this resort over several months and was unsure of what I would find. Our conclusion is that this resort is good to great, but I can see why some people don't like it. My wife and I and another couple visited from February 9 to February 13. We stayed in the Royal Service area. I think that if all of the regular rooms were refurbished then you may not need it but we liked it and would use the Royal Service again. We liked the food but its not 5 star; it varies from 3 to 4 star and if you are picky then you might not like the lunch buffet. Dinner was very good in the 4 restaurants we went to and they always had the wine we requested. None of us ever got sick.We tipped as others have mentioned and I assume it helped. Most of the staff is very helpful and friendly.Its true that the bed mattress was a bit stiff. It seemed cheap; the pillows also. But we still slept well and it didn't bother us. The air conditioner worked okay but not great. This was a problem only in that the maid used too much water to mop the floor every morning and our room ended up humid over a period of 4 days. Next time I will pay more attention if this seems to be a problem. The shower head didn't work as good as it should have.We noticed a slight sewer smell in one area of the resort. We know a little Spanish and it helps for sure, especially if you want to do several activites and need to sign up for stuff and ask detailed questions about activities.I can see an American couple that speaks no Spanish and comes expecting 5 star room and food not liking this place at all. As for us, we liked it alot and plan on returning. I agree with everything that is said in the Feb 1 review.Finally, we did not like taking a big tour company bus from the airport to the resort. It took too long both ways. Next time we hope to take a taxi. Even though we left the Paradisus 2 1/2 hours before plane departure, we got there after about one hour to find the airport jammed with people and long lines everywhere. It was confusing. You want to get to the airport on the return at least 2 hours before departure.

<Content>Great for us...not so for others We found our bus right away and took the 40 min., but comfortable ride to the resort. Check in took a while, but we ultimatly got a room one building from the beach. Right next to Royal Service! The room was in despertate need of renovations, but we spent so little time there, it was fine. Air conditioning barely worked. We had it set at the lowest temp and it was only somewhat comfortable We did have to call down for bath towels every day as the maid never left them! Tipping her only got worse service!The beach was fantastic! We walked for ever! Pool was huge with a great swim up bar and we always ended our beach day there. Only thing was the pool closed at 6, kinda early. We like a late night swim. Every dinner was wonderful. We tried almost every resturant and found something good at each. Lunch was fun too. We liked the grill on the beach so I would get take out pizza and meet my husbad there. Never got room service.We did take the horse back ride on the beach that was included and it was fantastic!! However, it took some work finding the info about it. One guy even tried to sell us the same package for $60 saying the resort one was ten mintues walking in a circle! Not so. We ultimatly found out that you have to go to the activities building on the beach to book it. Internet access was $5 for 30 minutes which was just enough to write to the kids a few times. One last note.....I had written an e mail to the resort a month before we arrived requesting a quiet room and 6 pillows. Upon arrival, they had no record of it and when I showed it to her, she said they were full and at least we had a room. During the week we spoke to a few couples who had been bumped to another resort the first night because the hotel over booked. Apparently, the huge Verizon convention that was there wanted to stay an extra night and the hotel let them.......even though they had other reservations!!! It did not affect us, but I am leary about ever going back because of how they treated guests arriving guests.For us, it was a great, much needed vacation.

<Content>Paradisus is what it claims to be. I feel badly for people whom simply can not understand that a property that is ALL INCLUSIVE and not literally $900/night per double is NEVER going to be up to par with a Luxury Resort such as Four Seasons etc.. It is embarassing when so many fellow Americans have such unrealistic expectations. This is a lovely property. It is not as efficient as it could be. If you are patient with the staff and do your best to try to communicate, they will go out of their way to help you. Most service people speak very little English if any. Buy a small book of Spanish phrases and you will not have any problems. Almost all management speaks English.I WOULD definitely bring at least 100 $1 bills. That was a great suggestion from someone who recently posted a review. Tip for good service, you don't have to but the people here are so nice and genuine that you will want to.Make dinner reservations as soon as you get there. The Japanese, Mexican, French, and Steakhouse are all quite good. Even the Chinese was pretty good. You may want to make reservations at the Japanese and French (El Romantico) restaurants twice, they are both good and a little different. Seafood restaurant is nice as well. The wine is great, even the domestic. The Italian restaurant is an excellent lunch choice. The pina coladas are horrible, they are made from a mix and in a giant machine. They are way too sweet. If you want something frozen order something else and they will make it fresh. A Capriani (I have no idea how to spell that)is rum, sugar, water, and limes it is similar to a mojito and is really light and refreshing. Horseback riding on the beach was delightful and included. Take advantage of the bike ride, Eco-Tours, yoga classes etc.. The activities here are all included and worthwhile. The kids program is included and great. They have to be 5.Try to mix up what you eat every night. The food is all bought by the same resort so you will notice similarities. The shrimp was great everywhere. The beef was particularly good as well (maybe Argentinian).I would definitely go back. This is an unbelieveable value for everything that is included. The nearby Paradisus Palma Real, although not finished yet, is gorgeous.

<Content>Mixed experience We were there the last week of January. A very mixed experience, the end result of which is we would not go back.Staff: Most of the staff was very nice and helpful to the extent of their English, which combined with our little bit of Spanish was usually OK. Some were especially friendly and helpful, some could not be bothered. Typcial, I think. We tipped here and there which was mch appreciated.Food: The steakhouse, the French (El Romantico - book as soon as you can) and the Mexican were all very good, with wonderful service. The Italian was awful at lunch, the Brazilian was bland, and the buffet at the fish place was terrible - don't bother. I did hear people raving about the Italian, though, so maybe we just ordered wrong. The breakfast place was always good, with very nice staff. My companion got sick, we were not sure what from - perhaps just brushing teeth using tap water for the first day. I did the same, but did not get sick. But then we switched to bottled for everything. The bottled water is good and provided all over the place.Drinks: If you want a mixed drink, you need to order carefully. Either it will be alcohol free, or poorly made. Wine was always good.Beach/Pool: The beach was beautiful and clean, but unfortunately the wind was so rough that after the second day sitting on the beach was a trial. Our eyes got sand blasted. Which brings us to the pool...It is a beautiful pool, but because of the beach situation, it was way too crowded, and at times like a public beach on a July weekend. Not pleasant. If you did not get there early, you did not get a seat. (though I know some people paid the towel guy to find them seats, and that worked).Room, grounds, facilities: The room was nice enough, but worn out looking. Needed new bedding, etc. Towels were changed every day, but we seemed to get fewer given than taken away! The main area is beautiful, with a lot of nice seating. The grounds were ok, everything was walkable. The spa was nice, though the steam room never worked, in spite of our being told daily that it would work tomorrow. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Not too hard on selling the extras. The ecological walk was a total joke - a fake, dirty little walkway with two sad monkeys in a cage. Stay away from it - it will make you sad. In sum, I'd rather go somewhere with more natural surroundings, perhaps less contained so that if it does get crowded you can get away. It was not a relaxing place to be.

<Content>Beautiful days on the beach- Horrible nights in the bathroom Recently traveled to Paradisus from 1/31 to 2/4. The resort itself is amazing, from the grounds, lobby, and beach they are all A+.The rest of the resort is a culinary nightmare. The food is a disgrace and can't even be considered eidble. My wife spent the first night in the bathroom, and I, the remaining two.If you watch the cooks prepare the food, just think of two words cross-contamination.For the price $3500 it was hardly a bargin.And yes, we did try all the restraunts, so it was hard to decipher exactly which one made us sick.We came home a day early suntanned and hungary.Don't go.

<Content>Above Average Experience Background: My wife and I are late 30s, professionals, and booked an all-inclusive in the hope we would not have to think OR worry about anything. We chose the Paradisus based on international flavor (less ugly Americans), access to golf, and ability to book the Royal Service (resort within the resort idea which we like).Summary: 90% of our expectations were met, with the 10% being inconveniences versus real problems. While expensive ($450/night at the Royal level), the resort provided us with above average value.Royal Service: Positives - (1) Beachfront, second floor, corner room in good, not great shape; (2) Royal service lounge (private breakfast, free internet); (3)concierge service all requests //// Negatives - (1) The private Royal Service pool will not be open till late this year; (2) beach waiter service was non-existent; (3) check out was confusedStaff and Service: 60% great, 30% fair, 10% indifferent. Special mention to Stenio in the Royal Lounge - muchas gracias senor!Beach and Pool: AstoundingCocotal Golf: Good resort course, wide open, excellent grooming, large fast true greens, and a three club wind made it interesting.Food: Fine to above average across the board - dined at French, Italian, Steakhouse, Grill, and multiple orders from room service. Always had my wine choice.Liquor and cigarettes: Top shelf and freely available in excess!Tipping: Yes it helps (no surprise) - we distributed $60 - $80 over four days.In closing: This is a 5 star DR resort - which means it is a 3.5 star on the global scale.

<Content>Beautiful lush surroundings in Paradisus We spent six nights at the Paradisus in January. We opted for the Royal Service and were so glad we did. The only thing missing was the butler service. He met us the first day, offered all kinds of service, and we never saw him again. The resort is beautiful, the restaurants and service were great. I think the beach is the nicest one in the Caribbean. Soft sand and miles of beach. The only problem was the wind. It was so windy we could not sit on the beach. We learned from some of the help that January, and sometimes February, are very windy months. Wish we had known that and we would have waited till March. It is a resort you will love.

<Content>We Loved the Paradisus PC, Can't wait to go back!! I can't begin to tell you how wonderful our vacation was. We were there Jan 19-25. We had so much fun, we are already planning a return trip with our friends.We did get the Royal Service upgrade which we fully enjoyed. It probably would have been great without it, but we did enjoy our ocean front room and the special service we did receive when we asked for it.The food was great, and the staff was always happy and ready to helpWe didn't mind the spaciousness of the resort one bit. It gave us time to walk off our meals. When you look at the different restaurants be aware they sometimes have very beautiful outdoor seating that sometimes is a little more romantic then the main seating.With the Royal Service your butler would fill a romantic bath upon request...Your jacuzzi would be filled with bubble bath, and flower pedals will be spread around the tub, with cute little candles to lite the way. A bottle of champaine or wine chilled to perfection for your enjoyment. It was just such a really romantic special service that I found so enjoyable when my husband surprised me with it. ( a great way to earn brownie points guys!)The whole resort was fantastic. Go with the expectation of a fun, relaxing vacation, and you should have a great time

<Content>Disappointed. Not Recommended. Stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana Jan. 16-23, 2006. Paid $375 per night for 2 adults, all-inclusive. Booked via the hotel's website and purchased our airline tickets directly from AA.Paradisus is 25-30 minutes from the airport (PUJ). A taxi will cost $25 one-way. US Dollars are accepted everywhere in the Dominican Republic, no need to exchange currency.The Good....The Paradisus is beautifully landscaped with lush, tropical grounds, very clean and well manicured. The lobby area is incredible, open-air and very tropical. Many of the restaurants are also open-air and very well decorated.The swimming pool is one of the largest pools we have ever seen and the beach is beautiful-- great for long walks. Our room was very nice, clean, and recently re-modeled. We did not pay for the optional Royal Service and do not recommend it.The Bad....Service. We have traveled to over 25 differnet islands in the Caribbean and have been to every country in Central America. This was the most unfriendly, unskilled, unprofessional staff we have ever seen. I would guess its more a cultural difference than a training issue. They just don't care, have no motivation, and no supervision to ensure that even the simplest tasks are completed. The poor level of service was consistant from the front dest check-in to the restaurants to the housekeeping staff. Beds. The room is nicely decorated and furnished, but the beds are hard as a rock. Other friends we were traveling with had the same experience in their rooms. And the pillows-- they only have one type: flat and old! Not what you would expect from a 4 Star, let alone a 5 Star property.Food. Most disappointing. The buffets are quite large and extensive, but the quality is just not there. The food is not hot enough. As for the restaurants, we ate at 8 out of the 10 choices. We liked the Italian and Brazilan restaurants, but again, the service was terrible. Each restaurant offers a wine list, but each night they were out of many choices. On our last night they only had 1 choice of Red. We opted for beer instead. We have stayed ot other Sol Melia properties and would rate this one at the bottom. Even Sol Melia's 3 Star resorts have better food than this place.Misc.....Other things to be aware of. The ocean is very cold. Perhaps 10 degrees colder than the BVI's or western Caribbean. There is never a problem finding a chair or palapa on the beach, but the pool chairs disappear very early in the morning. We like to walk and enjoyed walking the grounds, but you should be aware that it's a 15-20 minute walk each direction from the lobby to some rooms or the restaurant/ beach area. Also, the service vehicles, vans, tram, and scooters use the walkways and will not give way to guests. Watch out and step aside when they pass. Overall, we were disappointed and won't be going back.

<Content>Paridisus was Paradise! We just returned from 7 days at the Paradisus in Punta Cana. This place was absolutely incredible! We have traveled before, cruised and nothing compares to the week we had at the Paradisus. What a pool! The beach was clean and uncrowded. Everyone we talked to (with the exception of one couple) loved it and said they would return. We didn't get sick nor did anyone we heard of. They really take extra steps to protect the visitors so all the food, deserts, drinks, and even the table water are from a bottled source. The food was great! Our favorites were Chinese, Italian and Brazilian but all were superb. Staff was so friendly, helpful and fun. Approximately one in five spoke English well but most knew enough to be helpful. There are trams constantly running but we waited as long as 15 minutes at times. Truth is, nothing is more than a 5 minute walk anywhere on the property. We understand that the Paradisus Costa Rica and Puerto Rico are even nicer! The new Paradisus Palm Real that opened in December looks very nice too.Advice #1: Take $100 in singles. Money talks; even at an all-inclusive. Leave $1 for the maid and she'll leave fresh flowers. Give the bartender a $10 at the beginning of the week and you'll never want! They make so little that a couple of dollars goes a long way.Advice #2: There will be employees asking for 1 hour of your time to sell you a time share program. They'll give you a voucher towards a spa or hotel shop just for listening to the pitch. Don't take anything less than $75. If you avoid them, they'll hound you all week. Just give them 30 minutes and take the voucher.The only mistake we made was not staying for 2 weeks鈥?

<Content>Great vacation at the Paradisus We recently returned from a very relaxing and pleasant week at the Paradisus, Punta Cana. After reading some of the very negative reviews on this and other websites we went with very low expectations. Since this was our first experience with an all inclusive we were really concerned.We were very pleasantly surprised!!!!The check in process went smoothly, although we did have a 10-15 minute wait. It wasn't awful and they did serve us welcome cocktails at that time.We could not upgrade to Royal Service at check in so if you want it do it before you go. I'm glad that we couldn't do it because we had a great experience without it. We never made a request that wasn't answered promptly.The food was a very nice surprise. We liked all the restaurants except the big buffet-lots of food but it isn't very good and it's in a dimly lit, giant, noise filled room. The other restaurants were in lovely rooms with nice views with high quality food and attentive service. We went to all but the Brazilian BBQ. The Japanese, Italian, French and Mexican were really very good. The Steak house and Grill were not bad. We didn't care for the Chinese but it wasn't awful.By the way, we felt fine and did not get sick from the food. We drank bottled water but did have ice in our drinks. We also drank water at the table in the restaurants.The drinks were wonderful. Very nice wines and good brands of liquor. The Pina Colads are great!!!!The staff were lovely to us. We had no trouble with language at all. Most of the staff speak pretty good english...........and they really tried to help us in any way they could. We took $100 in singles and tipped those who helped us. The tips were most appreciated.We did not have any problems with beach towels, chaise lounges or reservations. I don't understand why others have had these problems.The one area that Sol Melia needs to work on is the room renovations. Our room was situated perfectly: an upper, near the beach, a short walk from the restaurants and pool but it was not renovated. Everything worked but it showed it's age. Not the type of room you feel terrific about but not awful either.Stay away from the time share guys......it's a hard sell and they are not gracious if you are not interested.The grounds and the beach are by far the most beautiful I've seen at any resort I've stayed at. Just gorgeous!!!!We both had massages on the beach and they were great!We also went on an ATV excursion which was lots of fun.The evening entertainment is pretty good. We are pretty hard to please and we enjoyed some of the shows they had. They also have some decent music in the lobby at night and a disco. The casino is small but there is a bigger one right at the hotel entrance.We've been to many other resorts in this area (Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Antigua, Aruba, St Lucia, St Martin, etc) and we usually stay at Marriott's, Hyatts, even Rockresorts (when they owned more in the area),etc. I have to say for the money you get a very relaxing vacation at the Paradisus. I would stay at Sol Melia all inclusives again.While we were there someone told us that now that the new Paradisus is open in Punta Cana Sol Melia is going to close this Paradisus for an extensive renovation of the rooms. Not a bad idea! Once that is done this will be the perfect resort.

<Content>Great vacation - Great Value Just returned from a week at the Paradisus Punta Cana. We were very concerned after reading all of the reviews. We had switched from the Iberostar Maya in Mexico after the hurricane.We loved it. We went with our 5 year old twins and we all had a fantastic time. We found the staff extremely friendly, almost everybody to be fluent enough in english to communicate and the grounds and facilities to be beautiful. I do agree with other reviews that the place has drawbacks/weaknesses. The rooms were spacious but a tad rundown (we did royal service) and the food was good but not great. (Lunch was the weakest but with the exception of the steakhouse, we loved all dinners).With that said, I found that while it might not be a 5 star hotel, we weren't paying 5 star prices. I thought the value for the money was exceptional and that any weaknesses were greatly overshadowed by the positives.My kids went to the kids club each day and for dinner most nights as well as to evening activities so my husband and I could enjoy some time to ourselves.I can understand why the resort gets mixed reviews on this site but I think if your expectations are aligned (not paying Four Seasons prices) you will be pleasantly surprised. I was!

<Content>WONDERFUL We have been to the Paradisus 2 times in the past 3 years. We are planning a trip there in February and are looking forward to it.The reason I am writing is because I feel guilty that I didn't write after the first 2 times we went to the resort because we had a wonderful time.I feel that those of us who had no complaints don't take the time to write a review because there was nothing bad to say.During our last trip we stayed in the royal service part of the time and the regular part of the resort the first half.The royal service is much nicer because the rooms are much nicer and it is much closer to the beach. The food was wonderful especially at El Romantico. During our first 2 trips we had nothing to complain about except the weather during our second trip which no one had control over. The wind was tremendous which made the beach a little unconfortable. Every other aspect of our trip was great. I am not sure what others expect from this resort by reading their reviews but we are truly looking forward to our trip next month and have booked the royal service for the entire week. I highly recommend the Paradisus in Punta Cana and have done so to many people.I feel the reason you see more negative reviews on this sight than positive reviews is because most people are like myself and had nothing bad to say and had a wonderful experience but just didn't take the time to let others know.

<Content>Good - but a little disappointed Let me start by saying that 5 years ago my boyfriend and I visited the Paradisus and absolutely loved it. It was the first All-Inclusive that I had visited it and we came home and recommended it to everyone. Since then I have visited many other All-Inclusive's in Mexico and the Caribbean (which upon comparison I found them to be better). My most recent stay at the Paradisus actually occurred by mistake (as we were supposed to go to Riviera Maya but it was damaged in the hurricane). Due to my rave reviews, my family chose the Paradisus. There were 11 of us in total. Mostly middle-aged couples with a few in their young twenties. Let me start with the pros:- The resort was absolutely beautiful. I always saw a ton of workers trimming bushes and cutting branches. I actually felt bad for them because everything they did was manual (no machines) and I can imagine how little they got paid. I simply asked one of the workers for a coconut that he had just cut down and he cleaned it for me, cut off the top, and make it drinkable. Just to be nice I gave him a $1 tip and he was very thankful. - The pool and beach were great. The water in both were the perfect temperature. There were always plenty of chairs to be had at both. It was nice because we could sit in both the shade and the sun whenever we wanted. - All in all I thought the service was good. The check-in people (at least the guy we had, but i can't remember his name) were absolultely terrific. He spoke perfect English, was joking with us and really made us feel at home. We were greeted with frozen drinks and shots of rum as soon as we arrived. The service in the restaurants (with the exception of the Mexican restaurant) was very good. Keep in mind that there are a ton of people at the resort and each staff member has many responsibilities. If you don't get what you asked for right away, just politely remind them. - Everyone was very friendly. I speak zero Spanish, but quickly picked up on a few words and as long as you are patient and make somewhat of an effort, the staff was always very nice. - Dinner reservations were easy as you could make reservations for the whoel week in advance. We had 11 people and as long as were slightly flexible in the time we wanted to eat there was never a problem with getting a table for all of us. - Japanese restaurant was our favorite. I actually thought that it was very similar in quality to what you would receive at a hibachi place at home. I did not try the sushi though, so I'm not sure about that. Yes the cook and waitress are Dominican - but what do you expect??- Also liked the steak place a lot. I ordered filet mignon and only eat my meat very well done..and they got it perfect without drying it out. Other people in my party weren't as pleased.- The Pool Bar Grill - We didn't find out about this until 2 days into our stay, but instead of going to the buffet for a sit-down lunch you can just go to the pool bar grill and order burgers, hot dogs, chicken, etc and fries. - The spa - literally the BEST massage I have ever had. I always said the my best massage was when I was there the first time, but this time was even better. I don't know what it is, maybe since you are so relaxed already..but it was just phenomenal. If you get one, have it one of the outdoor huts near the spa. It was not hot as they have a fan in the huts and they play nice music and you get a nice breeze. - If you are a serious gambler..this casino is not for you. If you are like me and like to gamble a little just to have fun, you will love it. It is small, but rarely crowded. The dealers are all friendly..and since everyone is just there to have a good time you end up making friends and everyone is helping each other and rooting for each other. - There was this cool newspaper machine that allowed you to get the current issue of almost any newspaper in the world for like $2. The cons- Compared to the first time I went I felt that the food quality had gone down. The buffets were very repetitive and not that good (although the workers-espcially the poor guys grilling in 100degree heat were great). The Mexican restaurant (which the last time was my favorite) was the worst. - The rooms definitely were a let down. The first time I was there we loved the rooms...very bright, lots of windows, nice marble bathroom. This time...it was horrible. The closet mirror was broken, there was no toilet paper holder (I know it sounds stupid but after awhile it gets annoying), the room was very dingy and not bright at all. Definitely needs an updating. Also there were a ton of little red ants. There were 3 of us staying in the room and there was only one robe and 2 towels. We always asked for more, but never got them. We finally found a linen closet in our building that was unlocked and just kept going in there to get stuff. - Certain services were very inconsistent. For instance, as I noted above we received drinks and shots when we arrived and had no problem checking in. But later in the week when I was up at the lobby I noticed a huge line at checkout and no one serving drinks. We tipped the maid and got nothing extra. But other people in our group got fresh flowers, towel animals, little gifts like soap packages, fruit baskets, etc. - There was a water main break that had the whole sidewalk near the spa and the front of the lobby totally flooded. They had actually made a sort of bridge out of benches for the service people to walk up. But it looked and smelled gross. I noticed it on my first day and thought they would clean it up but it was still there at the end of the trip. Just OK--Entertainment - the first night was the best. There were professional dancers teaching dance moves to fun and upbeat salsa music. They danced with the guests and it was a great time. The show was decent..entertaining...not Broadway but not horrible either. The reason why I say the first night was the best with these dancers is because they do the same thing every night..I mean same songs, same dance steps, same everything. By the 3rd night we had had enough..but it was still fun to watch. You have to give these guys credit..the dancers are also the activity people you see early in the morning doing the morning aerobics and they are dancing till late into the night. - The Fun Pub wans't much fun. This wasn't really the resorts fault though. There were never many people in there. We went one night for Karaoke but it was all locals hanging out in there and singing in Spanish, it was interesting for awhile, but you can only so much of music when you don't understand the language. All in all we had a great time. Its what you make of it. I always say that if you are the type of person who is going on vacation to just relax and have a good time..then you will be fine. If you are going to nit-pick every little thing and let it ruin your vacation - then this is not the resort for you. Yes the resort is big, yes there are sometimes waits for the tram - but where are you in a rush to go? Don't come here if you can't walk 10 minutes without complaining. I never took the tram once because I loved the walk through the beautiful grounds. Also, it rained every single night that I was there like clock-work. At about 7:00 it would pour. It would stop about 20 minutes later. Some people found this really annoying. Again..there is nothing you can do about nature. We had beautiful weather during the day and to me that is what matters the most. They have umbrellas in the room so that you don't get wet. I also found that if service was slow it wasn't because the workers were lazy or didn't feel like doing their job. It was because there weren't enough workers. The pool bar always got crowded around 3-4:00 but they never added another bartender. There were always the same 2 guys there every day. They work so hard and try the best they can. But of course if there are 50 people that need to be served its going to be slow. You have to expect that..this is not the US (where I find slow service is usually due to a lazy worker). Also in the bufet restaurants it can take some time to get a drink..but again..its because there is one waiter for 20 tables. Instead of getting mad and yelling, I simply got up and went to the bar and got it myself. Another example is that at the French restaurant we ordered coffee and all 11 of us got cappuccino. Well our dessert came out fine. But it took almost 45 minutes to get the cappuccinos. The group was NOT happy and kept asking for them. It turned out that the poor waitress was the one responsible for making coffees. So by herself, she had to stand ther and make 11 cups of capuccino from one machine. I wasn't fun for us and I'm sure she was doing as best she could..but you know..where else were we going??? We just took it in stride and thanked her profusely. Another tip - bring a lot of small bills - 1's, 5's - 10's. You can't get American $ down there. I heard a rumor (I have no idea if its true) that the good workers (like the chefs and waiters and bartenders) make $219US per month. They work 12 days straight and then get 3 days off. They live in barracks at the resort in rooms of 8 people. Since Punta Cana is very remote none of them actually live in Punta Cana...they get bussed in from about an hour away. So these people are not going home to family or living the life of luxury. A simple $1 or so tip goes a long way. At dinner..espcially since we had 11 people...each couple would usually give $5..making it like a $25 tip most nights...you should have seen the happiness on their faces. Another tip - when you get to the airport you have to buy a customs form for $10. Make sure you KEEP this when they hand it back to you as you need it for you return. Simply put...don't be rude, don't be lazy, don't act like you are a king and these people are your servants. This is a third world country that has only been developed in the last 5-10 years. They have improvements to make, but for the money and what you get...you can't beat it. I am actually going back to the DR this week (to the Melia Caribe Tropical) so I would recommend both DR and the Paradisus - although I won't go back a 3rd time - there are too many other places to try!If you have any questions, please email me. I'd love to help.

<Content>No Royal service One week at a resort that advertises a ROYAL SERVICE and can charge for such but does not deliver. It lacks the attention to detail required to class itself as a five star. We had a very nice room 2191 close to all facilities but the only difference between us and those that paid far less was a bigger tv and a slightly larger room. If you get this property as a sell off or at a reduced rate go for it BUT DON'T PAY full price and NEVER book the Royal Service because they CANNOT DELIVER. If you are use to the treatment at a Sandals go back to a Sandals, we all work too hard these days and you want what you paid for so pay the slightly higher price at a Sandals but return home refreashed and not frustrated. We had planned on visiting Paradisus Costa Rica but based on this adventure will not.

<Content>Dont Go There---Not A 5 Star Resort! I totally agree with the person's review from January 14th. Customer is definitely not a first priority. They literally could give two craps. and for what people pay for, it's a total rip-off. Basic things can not even be met. It's sad because it is a gorgeous resort and beautiful beach, but the management is terrible and I personally thought the food was as well, except for the Italian. I'm never going back there again. SOL MELIA help this place out!

<Content>A beautiful resort and a great place to unwind I just got back from the Paradisus yesterday and we had a wonderful trip. It was not without a few small frustrations, but no vacation to a foreign country ever really is. We did Royal Service, and I must recommend it for several reasons. The room location is the best -- it was so convenient to be on the ocean and have a very short walk to the restaurants and pool. I didn't see the inside of a non-Royal Service room, but ours was beautifully decorated and must have been recently renovated. Also, it was wonderful to be able to pick up a phone, dial the Royal Service extension, and have anything delivered, taken care of, etc. With one phone call to RS, they would take care of spa reservations, a room service delivery, and housekeeping request. To me, the Royal Service staff always made me feel like I had someone to turn to for help -- they spoke excellent English and you could call them with any questions or needs. The private check-in and check-out are very convenient. Also, the RS beach offers waiter service. There is only one bar on the huge beach, so we found it very convenient to stay in the RS section of the beach. Tip the waiter and he'll stop by your chair often.Overall, we were surprised how much of the staff spoke English, but we also tried to speak as much Spanish as we could. I don't think we can complain about people in a foreign country not speaking our native language, especially when this resort caters to people of so many cultures, not just English speakers. The food was great. El Romantico has the best filet mignon, and the Chinese restaurant was amazing. We found something we liked at each restaurant we tried. We even ordered things from Room Service at midnight that weren't on the Room Service menu. (Advice: skip the lobster an El Marino -- it was very fishy when served for dinner and in the paella at lunch.)We would highly recommend Paradisus for its beauty, cleanliness, food, and attention to detail in every aesthetic aspect of the resort. (Notice the fresh flowers in each public bathroom, and the way the gutters look like teacups so they channel the water off the roof to the ground in a beautiful way.) I'd be afraid to try another resort in the DR because it might not compare to the Paradisus.

<Content>Objective account of what you will get for your money Here you probably are, planning to spend $300-$400 a night for a great vacation at the beach in a 5-star all-inclusive resort. Well, here is what awaits you, the good and the bad.Let鈥檚 start with the good stuff. The beach is very nice with enough space to lie both in the sun and in the shade. That being said, the Paradisus doesn鈥檛 have exclusive access to it as a number of other resorts share this long strip of sand. The pool has a very nice design and is extremely pleasant, so much so that a good number of guests seemed to prefer it to the beach. The grounds, as many reviewers have said, is superb and gives a real exotic touch to this resort. Finally, we were pleasantly surprised by the food variety and quality overall.Now for the not-so-great stuff. In one word, the Paradisus is NOT a 5-star hotel, far from it. Although the Paradisus is a fairly new resort its rooms already show their age. The paint looks old, the color choice is dreadful, the furniture is tasteless. A couple of interesting things to note: ants, broken king-size bed, broken lights, dirty bathtub, questionable bed sheets, terrible sound-proofing of the main door. After two days we filled out a form to have some of these things taken care of. Eleven days later we were still waiting鈥?Noise can be a major problem, especially if you have neighbors who take full advantage of the free booze and the casino which closes at 3:00am. Indeed, you will encounter people from all four corners of the world with different views about what constitutes appropriate behavior at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. Be warned! Now on to room service. Expect to have to call for everything, we mean everything: towels, soap, shampoo, water, fridge refills, etc. Even Motel 6 gets this right!Let鈥檚 move on to restaurant service. Here again, the key is to be proactive, otherwise you鈥檒l simply be ignored: ask for more water, ask for more coffee, more wine, etc. To boot waiters are most inefficient. Case in point: the self-service area ran out of cereal bowls - a daily occurrence mind you! - so after asking three different employees I finally get someone鈥檚 attention, and he goes to the kitchen and brings back鈥NE bowl! Never mind the five other guests behind me who also wanted one. As for the more formal restaurants, don鈥檛 be fooled by the many choices of wines and dishes. Many times they told us that 鈥渢hey just ran out鈥?of this particular wine! One night at the Chinese restaurant they 鈥渏ust ran out鈥?of duck (for me) and tofu (for my wife) even though we were the first to order that night. To wrap up the food section I鈥檒l add that the hours are inconvenient: all restaurants open at 7:00pm for dinner. I don鈥檛 know about you, but sometimes (especially if you have kids) we like to eat earlier, all the more so when you realize that it gets dark really early (~5:30pm).Finally, the worst part: the reception service. These were probably the most unfriendly employees I have met in the hotel business. They will stop processing your request to answer the phone and chat for five minutes with what seemed to be a good friend of the clerk. They will send you to your room, and when you realize that you need a lock for the safe they will tell you to come down to the front desk to get it (a good 15-minute walk). But that鈥檚 if everything goes well. If you are like my wife鈥檚 parents who came 2 days later, then they won鈥檛 have a room for you! I guess they 鈥渏ust ran out鈥濃€?This is also a daily occurrence it seems. Indeed, I overheard conversations of other guests who were in a similar bind the next day. I barely tolerate airlines overbooking, but 5-star resorts overbooking?!?In closing, let me add that knowledge of Spanish is essential. English and French are rarely understood, so brush up starting now!In a nutshell, management at the Paradisus Punta Cana (and maybe Solmelia management in general) seems to think that because of some of the enviable attributes of its resort, namely the beach, the pool and the grounds, it can get away with substandard service and unfriendly and untrained staff. Well, I disagree because it leaves us with the uneasy feeling that management is lining their pockets by charging western prices and hiring unskilled local labor at third-world rates, stashing away the difference. That alone should be reason enough to look elsewhere.

<Content>We were not in Paradise Our stay in Hotel Paradisus for 8 nights has not been good. The price we paid and the service provided us has not been of 5*****Quality and the reason are:Transportation to the hotel was very confusing. No welcome drink or greeting upon arrival. We saw it later with other arrivals. Room serviceRoom service needs management. Not enough towels or sometimes nothing until 6pm. Bed linen was for a queen size bed. We had a king size bed!! Most of the time we got no bottle water for cleaning the teeeth or drinking. No colorful bed spread. The brochure and the webside looks fantastic but none of them was there. No extra bedding for the night because it was sometimes cool. Too much noise from other ruede guests with no manner which came home between 4am and 5am in the morning and talked for one hour in front of their room. We asked for another room, no answer. Asked for another mattress because it was like you are sleeping on a stone. We called to the front desk and got promised they will change it, nothing was happen during our stay. Sofas in room were dirty and damaged.Bathtop curtain was to short and the bathroom was allways flooded after taking a shower.Food serviceFrench Gourmet - nice presentation but no seasoning, very bland and no taste.Sakura Japanese Restaurant - the cook was from the Dom. Republic. Needs no explaination.Palapa Grill Seafood Restaurant - Grilled fish overcooked, dry and fishy.Lunch Buffet - not enough selection. Quality was not very special and no flavour. Nobody knew what's in the chafing dishes or on all the plate, because no labelling.Dolce Vita Italian Restaurant - some of the dishes were good.We never tried the mexican restaurant or the brazilBeverage ServiceFront Lobby bar - Very good in the night. Excellent bartenders.Beach Bar - very slowBar by Hibiscus Restaurant - very unfriendly and bad set up not guest friendly.We found only 4 bars and missing the other 3 which we read on the webside. Waitersfriendly but 70% spoke no english and was sometimes difficult to get the right thing. Head waiters from the restaurants to take the order mostly unfriendly - no smile.The landscaping was very beautiful and well groomed. All restrooms in Restaurants were nice and cleanIn all we paid for a 5*****Hotel and got 3*** Service. We are very dissapointed. We heard so many complaining during our stay and hope the took some time too to let them know.We were blinded with the wonderful brochure and the webside about this Hotel Paradisus. We travelled all over the world and had never such a bad experience.Two very dissapointed world traveller.BH

<Content>Paradisus Resort Great, but Watch out for Prieto Tours! If you are looking for a wonderful resort in a beautiful country the Paradisus is it. We loved everything about it. The service and food were great, we had no trouble getting chairs on the beach or eating in the restaurants. I would highly recommend this place to stay. I would like to warn those traveling to the Punta Cana area that we had certifiable theft by Chelo employed by the Prieto Tour Company. We have had no luck in getting resititution after contacting the company and just wanted to let those traveling in that beautiful area to be careful. Other than that, go have fun and enjoy this great resort!

<Content>Poor customer "service" ruined this vacation We are frequent travelers for both business and pleasure, and so have a lot of experience with which to compare this report. Although the beach and resort were lovely, this resort had the poorest customer service we have ever experienced. Although we specifically booked and paid extra for the 'Royal Service' what we received was quite the opposite. I can honestly say we have never been treated more poorly. We felt tolerated rather than welcome, and there were many times we felt like second-class citizens.A few brief examples: We were placed in an unrenovated room with construction going on in our building when many other rooms appeared to be available. Our request to be moved was declined (we were told that there was nothing available-although it was clear that some rooms were vacant!). So we awoke early to banging many mornings.Although there was a wine list at each meal, we were repeatedly told that whatever our choices happened to be (and we went down the list!) were not available. We were asked to chose between 'red' and 'white' and then were served the same two, poor quality wines. However, we watched other (Spanish-speaking) guests order from the list and different bottles from the list mysteriously appeared at their table. We were consistently not seen when asking for service on the beach (supposedly part of the royal service package), but Spanish speaking guests around us received excellent attention and service. When I went up to the beach bar myself, I watched as the bartender made me drinks without alcohol, and then insisted they were alcoholic. When this happened a second time and I said something, he laughed and turned to a co-worker and made some rude remarks in Spanish, assuming I would not understand. (I did not understand it all, but I am aware of the meanings of '----' and '----'. I assure you they are not complimentary).When turnign on a light in our room, I received a severe electrical shock and burn from the lamp, which had old and frayed wiring. When we told the customer service staff, they appeared unconcerned, and merely said they would remove the lamp (which they never did). No apology, no offer of medical attention for the burn, which kept me out of both the sun and water.I could go on, but in short, we felt like second-class citizens and were tolerated rather than welcomed. There were also obvious differences in the way Spanish-speaking clientele were treated. It is unclear whether language barrier difficulties (most staff, even those specifically in customer service, spoke no or very little English) contributed to this.My advice? The beach is absolutely lovely in Punta Cana. Stay at another resort. If, for some reason, you still want to go to Paradisus, absolutely don't pay for the upgrade of royal service. If what we got was royal service, I am afraid to guess how other non-royal guests were treated.

<Content>not such paradise at the paradisus 3 teenagers and 2 adults at paradisus, punta cana, last week in december 2005. the grounds are beautiful.that is the really good news. the not so great news is that i think they were overwhelmed with the big holiday week. the buffets were pretty much inedible. for the most part the staff was pleasant and friendly. mostly, we stayed on the beach from 8:00 am til around 5:00. the breakfast was very good, but it was buffet, so don't expect a nice hot breakfast. figure on lukewarm. the mexican restaurant was very good. i enjoyed the seafood, and most had chicken fajitas. this was probably a favorite for all of us. the chinese restaurant was very good, too. i had the lobster with ginger and leeks and although a little too salty for my taste, the lobster was plentiful and very good dish. the other's had chicken or shrimp dishes or vegetarian. again, all enjoyed their meals. at the italian restaurant we all liked our meals as well. we ate there twice. there are some real problems with the restaurant situation. first, the restaurants are all very, very small. there is limited seating in all of them. there are reservations in only 2-the french and japanese(we did not even attempt these). so, in order to get a table without having to wait an hour and a half outside a restaurant of your choice you have to get there early. restaurants open at around 6:30/7:00-not sure. now, the second problem is that even though reservations are not accepted at the restaurants, there is an exclusive group known as Royal Service that is very well treated-for a price! this includes reservations-which we found out by our third day-since we could not figure out how so many tables were filled up so early in the evening. i am not against exclusivity, but i wish paradisus/my travel agent would have mentioned this to me before we left. we learned that it would cost an additional $60 per day per person to have a few benefits-but we opted not to . we heard the steak house was good, but my husband felt a little leary about the meat because he had the steak on the second night and it did not taste like a ruth's chris steak, it just had a funny taste, so we did not go there. the buffet lunch was ok. we are foodies and i do expect a lot. i heard that the paradisus had good food and compared to some other all inclusive's we have been to, it wasn't that bad. the rooms were very tired looking and were in need of updating and some TLC. there were cobwebs in our closet and the ceiling in the bathroom leaked. we had two rooms for the five of us and both ceilings leaked. the toilet did not always flush and of course i made calls for these repairs probably two times for each and no one showed up. then the phone stopped working and i called from the other room and told them that they had to come immediately and they were there within one half hour. that was the only repair made. the rooms definitly need refreshing. the staff was friendly and pleasant for the most part. margarita, our waitress in the chinese restaurant was darling and she was a real treat. my masseuse at the spa was elizabeth pena and she was very good. i think this is probably one of the better all inclusive's in punta cana and a new paradisus opened this week as well, so maybe they are putting all of their energies into that one instead.

<Content>Nice resort but ....... I am surprised that we are rating this resort so poorly because it is actually quite a nice facility. Potential guests be warned that this is a big property. Those courtesy shuttle buses you read about are a necessity as walking back  forth between the lobby, accomodations and the beach gets old after the first day or so. Unfortunately there is no fixed shuttle schedule or routing around the resort and the drivers can be reckless at times. The property can also be confusing because the plantings are so lush and all roads look the same. My wife had a hard time figuring out whether she was travelling towards the beach or the lobby when exiting the room.The service at the front desk was not as good as it should have been for English speaking guests. We finally decided to only put in an effort to communicate over serious issues, simple requests just weren't worth the effort. We were surprised that it was a struggle to get a lock for our room safe, we supposedly got the last one on the property after many phone calls and hours after check-in.Room accomodations were disappointing. The rooms were big with marble floors but wall paint was badly scuffed and colours were depressing, heavy ugly curtains, furniture badly nicked and scratched, room fridge looked like it was falling apart and was not secured into the desk furniture. Clothes closet shelving made of poorly painted particle board. Definitely not five-star.Food and drinks were of good quality, although the buffet could hardly be called extravagant. This resort specializes in many different theme a-la-carte restaurants and most are seated on a first-come first-serve basis. We couldn't find food in the restaurants between 3pm-7pm and after 10 pm. Dinner was between 7pm-10pm. During the off hours you had to use room service, which was not always reliable. Service was very good at most restaurants and bars.The pool, beach and grounds are beautiful, the nicest we've ever seen and bug free. The lack of bugs was surprising because there's a large mangrove swamp in the middle of the resort. The entire resort was rather damp, I'd hate to see this resort in the rainy season.Lots of extra activities included such as horseback riding, scuba diving, snorkeling trips, boat excursions so there's no reason to get bored. Our major dissappointment in the resort was the Activity staff. They were friendly and sociable but didn't put much effort into organizing beach and pool games (the games were scheduled but nothing usually happened), and hotel souvenirs as prize winnings were far and few between. The Activity supervisor told us that people were too old to play games in this resort. This is the worst resort we have ever visited for enrolling guest participation.The hospitality accomodations for late departure guests was a horror story. For some reason the hotel staff use these facilities as washrooms. Besides the questionable sanitation due to high traffic, the facilities don't lock so my wife and I were constantly while showering and changing our clothes for departure. The most uncivilized hospitality facilities we have ever been subjected to.In closing, we went with an open mind but were disappointed, a decent vacation, but not a great one. Somebody's not keeping their eye on the ball here, the details are being dropped. They have enough managers running the place but we never met any, which is unusual in itself. I've never been at a resort where the manager doesn't make himself know to guests.

<Content>Just What They Advertised I just returned from this all-inclusive and I was very, very pleased. The most important thing to tell someone is that the resort delivers everything that it advertises. It was truly an all-inclusive in every aspect. Almost all water sports are included in the price of the trip. The equipment was plentiful and rarely did we have to wait to use anything. The food was very, very good. It was definitely geared to European, as well as American tastes. This added a variety that appeared somewhat strange at times, but there was always something very good to eat at every meal. The buffet was above-average, even by American standards. Breakfast consisted of made-to-order eggs, a variety of meats, both hot and cold, and pastry table, and much more. Lunch was delicious. We went to the grill which turns into a fish resturant at night. We were impressed with the variety of fresh grilled fish during the day, not to mention great burgers.Dinner was great...we didn't get to every restaurant, but there always seemed to be people raving and complaining about each. I guess it is a personal choice, but we found every restaurant had great variety and we were never disappointed. We didn't love the Japanese hibachi meal, but it was still pretty good!I thought the service at the entire resort was well above average. While there was a grumpy waiter here and there, most of the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. I recommend bringing $50 in singles to give small tips here and there. Although every tip is included, some of the staff were so endearing that they deserved a reward for their great effort. Remember, since this resort is not particularly geared toward Amercians, not everyone knows English. Most know enough to help you, and there is always someone around to translate. A few words of SPanish go a long way here and everyone ehom I spoke to in my broken SPanish seemed appreciative of my effort!My only real criticism was that the night life was a bit slow. The bars were great and were stocked. There was a show every night. The casino was small, but adequate (I won!)...the disco was empty! I suppose it depends on when you go, but people seemed to go to bed early!I would highly recommend this resort for groups of people who will entertain themselves. Also for people looking for a relaxing, stressless time. If you are looking for singles, great nightlife and wild times, this may be too tame for your taste.One more warning: The Sol Melia company that owns the resort seeks to sell time shares while you are there. The sales people are found in the common area of the main dinning facility. They strike up a conversation and make saying no very difficult. I hear the tour took over two hours of valuable sun time! We were forewarned and avoided it. I think it is unfortunate that they are so pushy about it, and I think it detracted from the ambience.All and all, I recommend this resort and believe it is good value for the price!

<Content>Paradisus Great Trip..honest review We had planned a trip to Rivia Maya, but, because of the hurricane we changed to Paradisus. My wife and I travel extensively and vacation twice a year in the carribean. We have never been a lover of all inclusive resorts, but, we heard so many wonderful things about Punta Cana and The Paradisus so we took a chance. Our taste in resorts is more for Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, so we went to Paradisus with some reservation.The Good:The resort it self was magnificent and very clean. The landscaping was extremely well taken care of, it was very lush and tropical. The facilities were very good and pretty much offered anything that you could imagine.The staff were some of the friendliest that I have ever encountered. Everyone was always smiling, and they could not do enough for you. Others have said they move very slow, but, in any island, it is not a faced pace environment. The retaurant choices were very good, offering pretty much everything that you could possibly want.The pool was big and clean, and had very well manicured lndscaping.The beach was gorgeous. White fine sand, and a clean ocean.The Not So Good:Much of the staff barely spoke english. As the Amercian tourist trade has not fully developed (more Europeans and South Americans), the english of the staff was marginal at best. Many did not even know basic english. I had to play charades alot with them. The property is enoumous, and in order to get from the main lobby down to the rooms you would need to take a little shuttle bus. The shuttles were few and far between and sometimes we had to wait 1/2 hour (most of the time we gave up and walked. The walk was substantial and after drinking or eating at one of the restaurants in the main lobby...you dont want to walk.As for the food...it was OK. You never really get fine dining in an all inclusive, so we were prepared. The Italian was good and the Japanese was good. The steak places sucked, and the El Romantico was fair. The buffets creeped me out, as most of the time you were never really sure what anything was. I guess it was catered more towards Europeans, as there were alot of weird looking stuff. The buffet for lunch had mostly what I would consider diner foods. No hamburgers or hotdogs or sandwich's to speak of.But, there was plenty of food, and it was OK..it served its purpose.We went to golf, and played at Cocotal one day. The course was nice, not great. It was very well manicured and in very good condition. Not very challenging, but, anytime you can play golf in the islands it is surely a treat. DO NOT GET ANY FOOD THERE. There were 4 of us, and 2 hadhamburgers and 2 had ham and cheese sandwich's, and all four of us puked the whole round.We golfed at Punta Cana Club one time, and this course was absolutley magnificent. I have played at some of the nicest golf course, and this wwould rival any course. 5 Ocean holes that were spectacular, and the 2 finishing holes rivaled that of Pebble Beach. The villas along the course were unbeleibale. Julio Iglsias lives there as does Oscar De La Renta. The course was about 6500, but, lots of sand, lots of water wholes and large ungulating greens. YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS COURSE. Cost is $140 which is greens fees and carts. Beware, they have caddies there that try to hook up with you. We took one, and it was a big mistake. Caddies are not neccessary and they dont keep there mouth's shut.Casino was cute. I am a gambler and didnt think that I would have too much fun in what seemed lik a make believe casino. The tables were $5 minimum and $100 max. I can honestly say we had a blast. Met alot of people, drank alot, and at the end of the night you lost or won $100. It was there just to have a little fun, and not to win or lose alot of $$.Royal Service:We took the royal service. It gives you a room closer to the beach, although none of the rooms were beachfront or had good ocean views. It gives you your own part of the beach which includes waiter service (tip the guy when you get there and he will pay very close attention to you, and come around alot. All day long he was bringing us packs of cigarettes and cold drinks). It also gives you access to a special lounge in which you can get internet, and they serve a nice breakfast, high tea, and hors doeurves throught the day. I would say if I waent back I would do the Royal Serviceagain, but, if you dont, it wouldnt be a big mistake.Tipping:Honestly they don't look for it..you dont feel like there hands are out after everything they do for you. But, they work very hard for you and a couple of bucks here and there should be no big deal. The really really appreciate it when you give it to them. We found out they work for about $250 a month and work up to 70 hours a week. If you tip, you will get some special treatment for sure. Children:This is not really a resort for children.I would have to say that I would go back. But, Paradisus is opening a new hotel Dec 20, called Palma Real. We passed it and saw pictures, it looks more like a 5 star facility..maybe I would try that, but, would definetly go back to Paradisus.P.S. Be cognizant of what you eat. DO NOT DRINK TAP WATER.

<Content>Disappointed in the hotel staffs behavior. The resort is beautiful and well kept. The room was comfortable. I enjoyed the international cuisine at the various restaurants, but that is where the problem was too. I spent five days there eating breakfast, lunch and dinner. I felt like I was in the deep south of the United States in the 1960's. Every Place I looked people were being served hand and foot with big smiles from the restaurant staff. Everyone but me and my party who happened to be African American and non Spanish speaking.We spent most of our time requesting the simple services it seemed everyone else was getting as a matter of course. It did not happen once or twice, but every time we went to eat. Complaining made no difference in the service. Other Blacks from the States told me they did not have this experience when they visited an all inclusive in Dominican Republic, but it certainly was mine.

<Content>A Paradise Home Away from Home! Our Family Just got back from the Paradisus Punta Cana Last night(Nov 26-Dec 3). My husband and I have traveled quite a bit to resorts in the Caribbean so I will write about how we would rate this resort compared to others. Our last holiday was in the Iberostar Maya Paraiso in the Mayan Riviera a truly 5 Star Resort. This is just my opinion to help others looking for a great resort...We had arrived to this beautiful resort and had upgraded to the Royal Service directly with the hotel by email before we left. They took us to the VIP Lounge (AIR CONDITIONED). They gave us a wet cloth to wash our face which was refreshing and a drink. Nice after a long plane ride but included in most 5 star resorts. Our Butler took us to the grill restaurant because our rooms were not quite ready. Never saw him again on the trip. More on the Royal Service later.Our family had 3 rooms in bungalow #1 closest to the beach. Nice, clean, I would not say the the rooms were outstanding but good. Location was great because the private beach for the Royal Service was a few steps away from our rooms. The beach is beautiful, sand is so soft and cool to the touch. Wide beaches with lots of chairs. You can take a walk down the beach for miles in front of other resorts. It is wonderful. One of my favorite beaches. Yes lots of topless women, but you can expect that with lots of European vacationers.The grounds are beautifully manicured. Lush tropical area. Very pretty.The food: pretty good. My picky family always found something to eat. The Hibiscus the main buffet was not big enough for the amount of vacationers. We where a party of five and always had to wait for a table. They seat you so they really didn't want to put tables together at first, they like to put you in smoking. Lots of variety of foods. Loved the roasted chicken, great omelets. You can also get great food from of the top of the swim up bar. Pretty good service there. The Seafood and Japanese restaurants we did not care for too much. Considering how great the Japanese restaurant was at the Iberostar Maya, the Japanese restaurant was very disappointing. Italian one was great, my hubby loved the lobster lasagna. The kids ordered pizza from room service a lot. We liked the Mexican Restaurant as well. We had heard that the steak house was very good but did not try it. The French one was very good as well. Compared to the Iberostar in the Maya this resort specialty restaurants was good but second to the MayThe beach bar was right beside the Private Royal Beach section. We are supposed to have drinks brought to us on the beach but there was only a couple days when the service was there. We just sat close to the bar and got our own drinks which was fine. The pool bar was a problem getting drinks unless you are in the pool and spoke Spanish. Very under staffed and bartender was rude. Casino - Very small. There is a large one just outside the property the Princess Resort. Shops on the resort a complete rip off. Never seen souvenirs so terribly priced. Lots of shops down the beach past the point and also on the main road when you drive to the resort.SPA Service: We all used the spa and found it very relaxing. Even the beach message is recommended.The resort is great for rest and relaxation. Families are there but not too many children to make it noisy. If you are single and a partier this is not the place for you.ROYAL SERVICE: IS ROYAL SERVICE WORTH IT?? I think that if you are looking for a room close to the beach then yes....as for butler service, fruit basket, drink service on the beach it is non-existent...I think that you can have a great time without it. They are building a new pool for Royal guests and that side is all under construction so construction walls are around the VIP rooms. When it is complete in several months this will be a nice benefit for Royal Service guests. Views are limited now. Room service was great. Very quick most times. The people working in the VIP lounge were helpful and did get things looked after. Was hard to get their undivided attention. They like to surf the net or multi-task while you are having a conversation with them. Mini breakfast is served here which is convenient but it is a smoking area in a closed environment so that part is not great. More choice at the main buffet. TIMESHARE: Lots of time share people outside the Hibiscus. Just say you are not interested and they leave you alone.SERVICE: I did find that the service of some of the people on the front lines was a lot lacking compared to other resorts. We did tip lots, brought lots of gifts and saw others discreetly tipping. I also believe that tips are for great service not to get great service. Maid service was very good, service in most of the specialty restaurants (except the Mexican) was also quite good. OVERALL: If you are going to Punta Cana we would definitely recommend this resort because even though the service was just okay, it is still a great spot. I am looking forward to the opening of the new resort. We saw the front gates but that is all. It is still scheduled to open on Dec 15. If you would like more information your welcome to send an email to me. Would be happy to reply. We have many pics on this resort and other resorts in Cancun before the Hurricane, Cuba and Jamaica.

<Content>picture perfect - wonderful time We were displaced from Cancun Mexico to the Paradisus Punta Cana in theDominican Republic due to Hurricane Wilma and were not disappointed. We were worried about our new location as we read many negative reviews.. Ihave now learned not to believe everything you read.Everyone has their own opinion, tastes and preferences.. If you can't beopen minded then I suggest you stay home. This is a tropical location youwill have to deal with the humidity and smells it is part of the charm. Ifyou don't like something then move on to another.. You will make yourholiday what it is.. Not the other way around.We were not sick throughout our whole trip.. We were careful not to overdueanything especially when you are sitting in the hot sun all day. All waterwas bottled and all the ice was brought in from the same distributor.. I didnot think twice to drink the water at the restaurants being poored out of apitcher as it was from the large jugs of water. Even the ice water in thewine buckets was taken from the large jugs of bottled water.. We did however use all the bottled water when brushing out teeth and we weresure to rinse our tooth brush with the bottled water as we were warned notto drink the water out of the tap.LANGUAGEWe only spoke a little bit of Spanish and we had no problems with the entirestay. Most of the staff speaks English and most speak it very well. We played one round of charades with an employee trying to find thewashrooms, but that is what made the trip that much more fun.I brought along a Spanish phrase book just in case and it turns out I didnot even use it.By then end of the week we had picked up a few sentences and were able toorder a few things from the bar no problem.All the signs included English, French, Spanish and Dutch so there was notproblem understanding.CHECK INQuick, painless.. Spent more time waiting to check in in hotels across theUS and Canada and we did not pay for the upgraded service.Lobby was fabulous.. the wood furniture was beautiful however the cushionscould you a makeover as they were a little old.FOOD- The a la carte restaurants were fabulous ( again it is a matter ofpreference) All the food was fresh and well prepared, there is more thanenough to select from on the menu. We dinned at the Italian restauranttwice, the Steak place twice and the Chinese, Japanese, Mexican restaurantsonce and found them to be wonderful.. We wish we would of had time for therest of them.. There are so many place to eat that there must be somethingyou will end up enjoying.- The breakfast buffet was very good. The only draw back was that some ofthe food such as pancakes and waffles were cold more often than not, howeverthere was more than enough to choose from so there was no way you were goingto go hungry.- Lunch was excellent, I recommend the Grill as there was such a wonderfulselection of fresh fish and wonderful meats.- We only ordered room service once and found it to be quick and tasty. Themenu was a little small but if you really wanted something different youcould easily walk and pick something up as the restaurants were open lateand they were not very far off.- The beach bar was very well located, I do recommend the Cuban sandwicheswhich were pressed on the spot.. They are a very tasty treat after a fewhours in the hot sun.-We found that the open air restaurants were a nice touch. Especially thelittle gazebos you can eat dinner in at the Italian restaurant.. Veryromantic.. The decoration and atmosphere of the entire eating area/pavilionwas fantastic. We found that it was well ventilated due to a very softbreeze running through.. Lots of candles made the evening very romantic.- We had a wonderful wait staff that were eager to please. More than oncedid they refill our drinks only after a few sips. We found them to be veryprofessional and attentive. They were very helpful when trying to figure outwhat to order.. And their selections were always wonderful. They were verykind and eager to chat without taking up too much of your time. Very nicepeople.BEACH-Picture perfect, exactly what I had pictured.. Palm trees, little thatchsun shades and great chairs.. Water front from impeccable and all sand..Very amazing- There was always many chairs to be had.. Never had a problem. Found themto be clean and comfortable. Funny how many people complained about thechairs.. If you find one that does not work.. Move on to another one.. It isnot that hard..POOL-Just think of a big lake with many islands.. Very clean and veryfantastic.. There were many places for private time or some fun especiallyat the bar.- The kids area was well placed further away from the adults.. Great if youwere looking for a kidless experience.-Pool bar was fantastic, we had numerous beverages of our choice. Iespecially recommend the Mudslides.. mmm.The staff were very professional and it is fun when they got to know youafter a week. They were always joking around and you could tell the enjoyedtheir profession.ROOMSAs for the rooms.. A little outdated. But what is outdated to us might befantastic to others.. So we did not think twice of it as we spend so littletime in our room.We had an electronic safe which was fine once I got it working... Weactually called security and they were more than happy to help.Overall, we were very happy with our stay and I do recommend this resort to anyone looking for a clean, manicured and fantastic place to stay.We could not of asked for moreHappy travels.C

<Content>Don't go Getting through the airport was a trip by itself; we filled out an entry form on the plane but there is another one that we have to fill out at the airport and then we have to buy a tourist card. Following local laws is one thing but at least they should post the entry procedures clearly and preferably in English so that we don't get the impression that we are being chipped away. Ground transportation by Hotelbeds was OK but an attempt was made to get us to go on tours that are included in our all-inclusive package. When we got to Paradisus, we were told that we have to spend a night at another nearby resort and come back to Paradisus the next day. A supposedly hassel-free vacation became a hassel from the getgo. Services at the resort was OK; but you probably can get it at any resort anywhere else. I should think that if they want to earn tourism money, it wouldn't hurt to learn to communicate in simple English unless the motivation was to deceive you in the first place. Hotelbeds sent a nice tour bus to pick us up for the airport as promized but the normally 25-minutes trip turned into a 90+ min ride on very bumpy road. We were simply glad to be leaving!

<Content>Almost Paradise, but not quite! First of all, don't let this review deter anyone from going to this resort. As all inclusives go, this was the most beautifully landscaped resort we had ever been to. It is simply gorgeous and very well maintained. We stayed there Nov 14th thru Nov 18th, and were one of the many couples switched from Cancun at the last minute. So we went into this not knowing what to expect. The beach was absolutely beautiful. It is made up of clean, white sand and there are plenty of lounge chairs to choose from even with the resort full. The ocean is also a beautiful blue/green color and the waves, although big, aren't really that rough. There is a bar on the beach so you can get cold drinks there while you tan. There are lots of women going topless on the beach, which kinda surprised me though. The pool is also very large and inviting and has a swim up bar, which is really nice. We only spent a few hours at the pool, because we loved the beach. The service at the resort was wonderful for the most part. We noticed, however, that we were the only ones tipping. I don't know if we just didn't see others tip, or if this was just an unusual occurrence. Upon check in, they did not explain what was included at the resort, (such as horseback riding, which we would have done if we had known about it). Since we had been switched here at the last minute, we had no idea what was included. I just wish they had taken a few minutes to sit us down with a cold drink and tell us exactly what was offered and the times that the restaurants were open and what they served. We didn't find out about the bar on the beach until our last day there. I know it was partially my fault for not asking questions when we arrived, so I'm not totally faulting the resort for that. Our main complaint about the resort, though, was the food. In our opinion, we didn't think the food and some of the mixed drinks were very good. But that's just our opinion, so don't avoid this resort just because of that. Things that you SHOULD be aware of at this resort are; there are tiny ants, very tiny ants, but lots of them, in the bathroom. No fan in the bathroom, but if you leave the window open, expect mosquitoes. The mini-bar in the room is only cool at best, and was never re-filled the entire time we were there. And there is no beach or pool waiter service at the resort, which I thought I wouldn't miss but it really makes a difference. Also, the tram that runs thru the resort to take you diferent places because the resort is so big, doesn't come around enough. Many times, we just gave up and walked. Even with the problems we had, we still gave this resort a 4 out of 5 rating, because we know that liking or not liking the food is just a matter of personal taste. The resort is beautiful, the service was great, the beach was fantastic, and anyone going to this resort is going to have a wonderful vacation.

<Content>A Top Notch Vacation We got diverted from the Mayan due to Wilma and felt like we were rolling the dice on this resort.....Not much time for research and frankly not a whole lot of last minute choices....We arrived 9:00pm and were checked in immediatly we did take the Royal Service upgrade and our consensus after the trip was it was worth the extra money (talk about that more later). Everyone comments on the grounds and they truly are beautiful. The beach is wonderful. They hand rake the see greass that washes up every morning so the beach is pristine. the constant waves are not a negative for us but we like body sufing and Boogie boarding so we loved all parts of the beach....Pool: spectacular....yes the water was warm but can someone please tell me how they could possibly keep it cool. It isn't that deep and it gets REALLY warm during the day. The pool is massive and ANYONE can find exactly what they want...privacy or companyRestaurants: An amazing range of food choices. If i was to rank them in order of our experienceEl RomanticaSteak HouseItalianSeafood Were all excellentChineseJapaneseMexicanWere good but not GreatWe did not eat at the BrazillianI was laughing as I read reviews of people compaining that they do not speak english at this resort. I never had ONE single conversation where I did not get my point across. I found almost EVERYONE's English to be excellent (Way better than my Spanish !!!!!). We also embraced the opportunity to learn a little Spanish and found all of the staff to be VERY supportive and VERY patient as they congratulated the good and corrected the bad with a big smile. The staff with one exception (out of the hundred or so we encountered) were responsive friendly and warm people. Their smiles melt your stress away. Royal Service: The cost is $120.00 a night (for two). We weighed the advantages against this cost and concluded it was worthwhile...here are some of the advantages:1) An air conditioned restaurant for breakfast. I found this a great way to start your day. A very peacful environment. Jose, Joan, and eddie made breakfast such an enjoyable time.2) The Royal Concierge Service: Any problem or request no matter how small all we had to do was call one number and it was looked after....Sparkling wine to the room. Reservations, excurtions. Early in the trip we thought this was over-rated but came to learn it had EVERYTHING to do with one individual. Once she went on her days off, everyone else was spectacular. Edgar, Ceasar, Isabella and all the others knew how to treat people so well3) The Royal Service has a seperate beach area....two advantages....Better lounge chairs AND Chair side service from the Grat Joel and Octavio....These guys would do ANYTHING for you. It got to the point where they prepared an ice bucket around 10:00am filled with water for my wife and Presidente beer for me. They would take food orders and bring anything you wanted. The ONLY problem we encountered in this beach location was the disgusting behaviour of other visitors who would order 3 times more food than they could eat....take one bite out of a burger and then throw it down and start eating something else. This we found to be not only disgusting, but also very disrespectful to our Dominican hosts4) Private check-in and check-out was okay but if it is not busy when you arrive or leave not really a big deal5) Internet access. Again no big deal for us as we were on vacation and didn't really need it but for those who enjoy, it is in an air-conditioned environment and very peacful setting6) Other nice touches....the room was dead close to the beach and all the retaurants. Had nice touches like a choice of special pillow and robes and slippers and other spoiling stuffoverall, I think that we concluded that the ability to have any concern or request dealt with right away and never being told anything is a problem made the Royal service worth the money. This of course will vary from person to person. Again, for us it was the people who made it such a wonderful experienceOther than that...the bartenders were great. Nicolas and Hector at the pool bar were great.....The lovely lady at the burger and fry hut was such a great person to meet. She greeted my wife and I whenever we saw her with a smile and a hug....We loved the Paridisus and we will be back as soon as we can

<Content>Paradisus, best all inclusive we've been to!!!!! a totally relaxing fun vacation!!!!!! excellent food. we were eating even when we weren't hungry!!!! glorious beach and pool. very few of the staff speak english, but it posed no problem. it was actually fun. they bent over backwards to make everyone happy. this is a large property with a 5 minute shuttle service, so it was easy getting to any part of the resort. the weather was perfect. rained one day, but we spent the time in the bar as did everyone else. never laughed so much in my life. as americans, we were in the minority. many germans, swedes, latin americans, brits, french,etc. everyone got along great even with the language barrier. we were surprised at the number of kids. all were behaved, no problemo! there are alot of kids activities and i didn't see one bored kid the whole week (oct. 22 thru oct. 29-2005). we can't wait to go back again. :-----)

<Content>Paradisus is Paradise We stayed at the Paradisus on our honeymoon from October 3rd to October 10th, 2005. We had a wonderful time. Before booking our trip my husband and I did several reviews of the Paradisus and wanted to gain some insight on what others thought of the resort. The only negative comments we could find is the service wasn't all that great and neither was the food. We completely disagree. The service was excellent. We were waited on the entire trip. I don't think I went a minute without having my drink refilled or anything else I needed. The bartenders were fabulous and made excellent drinks. Definitely try the Mamajuana when you go!!! The food was also great. Definitely the dinners were the best part especially the French and Japanese restuarants. The breakfast/lunch buffet were good also.Our room was standard but very nice. We were only in our room to clean up before dinner and when we slept. We didn't feel the need to upgrade if we weren't going to spend time in our room. We were at the beach during the day and/or doing excursions. We did parasailing, swam with the dolphins at Manatee Park, went horseback riding on the beach, visited the markets and shopped. We also did alot of hanging out at the lobby bar, shows, and fun pub. The resort (s) are very International which we loved. We met people from all of the world. The beach and water were gorgeous. The waves were huge. They definitely were not boring. Language: I would suggest either having some Spanish background or patience. Not so much at the resort but definitely for cab rides or visiting the market, or leaving the resort. Many of the Dominicans do not speak any English. Luckily both my husband and myself had taken some Spanish in college and could pick up on some of the things they were saying. We found it fun, others might not have as much patience for that as we did. Entertainment: Absolutley fabulous. I watched five of them and loved them all!Important Note: Do NOT attempt to eat outside of the resort. Also, if you go in October be prepared for some rain.

<Content>We Can't Wait to Return What a beautiful resort! We seemed to pick a slow time to travel, as the resort was not very busy while we were there. The beach is the most pristine I've seen. We paid a few hundred dollars extra for the Royal Service, getting us a room close to the beach, a private beach, VIP check-in and access to a lounge with sit-down breakfast, afternoon tea, dinner appetizers and computers with free internet. Staffers were extremely friendly. Great landscaping. Food was great, though sometimes cold foods got warm quickly in the 90+ degree heat. One word of caution: the casino on the property is questionable.

<Content>Absolutely the Most fabulous resort in Punta Cana Okay, after reading all of the recent posts on this particular hotel I felt compelled to post my own review. I have visited several other resorts in Punta Cana and they do not even come close to the Paradisus. I have been to the Paradisus a three times over the past 5 years and every time I go I never want to leave. I am even getting married there in October and am bringing down 90 guests. When choosing where we wanted to get married there was no question about it we wanted the a wedding in paradise and the Paradisus is absolutely a paradise.Why do we love this place? The food is EXCELLENT!!! There is no way you can get tired you have ten restaurants to choose from-- I do not understand how people can complain.The staff is very friendly and they are always willing to do whatever it takes to make you happy. At our last stay a gardener climbed up a palm tree to cut down a coconut for my fiancee and I. There is no question about--at this resort your wish is a command.The resort is gorgeous and everyone works very hard to keep it that way.I felt a little perplexed about the comments about the heat--geez you are in the Caribbean in August the hottest month of the year and people are complaining about heat! I do not think that Paradisus has control of the weather if they did I am sure they would make it pleasant for everyone. If you want cool weather in August go to Alaska!!!The hotel rooms are lovely! You get a huge room with a sunken living room. I can assure you that if you love to read under a palapa on a beautiful beach--this is the place to go. Remember everything at this hotel is included!!

<Content>I was hoping to be Pleasantly Surprised .. but I wasn't After reading several reviews before my trip I expected Paradisus to be a bit less than paradise.. I must say that it wasn't as bad some made it out to be. Yes the buffet food is pretty foul and in my opinion they leave meats and cheeses out too much time in the heat (cheese taste pretty funky.. I'd stay clear of it .. and I'm a cheese-lover) but other than that the food in retaraunts was pretty good. However it's not that comfortable eating dinner in long pants in the excessive heat and humidity.. a few are air conditioned (Mexican and Japanese).. Service I thought pretty good apart from the one guy I caught scarfing down the chicken he was supposed to be serving (gross)... The beach and ocean were fantastic which was really the whole reason why I went.. I don't think I would return to this resort however.

<Content>HOT But very relaxing!!! The Dominican Republic has VERY hot and Very humid weather. But if you take a dip in the crystal clear beach water there, you cool off very easily. The resort is very well maintained and very well run. An army of landscapers are constantly working to keep the grounds looking perfect. Our room wasnt ready right away, so we were compensated with a huge King Size bed! It was great. The room was huge. And beautiful. The people working there are the friendliest people I've ever met. And the fact that some of them had trouble with English didn't really get in the way. The restaurants were ok. All restaurants were good, just some menu items were better than others. Everything, and I mean everything is included. I didn't think alcohol was included, but it was. That was great. This was my first 'all inclusive' experience. I LOVED IT! There is 24 hour room service which we utilized. Overall, i would say the only complaint I had was the heat, which was easily fixed by dipping in the ocean. A dip in the huge pool was good too. There is a swim up bar there! While there, make sure you take an excursion. There are tons of them. These are not included but are worth every penny. We took the Bavaro Splash excursion. It included driving a speed boat and snorkeling. It was $62 per person and was well worth it.

<Content>paradise, but not in the service we stayed for 2 weeks in this hotel, in our summer vacation (8/08/05 to 23/08/05). it麓s a nice 5 star hotel with all inclusive service. The rooms are good, rustic furniture and with many space. the gardens are marvellus, treated buy a army of gardeners (the gardens are really a paradise). The beach it麓s very good with many activitis to do (beach volley, boats) but make a advanced reservation...The restaurants: Romantico: novell cuisine, with a good service; Rodizio - not a very good one...; the japanese- very good; the seafood/lunch buffet- medium service, good food; the grill: excelent meat. The italian: Medium. Main Buffet- almost the same food every day, but with good quality; Chinese- one of the best, very much quality.Service - the housekeeping is very poor, same this is the bath towels that aren麓t in the room, (and they may by dirty), others is the Coffee thet is not avaiable, be sure to have some dollars, and things will go much better... General opinion- good 5 star hotel, with excellent gardens e fine beach, good quality food, good shows/activities at nigth, Medium casino, poor general service.

<Content>Great place to have fun or to relax!!! We spent 5 nights at Paradisus and it was a great experience. Service was excellent. Everybody is very friendly, they go that extra mile to make you feel great. The food in the different restaurants was excellent too. Although the food at the buffett is something I will not miss...it all looked good but the taste was not all that...to the point that I would bring a full plate to the table and I would only eat a quarter of my plate. Other than this its a great place for family or couples.

<Content>peaceful and incredible people There is no hotel I've ever stayed at with nicer, more amiable employees than this one. They're always smiling and cracking jokes. When visiting this hotel, one must know that two of the restaurants require reservations (El Romantico (French food) and Sakura (Japanese food)). And by the way, the snow white sand and aqua water are incredibly beautiful.

<Content>pretty cool 12 of us just returned from the paradisus in punta cana. Out of 12 only two got sick and then only slightly. don't let negative reviews turn you off. especially abot getting sick. I got sicker in the good ole USA eating at White Castle Hamburgers.The restaurants were pretty darn good especially the Japanese and the Mexican. Weather was excellent and the ocean devine! Please note that if you tip a couple of bucks you will be treated royally. These people make about 50 US a week and a few bucks helps tremedously. We tipped everyone and they got to know us. We really were taken care of. The bartenders knew us and would have a drink ready for us as we passed by. Apparently the Europeans do not tip as generously or at all. One French woman came up to me and told me that we Americans ruin it for everyone by tipping at these all inclusives. I responded to her by saying that it why I am sitting down and eating while you are still waiting for a table!!! The ATV trip was a blast and you should try it if you have a sense of adventure. You travel through the real Dominican Republic and its just a great day. Scuba diving was fare at best unless you take the trip to Catalina Island.

<Content>Better Than Ever! We have just returned from our third trip to the Paradisus in three years. It was truly better than ever! Although we have always enjoyed our trips, the improvements in facilities, service and food over the past three years is notable. Is this Miami Beach? Of course not, but that's one of the reasons we enjoy the Dominican Republic! It's not the US! People are happy here, they sing and dance as they work... yes, there is such a thing as Dominican time and it takes a bit of getting used to. If you like something a bit different, enjoy a beautiful setting, a fabulous beach and kind people, try the Paradisus!

<Content>Hockin on our Honeymoon My husband and I stayed at the Paradisus Punta cana from 5/30/05 to 6/6/05 for our honeymoon and after reading the reviews written on this website, we decided to book with the Paradisus anyway because you'll never find a resort with all positives and no negatives, and since we're the type of people that could have fun in a library (lol) we figured that we could make the best of anything. The grounds are magnificent!! The people there are always smiling. The entertainers are full of energy and always trying to make sure that everyone is having a great time! There seemed to be an excursion for almost everyday if you wanted to do that or if you wanted to relax by the beach and get a massage or by the pool, you could do that as well.You could learn salsa and merengue and go parasailing and horseback riding. Now the down side. If you don't speak fluent spanish, you could have a problem. Absolutely no one speaks fluent English. My husband and I both took up to Spanish 2 in high school and in college, and we were still struggling. We had the VIP package, (which I suggest if you are going to go to Paradisus and will explain in a bit) and even the extremely nice ladies in the VIP office had trouble understanding us. This made things like asking if the water was from the bottle or the tap very difficult and we're not sure if it was the water or the different type of cheese (not real Mozzarella) or just the different cooking that they use there but we were sick almost the entire trip. Now we knew that we could get sick because of the reviews here on Travel Wizard so we came prepared. We brought everything from Pepto to Immodium, to Tylenol Sinus and Allergy. Nothing would help us. Not to mention that the bathrooms had swinging doors that didn't stay shut, and so you had no privacy to be sick in. There goes the honeymoon!! lolThe few foods that we recognized and liked were the very same foods making us sick and by the time of the last 3 days of our trip, we couldn't wait for the airplane food. Also, out of the 7 or 8 restaurants that they had there, only one, the Italian restaurant, was open for lunch, except the buffet and just don't even bother! And it was the cheese on the pizza that was constantly making us sick. Neither one of us is lactose intolerent but there is something wrong with the food down there. We didn't go back to work when we were supposed to because we were sick an additional week and a half after we came home!It is very depressing if you leave the grounds because it looks like the country is at war. You might also see a little boy standing alone with no shoes on asking for money. This is a third world country and I never understood what that meant until I was there.But listen, if you've booked already, don't fret. I found out that if we would have brought Cipro with us that it would've taken care of our symptoms in no time. Plus, if you're going, make sure that you do the VIP package because it really is worth it. They'll bring you room service at all hours of the night which we did do. You also don't have to buy cigaretters once because they always have it behind the bars for free and room service will bring it to you. The more you tip, the nicer that they'll be. If you have a strong stomach and are not one to get sick, than hey, try it. However, if you know that you have bad luck or don't like trying new food, than this place is not for you. One out of every couple that we met was sick. Only one couple that we met didn't get sick at all and they said that they would go back next year and we have a feeling that it's because they're from Puerto Rico and so they could be used to the way they cook and the water.

<Content>This Resorts housekeeping sucks The housekeeping SUCKS at the Paradisus and the front desk people are rude and just don't care to help you...The food was ok but the buffet is definitely like a Golden Corral ( which sucks ). The rooms are ok...had much better rooms in Mexico...Don't spend your money on Dominican Republic there is nothing to do...if you like a little nightlife you will not like Punta Cana...Very 3rd world...We will never go back there again....spend your money elsewhere...

<Content>Great Value... ...But ultimately, a value. This resort was absolutely stunning with lush gardens, beautifally appointed Suites, long white sandy clean beaches, and a sparkling, big pool.The resort itself is massive, and there is a mass transportation service which is pretty much a golf cart train. Since it is relatively new, the staff have been able to keep up with the maintenance, and it shows. The native wild animals are cats, no rodents. The sky is large and gorgeous.The value part comes in with food and staff. If eating is not so important to you, then this resort woould be perfect. We stayed 6 nights, and we ate well only once, and that was at the chinese resteraunt. The staff doesn't really speak English, so bring your pocket translator. Drinks consist of Pina Coladas and Paradiso's, a kind of slurpee with alcohol. Don't expect 5 star food, it's more like what you'd expect at an Applebees, maybe even less.This is a family resort, so if you don't want to deal with kids, this is not the place for you, although I have to say that I met some fantastic kids who played volleyball with us and were very well behaved. Maybe because they were French- Canadian.Also, make sure to call many times in advance since they double book rooms, and when you get off the airport bus, rush to the counter to check in or you'll be waiting for an hour.I would go back there again, just for the beaches and the rooms. Food is important, but ----, those beaches are beautiful. Just don't go off the resort, because there is so much poverty it's depressing to see on your vacation. Same goes for any of the off- resort activities.Enjoy.

<Content>Returning to Paradisus in August This resort is worth every penny. Is this resort comparable to a 5 star hotel and a 5 star restaurant in say New York City? No, but I think it is probably one of the nicest all-inclusive resorts that you will find. There is such a wide selection of food available that you will not have a problem finding things that you will enjoy. There is also some top shelf liquors available at the bars. There is plenty to do if you are up for snorkeling, water sports, beach barbeques, horseback riding, swimming, shows, gambling at the casino in the evenings or you can simply relax in the sun at the pool or the beach. There is plenty of lounge chairs available for everyone and the pool is huge with plenty of private space. The grounds were well manicured and the staff was usually very friendly and helpful. The resort is huge and well spread out. If you are not up for some long walks around the complex you can use their shuttle service to help you get around. The only thing we found annoying about this place was the staff that was strategically placed at the resort that would stop you in your tracks on a regular basis trying to pressure you into visiting their sister resort and trying to push their time shares etc. on you. Eventually we had to just flat out ignore these people. As soon as you hear where are you from? or how long are you staying here? from a stranger that stops you in your tracks, prepare yourself for the hard sale. If you like rum drinks be sure to try the coco loco (rum mixed w/ coconut juice) served in the coconut. This drink is yummy and refreshing. Make sure to order one early, because they run out of coconuts early in the day.

<Content>Not worth your money I just came back from a 5 day stay. Its not a 5 star hotel. Really, if you are looking for a nice hotel, great service and the ammenities go somewhere else. The food is so, so ...if you go to the buffets but the Japanese and French restaurants are awful, really. I cant believe that such a prestigious resort chain would do such a poor job in running a hotel in beautiful punta cana. The staff is very courteous though. Its a 3 star hotel. Not worth the price at all.

<Content>Great place to visit! I just returned from the Paradissus Resort in Punta Cana on June 16, 2005. I was concerned before I left after reading some of the reviews online. If you're expectations are set, you will LOVE the resort as we did. The entrance is beautiful, open and spacious, and you are greeted with island, non-alcoholic drinks before checking in. Our room was above our expectations, very clean and spacious with a marble bathroom. If you're going to relax and unwind, this is the place to be! The pool is great, not crowded at all, and the swim-up bar opens at 9am! The one thing you need to keep in mind is you're probably only paying a few hundred dollars a night for room, food, tips, and alcohol... so the food is not 5 star but it's good. The best restaurant is the French, El Romantico, which we had no problem making reservations in once we arrived. This is the best restaurant in the resort by far, and exceeded our expecatations. The other restaurants we're good, but not exceptional. We had no problems with food or water at the resort, our in-room minibar was always stocked with bottled water. Everyone is very friendly and outgoing, and although most of the staff speak Spanish, they know enough English to understand you and help. The beach is beautiful, and there are many free activies to do on the beach and ocean. Plus, for extra money, there is another suite of activities. We did the free snorkling trip; a boat took us out into the ocean and we could snorkle for about 45 minutes at a reef. And if you're going soon and looking at weather and it says rain, it only rained one day while we were there. Some days were sun all day and other we're sun and clouds, which was perfect since the sun is SO hot. I think anyone who is looking for a good time at a beautiful resort will love the Paradissus - we've already recommended family and friends! Have Fun!

<Content>Fantastic Resort We were at the Paradisus Punta Cana from June 15th - 22nd. What a great deal for a resort with such great choices of food  gorgeous beach. Buffet was wonderful - a la carte restaurant wasn't bad. 24 Hr room service was great for my family since I have 2 kids who are always hungry in the a.m. Staff is very friendly but time share salesman were annoying. Would definitely return in the future.

<Content>Don't believe anything you read or half of what your hear We recently came back from this resort. It is advertised on the Sol Melia website as being fully renovated, which it hasn't been touched in eight years and is in need of a complete overhaul. The food is mediocure at best, 11 restaurants, only three or four open each night, beach chairs moldy and streached out, dirty beach, mildewed rooms, worn fabrics and furniture in rooms, mini bar not stocked or cold, disagreeable staff, bad service and bugs in the rooms. AA Vacations website states this is a five star property. We would rate it -5 stars. Royal Service is a joke, don't dare pay extra for it, you will be sorry, extra money for nothing, and don't drink the water.

<Content>Great value for money Stayed here for a week in early June, it was the start of the rainy season and when it rains, boy does it ever!! Anyway on to the resort, rooms were spacious and kept very clean, all the service staff were exceptionally friendly  helpful. Some restaurants are closed on certain nights, but there are always plenty of signs around indicating this. The biggest plus for me was the free scuba diving, at least 2 dives a day, sometimes more, with ScubaCaribe, a very professional and knowledgable operation. I can highly recommend this resort and would love to go back some day.

<Content>Just a great as 2004 Paradisus Punta Cana May 2005For starters, we were there in April 2004. Some of this report is a repeat from 2004鈥檚 report since there wasn鈥檛 much changed, but there are some additions. Air travel: Living in Niagara Falls NY, we usually travel out of Toronto, Ontario. The flights are non-stop and the Canadian exchange is nice too. This year when we booked with Air Transat Holidays we upgraded to Club Transat. Major difference and I would highly recommend it. Seating was 2-3-2 in very roomy leather seats compared to the 3-3-3 cramped seating in the remainder of the plane. Also the fast Club check in both at Toronto and Punta Cana really made the upgrade more than worth it for the fee. * Don鈥檛 forget you鈥檒l need $20 US CASH per person for departure tax from Punta Cana. * We took a cab from the airport to the resort instead of waiting for the resort bus. The cab was only $22 US plus tip and we got there in about 25 minutes. Taking the bus you have to wait for all the other persons to get their luggage, get signed in and then you have to make to rounds to all the resorts for drop off, not just yours. All depends on your budget and patience either to choose the cab or not. Resort check in: We chose the Royal Service and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Upon arrival to the resort we were taken to the Royal Service offices for check in. We arrived around 2:30 and by the time we finished our paperwork and some catch up with the staff our rooms were ready and we headed to building #30 as we had requested.  Bungalows: These are16 unit buildings, 8 to a side, 4 up  4 down. Get 2nd floor if possible; more private and has vaulted ceilings. Also try and get the corner rooms. Their balconies wrap around the side of the buildings so you actually get two views. The rooms have a large bathroom with a separate room for the toilet and Jacuzzi tub/shower. It also contains the closets, safe, ironing board and full length mirrors. Next is the king-size bed, nightstands and dressers. Then two steps down is a sitting area with chairs, table and desk. TV is located on a ledge between the two areas so you can either watch in bed or in the sitting area. From there you lead to the balcony and a perfect view. Royal Suites are on the beach so your view is wonderful. Of course the whole resort is so beautiful and well maintained that garden view is just as great. Restaurants: Seemed that the crowds started around 8:00-9:00 pm. Hibiscus International Buffet. Nice selection, very fresh, made to order pasta bars. Plus large range of meats  seafood. Very nice for a more casual breakfast, lunch or dinner. Marino Seafood: Dinner. Outside patio facing the beach. Lobster with lime was amazing. Service always smiling. Dolce Vita (Italian): Lunch  Dinner. Starters were usually Capri salad (tomatoes and mozzarella) which was very fresh plus they brought tomato brushetta and garlic bread to the table. They have great thin-crust pizza with about any imaginable topping. Service was fast and fun although the restaurant is too lit for dinner IMHO. Pavilion (Chinese): Dinner. Starters of dumplings were great. Service was nice.La Romantico (French): Dinner. Had the Risotto for the main course, very nicely done. For dessert order the crepes. Don鈥檛 forget your cigars. La Albufera (steak house): Didn鈥檛 do this time. (See 2004 report for details). Rodizzio (Brazil): Didn鈥檛 do this time. (See 2004 report for details).Antojitos (Mexican): Dinner. Great food and wonderful, fun service. Taco/salad bar for starters had a nice variety and very tasty. Watch out for those peppers though, HOT.Sahura (Japanese): Hibachi seating with about 12 persons. Started with appetizers, then soup and a choice of various dishes with chicken, seafood or meat. All meals were well done (chicken a little over done) and the service was very good, although a bit conservative for a Hibachi chef (usually they are quite flamboyant!). The deep-fried ice cream for dessert definitely needs some work. La Palapa: Lunch: Always seemed overcrowded and the food always looked picked at and not very hot (temperature wise). Staff tries their best but with so many persons, they are way outnumbered. We always opted for the Hibiscus or La Dolce Vita for lunch and never had to wait and were always pleased with the selection and service. BreakfastHibiscus: Large buffet with made to order eggs, pancakes  waffles. Also yogurt, cereal, fruit, pastries and all the usual sides (bacon, sausage鈥?Pool: It was large, clean and had many little alcoves for floating and relaxing. Always enough chairs and palm umbrellas for everyone. Pool bar is both upper (out of pool) and lower (in pool) and those guys hustle. Beach: Long, clean and beautiful. We would walk a few times everyday from one point to the other. Seemed to go on forever. From our walks I can say that the Paradisus beach is one of the cleanest areas. The crews are out every morning around 6:30 am raking and there is always some persons walking around during the day picking up glasses, cigarette butts and such. * There were issues regarding the beach chairs. Since I am an early beach walker (5:30 am) and usually on the beach for the start of the day by 7:30 we never had any troubles. But those coming out late mornings, did not always find the shady spots that they were hoping for. * At the left end of the beach, around the turn, are a collection of vendor shacks. You must take the walk to see the deals. Coffee, clothes, sculptures and other souvenirs can all be found and haggled for. Grounds: The grounds at the resort are amazing. So lush and green with flowers and trees everywhere. The maintenance crew is always working on something and it shows. We were really surprised that for a resort of such size just how clean the grounds always were. No cigarette butts, empty glasses or any other debris anywhere. There are also flowing ponds stocked with Koi (bring a roll from breakfast and they will love you) and beautiful statues throughout the resort.  Royal Service: We chose the Royal Service and I would highly recommend it to anyone. From the moment we booked our trip I was in contact with Mariana, the Royal Service Manager and she was wonderful. She took care of our room requests (we were 2 couples and wanted to be near each other at the resort), made all our dinner reservations before our arrival and even offered to book our golf times ahead for us. The Royal Service lounge offers free internet access, daily newspapers and an assortment of books and movies. They also have a wonderful little restaurant that we used for breakfast everyday. The variety was the same as the larger Hibiscus but much more personal service. You can get beverages there all day long including espresso. Also, they have appetizers and cocktails before dinner starting at 7:00. Royal Service guests also have a reserved spot on the beach and have waiter service for its guests in that area. There wasn鈥檛 anything that you couldn鈥檛 ask of the staff of the Royal Service. They were highly efficient, very knowledgeable and still the nicest persons you could ever meet. Manager Party: Outside the Main Lobby in Wednesdays starting at 7:00. Loads of food and drinks and a great opportunity to meet the managers and discuss the resort.Beach Party: Saturday nights. Fun on the beach with games and grills!!My Webshots page for photos: http://community.webshots.com/user/lisa490Any questions, you can email me directly at LSUSKO@AOL.COM.Lisa S

<Content>This is not a luxury resort My girlfriend and I went to Punta Cana last week (Early May '05). Just a small background, I have a small business and I travel extensively. I鈥檝e personally visited 15+ countries and stayed in some excellent resorts. Also I am half Dominican.Paradisus is one of those all inclusive resorts without a management team that emphasizes service. I will get back to service in a second and tell you the positives about the resort. They have amenities such as a great pool, a lovely beach front, random fun activities such as a batting cage, horseback riding and some very nicely manicured grounds. The staff at the Paradisus are very gentle people. All country type folk from the adjacent city of Higuey. Spanish speakers are at an advantage in the resort because their English isn't what it should be. Most resorts in the Western Hemisphere demand that their staff speaks English. Paradisus doesn't from what it appears. Now to the service. We requested early check-in due to the fact our flight came in at noon and check in is at 3. We arrived only to find our room wasn't ready. After a long conversation the front desk mentioned they would look to see if an equivalent room was would be available and to sit in wait. We waited 2 hours, and then at 2:55 our room was ready. So I guess my early check-in meant saving 5 minutes.Once showered (Medium tempetured water appeared the warmest we were able to get) we walked the grounds and went to the pool. At the pool (as in the beach) their isn't roaming drink service. You literally have to go to the bar. In the pool that is not a problem because their is a bar in the pool. The beach on the other hand makes you walk 1 -2 city blocks to go to the bar. And, unfortunately the bar is in a restaurants and their policy is no shirt no service. Very inconvienient.Speaking about the restaurants each is at best mediocre. The two worst are the buffet and there French restaurant (which you need to make reservations for) called El Romantico. My girlfriend and I attempted for 3 days to get reservations at El Romantico thinking nothing could be worst then the buffet. We were told by one of the concierge to go to the front desk to make reservations. We walked approximately a mile because the bus service hadn't come. When we reached the front desk, we were told to walk back to another concierge and they would make the reservations for us. I was livid and said it's it's a reservation, why can't we call. Unfortunately back to the service issue, we were turned away. Sadly, we got back to the concierge at 4pm on the dot and reservations were closed which made no sense. After complaining in Spanish for 15 minutes they amazingly found a reservation for us at 9:30. To my chagrin I ordered the steak and it tasted like fish and I ended up getting a stomach bug.The next day we went horseback riding. It was nice even though we were with a group from 2 resorts, approximately 20 people. No individual service.We met many couples all seemed very similar in their opinion of the service at the resort and the quality of the food. A couple complained how the staff always tried to sell you time share in the adjacent lot. At the beach staff would walk showing you schematics with possible pricing. It was just not a classy thing as you're sunbathing.All in all, I鈥檇 go to the other side of the island (Boca Chica or La Romana). They have more developed resorts with more of a view on luxury.

<Content>Loved the resort Just returned last night after 5-day stay at the Paradisus. The resort is beautiful, the people are really nice and service awesome. We upgraded to Royal Service and thought is was totally worth it. Check in and out were quick in the VIP lounge. Got a corner room on the 2nd floor with view of the ocean. The room was clean with maid service twice a day, champagne and fruit baskets at night. Saw a few mosquitoes and got a few bites but all went away the next day. Would definitely recommend bringing mosquito spray. The food was fine, the drinks were great and we weren't sick once. We ate breakfast at the RS lounge every day and used to RS beach (had drink service which was really nice). We ate at the seafood restaurant (my husband says the lobster was great), the Italian restaurant, the Japanese restaurant, and the French restaurant. We liked the food and had no complaint. We enjoyed ourselves and would highly recommend the Paradisus.

<Content>reality The truth about the this hotel is this... The landscape of this hotel is beautiful, palm trees, flowers; everything is taken care of and some. The beaches are nice and relaxing. The food is ok. There are 8 restaurants and I will rate them (bad 1- 10 good). Chinese 6, Japanese 4(not true hibachi) French 3 nice environment weird food, Italian 7, steak house 9, Mexican 8, brazil 7, seafood 8. Buffet is garbageTheir casino on the grounds is a joke, theirs 12 slots and six tables, but theirs is a big casino directly outside of the hotel (1 min) much better, and theirs a small club inside also. The club at the hotel is a 10 by 10 room called the fun club...not fun. The only entertainment besides the room and the casino is a show every night. If you鈥檙e not into dancing then it sucks. For kids its seems good, they have rock climbing, batting cages, numerous water activities and the pool is amazing. The pool is very big and beautiful the only thing that鈥檚 stinks is the pool is so hot that you sweat in the pool (sometimes)Ohh and if you plan on getting VIP service don't its a waste of money.I had a good time in Punta Cane but the island is an under developed country the looks like crap outside of the resorts with garbage all over and contraction everywhere. My advice is Punta cane is a place to visit in ten years when everything they鈥檙e building now is complete and it doesn't look like a war zone. Pay the extra bucks and go some place else.

<Content>Don't let the bad reviews scare you!!! Well we just returned from the Paradisus, we stayed from April 9-16th and I have to say all of those bad reviews left us very worried. And NONE of them are true... I really believe those reviewers are NEVER satisfied.First the grounds are absolutely beautiful  so is the beach.The rooms are nice as well, I'm sure some are better than others, we did get the upper corner unit that we requested but unfortunately it faced the next resort, (not the view I was hoping for, but nothing to complain about!!!) and it was still quite pretty to sit outside.The food is not the best, but you won't starve or get sick as others have said. But there are many choices... the Japanese was fantastic (great steak) and the Grill  Buffet had a decent lunch  the Steak restaraunt was also nice.If you are looking for a party or to take in a lot of excursions, this is not the place. This was mostly an older crowd with a very laid back  low key atmosphere... it was a beautiful getaway. You will get plenty of rest, relaxation  sun. Go and have a great time!

<Content>Best Vacation Ever We just got back from our trip at the Paradisus Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Let me just say, this was by far the best trip my husband and I have ever had. We went to the Sandals Resort in Montego Bay, Jamacia for our honeymoon and it was awful. I don't recommend going there. The Paradisus defintely didn't compare to a Sandals Resort. Every single thing we did there from the activities to the restaurants even to room service was absolutely wonderful. We had no problems with anything. Our room was absolutely breathtaking, with a view of the sea. Every single person on the staff at the resort that we encountered was very, very friendly and helpful. We couldn't believe it. We had gotten the Royal Service and defintely thought it was worth the money. We were going on vacation to relax and be pampered and that's exactly what we got. The weather was perfect, the food was wonderful, the beach was spectacular and very clean. I would say overall the whole property was clean and very, very well taken care of. The property was absolutely gorgeous all the way around. I can't actually think of one thing to complain about. As with anyone that probably read all the reviews on this website that were negative, we were very scared to go here, but all of our worries were quickly laid to rest once we stepped foot on the property. If anyone has any questions or would like any advice, feel free to contact me and I'll help in any way that I can at mistywang@yahoo.com. One more thing, we did tip quite a bit here and there, because we wanted to, we certainly didn't need to, the service was by far the best without tipping.

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful! Ok, Ok....I've read enough bad reviews of various properties in Punta Cana (including the 5 and 6 star ones G). But I wanted to add a touch of realism here....Punta Cana (at least for now) is a destination known for it's absolutely spectacular beaches, all-inclusive resorts, mediocre but plentiful food and fun-in-the-sun activities. You won't find shopping malls or many off-site touristy excursions. But if you simply want to go somewhere and hang out on a splendiferous beach and just chill, then this is the place for you!If you require constant activity, children's programs or 5-star gourmet dining, then you will NOT (repeat after me...NOT) enjoy Punta Cana.Be that as it may....I went there to simply get away and relax. And, after being told that the Paradisus resort was the ultimate place to stay here, I booked my trip. The Paradisus has just about the most spectacular grounds that you can hope to find in Punta Cana. Where some of the resorts have spacious and well-laid-out grounds that are only minimally landscaped....the Paradisus almost seems to be a Garden of Eden....pretty much overflowing with flora (maybe a little fauna too G). In fact, I've never laid on a beach with the scent of tropical flowers wafting over the sand before....but I have NOW!!! The food, as many have mentioned before, is just not going to be 5-star. Just picture a more deluxe buffet version of Ryan's or Golden Corral (with definite international flavor) and you'll get the picture.So basically....go to Punta Cana for the beaches and don't expect the very best food in the world! But you won't go hungry. And I obviously figured that, if this was true of the 6-star Paradisus, it could only be MORE true at lower rated resorts. There were plentiful beach activities available here, from parasailing to various types of boats for rental. We enjoyed a trip up the beach on some type of motorized craft that gave us a nice feel of the area. You'll be able to take a taxi to a market or two, buy some cheap souvenirs, but don't expect lots of activities offsite. Also, do not expect many of the locals to speak English. But this is not really a problem. The rooms at the Paradisus were very comfortable, not what I would call exceedingly plush, but quite nice. Please heed the various warnings about the strength of the sun here. This ain't Florida folks...so slather on the bigtime sunscreen.One last thing.....I can't say enough about the beauty of the beach here. I stayed 4 nights but never totally got over the awe of getting my first glimpse every day when I walked from my room to the beach....walked over a little rise and there was THAT VIEW spread out before me.This has to be one of the most breathtaking beaches in the Caribbean.Whatever shortcomings these various resorts may have....they will all fade into the far recesses of your mind when you see the beach.

<Content>March 24-29 Visit to Paradisus We just returned from our trip to Paradisus. The trip was great and the weather was perfect. The Paradisus is definitely not a 5 star hotel, however it's nice. We happened to have a room that needed a little renovation, but my son and his wife had a room which was a bit nicer. The beach is beautiful. We found the food to be good with no complaints there. If you're basically going to relax and enjoy the sun you'll be very pleased.

<Content>Rest and relaxation If you don't golf ... You can enjoy the beach or the pool all day if you like! A swim suit for the day and dressy casual for the evening. The food was wonderful, the people friendly. It is a very poor country, so a few dollars here and there for service warms the heart beyond belief. We had a wonderful time.

<Content>Decent, not as good as Sandals We visited Paradisus for 5 nights in mid March, 2005 and while we enjoyed our stay, I can say it is not worth the $325 per night we paid.Before I say negative things, let me state this: it was a very nice resort and we had a good time. Needless to say, if you're planning a honeymoon or a special vacation and are ready to drop a lot of money on the trip, just beware of a few things:1- The resort is European owned. The food and the buffets are not geared to American tastes. I would rate the food quality as good, similar to what you'd see on a cruise ship. 2- The beach is very nice, but the neighborhood is lousy. Don't expect to see many sights--the DR just doesn't have much to see or look at. So you'll probably hang out in the resort most of the time.3- There are more things outside of the resort to do in places like Cancun, Cabo, etc. The DR is a relatively new destination so don't expect to be able to hop a cab and visit other restaurants, bars, and entertainment off the resort property--there's nothing around the neighborhood.We live in the midwest and the flight was long for what I would consider an average resort with average food. If you're mainly going to relax on a beach, consider closer places like the Bahamas or even Key West.If you are convinced you want to go for an all inclusive stay, Sandals is a much better resort. That said, I would return to Paradisus, but only at the right price, say $200 per night.

<Content>Great Pool Just got back from Paradisus and had a great time. The pool is huge and offers a very cool swim up bar. Our first day was kind of rainy and cloudy but that didn't spoil our good time. Paradisus is a great place if you are looking for somewhere just to chill out and relax by a pool or on the beach. I'd say it was probably 40% American and about 60% European. The service was above average but you just need to be patient because the hotel workers are expected to speak several different languages (English, French, German, and Spanish) which they do quite well. Paradisus doesn't exactly have a great night life so if that is what you are looking for I'd suggest you go elsewhere. There is a small casino and a small disco on the grounds that are open till about 4 AM. My biggest suggestion is to bring and abundance of $1 dollar bills for tips. The service is good but seems to get better when you tip. It is not easy to make change so I'd bring it yourself. If you're a smoker they'll hook you up with free Marb Lights or Regulars at the bar. Just ask and they'll give you like 5 at a time. If you tip they'll usually set you up with free packs. My fiance and I would definitely go back. Don't set your expectations too high and you'll be fine. The food is fair but I didn't go to the DR expecting great food. Good Luck.

<Content>Buyer Beware My husband and I are in the midst of planning a vacation for the summer of 2005. We recalled our experience last year at the Paradisus and must share with you the truth about what you may experience. We have previously vacationed in St. Lucia and Cozumel and know that there is Caribbean time to factor in. We vacation to relax by the ocean, pool and enjoy our accommodations. The beach was very nice. This was the first resort that we visited with a swim up bar. Our first day, we saw a man vomitting into the water as he sat at the bar drinking. We were immediately turned off and never went in the pool again. I realize that this is not the resorts fault but still a turnoff.Why we spent a fortune to come back home early: After our first meal, we both had diarhea within 30 minutes. This process continued after everything we ate. By my third day, I was down to bread for my meals. My husband kept trying to find something. On the fourth day, well after we had lunch and in the process of getting ready to try another restuarant for dinner, my husband began to violently vomit. That was the last straw for us. We contacted our travel agent and paid flight fees to come home early. The resort was sympathetic to our situation and offered mentioned it was the coconut oil they cook in. They did offer to cook meals at our request but this is not the point of an all-inclusive vacation where you can drink and eat at your convenience. When we arrived home, we continued to experience symptoms for over a week and visited our physician who had to take stool samples and test for parasites.Please be careful when/if you go and if you can afford to go elsewhere, please do. Your stomach will thank you.

<Content>Went there for our honeymoon First, a Caveat - if you are a Scuba Diver, DO NOT GO HERE especially in the winter months. We chose Paradisus Punta Cana thru a travel agent who associates with Vacation Express. Let me first state that this type of all inclusive with airport transfers and airfare included as charter is a great way to plan a vacation. We had not before done an all inclusive vacation, and even the cruises you go on you have to pay for alcohol and drinks so they are not comparable.The resort itself: Very impressive! Beautiful grounds, well maintained, the pool and common areas all very nice and impressive. You get a 4-5 star feel from the moment you come into the enormous open-air lobby.The food: Very impressive. We read reviews before going and were concerned, but found the food to be very well prepared, abundant and much choice. A tip: YOUR FIRST DAY make sure to go immediately to the desk beside the bar in the restaurant cluster and make reservations for the Japanese and French restaurants, or you will not get them. They go fast-we arrived on Mon. evening and waited until Tues. evening (when we finally found the place to sign up) and were lucky to get res. for Fri. and Sat. night. We ate at all restaurants except the Chinese and Mexican (we eat enough of those at home) and found them all to be great. We went back several times to the Seafood one - great lobster. Also enjoyed the Brasilian, Steak, and Italian very much. We never ate at the buffet for dinner, but did several days for lunch and enjoyed. Breakfast was pretty good - the custom omelette station was great and the fresh fruit smoothies very good.Drinks: You must have COCO LOCO's. They are fabulous and you will be hooked immediately.The staff: Very good, except...the only drawback to the resort (and most likely every other Sol Melia property) is the INCESSANT TIME SHARE PUSH! Best advice - when you first check in they take you over with a drink and make an appointment for you to go see the other properties close by. We made the mistake of not being firm with them, and they hounded us for several days. They don't speak English very well, a lot of them, and will call and call to schedule and reschedule even when you tell them you are not interested. BE FIRM and tell them in the beginning you will not have any interest in any appointments...maybe that will be effective.Otherwise, all staff seemed to be very friendly. The maid services often didn't leave all the towels, and sometimes there were no cigars at the bar (my husband took advantage of that being part of the all inclusive - they are supposed to have hand rolled cigars available each day, but the supply was not always there) but that's why it's a 4 instead of 5 star kind of place.The Scuba Diving was dismal. Scuba Caribe is the shop onsite, and they are horribly inefficient. We sort of knew in advance from reviews that Atlantic diving in the winter might be sketchy, but after having paid for a resort that was to have unlimited diving, (we expected 2 dives per day) and only got in 1 dive the whole week and that was inside the reef and only down to 20 ft!) we were terribly disappointed. They kept telling us to come and we would show up and they didn't go out - too rough. Of course they wanted us to show up so they could once again try to sell us the excursion trip to the Carribean side of the island. (which we would have booked instead if they hadn't promised here that the diving was great, exceptional, etc.) when we called the dive shop and the resort before booking.So, all in all, we enjoyed the week because it was our honeymoon, and as such, the resort was a great place to vegetate after the stress of the wedding - very romantic, great food, great sun, etc. But since we are divers, we will most likely not go back as we want both - the 4/5 star all inclusive combined with good scuba.Also note: Excursions:We took one excursion tour I highly recommend: the Jurassic Safari was EXCEPTIONAL and well worth the money. You get to see a lot in an action packed day. Very great to do!AVOID: we didn't go because we'd heard before we went, but please do not go to the Dolphin encounter - the place captures animals and dumps them into chlorinated water, and they have 3-4 animals per day die. Don't subsidize their horrible treatment of animals!

<Content>Four days of Paradise We arrived on 2/21/05 and was pleasantly surprised by the beauty of this magnificent hotel/resort. We were shown to our room promptly -- it had a splendid canopy king size bed. One small complaint -- the room smelled musty and we opened the terrace doors and windows. There was a whirlpool tub in our bathroom (very nice) The grounds are kept very clean, the service is exceptional, the help are all so friendly. I would highly recommend this little piece of heaven for anyone who is stressed and needs to decompress. Also, I almost forgot -- it's all inclusive, food, top drinks, horse back riding (loved it). Massage does cost BUT well worth it. The rest of the spa is free, clean and wonderful.

<Content>Good Bang For the Buck Overall, the Paradisus is a nice place for the money. Is it the Ritz Carlton? No. But it is much cheaper, and it is all inclusive. About this reviewer. I have been to upscale resorts such as Half Moon in Jamaica, Ritz Carlton in Naples, and Elbow Beach Bermuda. I've also been to various Club Meds and Sandals. I am a well off professional from the tri-state NY area. My opinion is mostly positive. The grounds are very pretty. The rooms were clean and attractive. The beach was fantastic. The food is decent (Although better at Sandals - which was also better than Half Moon believe it or not). No one got sick (altough we were very worried). One morning there was no milk at breakfast though. All the dinner restaurants (there are 8 I believe) were satisfactory. Service at meals was fine. Again, the service in the Carribean is never what you would get at an upscale US hotel where capitalism thrives. Issues with the place are as follows: Too many Europeans compared to Americans. Hotel workers had no mastery of English. Other than that, no complaints. Remember what you are paying before you complain. Also remember that the rating system is based on Carribean hotels, not NYC.

<Content>Blissful week - beautiful wedding at the Paradisus I've been meaning to write this review since we got back from the Paradisus in mid-October (2004). It took me a while, but here I am.My husband and I got married at the Paradisus in October. We had 70 guests attend the wedding - 66 of them stayed at the Paradisus. Everyone had a wonderful time. The grounds are beautiful. The staff is helpful and friendly. The beach is absolutely stunning. And the food was very very good. And if you are looking to have a wedding on site, their wedding Coordinators are extremely capable and sweet. Not a single thing went wrong on our wedding day - or the entire week for that matter.We visited 8 different resorts in Punta Cana before choosing the Paradisus. The only other place I considered was the Melia Caribe. The Melia is bigger and had a nice fub vibe to it but the wedding coordinator there was very rude and bored, and so we chose the Paradisus. So the week we arrived at the Paradisus was one week after all of those hurricanes hit so we were really worried about what kind of state the resort would be in. To our relief the resort was in great condition. None of the rooms were affected. They had had some flooding and some of the grounds were disturbed, but just one week later - you would have never known. We were lucky because many other resorts suffered structural damage and a couple even had to shut down for a few weeks. OUR ROOM was one of the Royal Suites right on the beach. We had a beautiful room with a king bed, a separate living room, an adjoining dining room with balcony and a great bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate shower and another balcony. You do pay extra for the service royal but it was totally worth it for us. The service was great. We had our own butler in the morning and evening, and a private concierge that helped me immensely in tracking down my guests and helping me send them notes and gifts to their rooms etc. :) The butlers worked their butts off because every night was party night in our suite - after spending all day on the beach or at the pool - with swim-up bar (the crowd favorite) we would have dinner - and then invite a few friends and family up to our suite to play cards and listen to music - so the concierge would run up extra rum and softdrinks, cigars, chairs - whatever we needed. They were happy to accommodate - and we were happy to tip - even though you don't have to!MEALS: We usually slept in and missed breakfast so I would normally just head straight out the door to the beach. On the mornings we managed to make it to breakfast we had it at the buffet and ordered omelettes. We usually had lunch at the italian restaurant - during the day it's not Italian, it's another buffet but it's really well done and they serve spanish, american and italian food. The also have a huge grill where they served burgers, hot dogs, grilled chicken and fries - that's the only thing my little brother ate and he seemed perfectly happy with it. Their seafood paella was excellent, as well at the rice and beans and fish. You won't go hungry! Dinner is a little bit more formal and a nice experience. We would get dressed every night, and then go to the French restaurant, Steakhouse or Mexican restaurant - all of them really really good (and I'm definitely a foodie). My favorite was the Mexican. It was absolutely delicious. The french restaurant had the best wine and desserts (and a great lobster dish). We had a private rehearsal dinner at La Marina (seafood) restaurant, and the hotel did a beautiful job. It was a beautiful intimate setting, candlelit, with blue and white table cloths and covered chairs. Flowers on every table along with the menu cards that they printed out - I chose the menu of a caribbean avocado salad, a choice between filet in green pepper sauce or the coconut red snapper and a coconut flan for dessert. Some people had seconds! Everyone loved it! The morning of the wedding, my sisters and mom and I spent at the spa for manicures/pedicures. And then went back to my suite where the hairdresser did our hair. I just showed her a picture of what I wanted and she gave it to me. I have very long, curly hair and it was an extremely humid day, but she straightened it and curled it again, and not one hair was out of place the entire night. At the end of the night, my hair was the only thing that still looked perfect! :) Anyway, while I was busy getting ready, my future husband was at the pool with his best man and some of the rest of our wedding party - just hanging out!The wedding was everything I ever imagined and more. The trio that we hired played the most beautiful music and followed me down the aisle. My flowers were perfect (all roses in every shade of pink and coral and ivory). And the ceremony was performed by my sister and involved a couple of readings and prayers from friends and family. It was magical. We met with the judge while everyone was at the cocktail hour and made it official (it took about 3 minutes). The photographer at the resort is one of the best I've ever seen. Our pictures are magnificent. I don't think he took one bad picture. I was really nervous about that aspect but it ended up being the best surprise of all. If you marry there - or even if you're just visiting, you MUST take pictures on the beach around 5pm. Just perfect. AND to make it even better - we left the resort 4 days later, with all of our pictures. No 8 month wait, like here in NYC!Our reception was held at La Albufera steakhouse. Again everything was gorgeous. And the food was outstanding. Even better was the service, the waiters were on top of everything. We never had an empty glass. They had cleared a great space for a dance floor and the deejay played music that I had put together along with merengue and bachata and other music from the Caribbean - and let me tell you, that dance floor was never empty! We had a 6 hour reception, nobody left early! :) Not even my grandmother who was up there dancing with all of us. After the reception, my husband and I went back to our suite and found the stairs lit with candles and rose petals, and a path of candles and rose petals that led into the bedroom and bathroom where the jacuzzi tub was surrounded with candles and had a huge bubblebath already going. Along with a bottle of champagne and a platter of fresh fruit, and leftover slices of our cake. All thanks to our wedding coordinators! It was a wonderful surprise, I was very touched. What a nice way to kick off the wedding night! :)We slept in again - spent all day on the beach and then met our guests for dinner to thank them and wish them a great trip home. (We stayed 4 extra days ALONE and it was heavenly) We've received so many notes since coming back, and have met up with many of the people that attended our wedding, all of them along with BOTH of our families agreed it was one of the best vacations anyone ever had. We will be returning to the Paradisus again for a long weekend for our anniversary. And my mother-in-law has asked that we send her there for her 70th birthday next year. :) Happy travels. (If you'd like to see pictures of the wedding - or have questions that I was unable to address here, please feel free to email me at clarissa_cana@yahoo.com and put 'Paradisus Wedding Info' in the subject line. Thanks!)

<Content>2nd time back This was a return visit for us and just as wonderful and the first. May I preface this review by stating my wife and I are golfers. We played the Cocotal course 4 times and the Punta Cana Resort course once. Both are excellent courses and pleasantly different. We made tee times via fax and it worked just fine. No problem.  Now the Paradisus. Frankly, this resort meets our needs perfectly. Food was more than adequate. Fresh and with excellent variation. Room was great too. In Bldg 32 #2321. Second floor corner. Enjoyed meeting the many nationalities. Very cosmopolitian.  Any needs, which were few, were attended to in a most effecient way. Simply put. If we go south next winter for some rr and golf the Paradisus will be right at the top of our list. By the way we booked through Apple Vacations and were again most happy with there portion of the vacation.

<Content>Had a wonderful time. We just returned from a one week stay as part of a large group (200 people). We had no major complaints about the resort. The food was very good (if a bit bland generally); of particular note was Rodizio, which was excellent. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the grounds and beach were gorgeous. Five or six people in our group experienced gastro-intestinal problems of 24-36 hours duration but everyone else, including us, was absolutely fine. Any problems that we experienced were extremely minor, e.g. not receiving face cloths every day. Overall, a wonderful  relaxing holiday at a beautiful resort.

<Content>Comparing to Melia Caribe/Tropical We stayed in the Caribe last year in Dec. and loved the place, but the beach had lots of seaweed and no waves to play in. This year we upgraded to the Paradisus hoping for the same quality of hotel with a better beach. We were absolutely satisfied with the beach. The water was clear blue/turquoise, had manageable waves for body surfing and was clean of seaweed with miles of walking available. The hotel was not up to the level of the Caribe however. Things seemed a little shabbier, but maybe our memory of last year had tainted our perception on the second visit. In general it was still a beautiful property, and we found the staff to be exceedingly friendly, but not always effective.The towel boy as mentioned in a few other reviews definitely had an attitude, and they did occasionally run out of towels. We also had to request soap and washcloths a few times. The food was not as extravagant, but certainly more than satisfactory. And the shows each night were excellent. If you are going for the beach and outdoor activities, I would recommend Paradisus. If you are going to enjoy the luxury of the grounds and ambience, I would recommend Melia Caribe.

<Content>Room for Improvement We just returned from our third visit to Paradisus Punta Cana (1st on in 2001, and 2nd one in 2002) and now 2005. Our first 2 visits were wonderful and we have recommended it to 1/2 dozen people all of which except one were satisfied with the property. Our visit this time was disappointing and will not be returning anytime soon. Problems:The biggest problem with paradisus is the staff. They are indifferent to rude. This had never been the case before. Tipping is not required and in the past we tipped for exceptional service. My thought this time was that they were looking for tips before providing basic service (such as getting a cup of coffee in the morning). There is a little trolly that takes you around the property although you can walk the property in far less time that it takes to wiat for the trolley. Again, we did not experience this on our previous visits. Although there does seem to be a lot of activities it was difficult to identify what they were. I had been fairly inactive on our previous visits and decided this time I wanted to do some things. I asked at the reception desk for a list of acitivites and they directed me to guest services. She gave me a list of some activities and their times but not locations. ie volleyball, spanish lessions but then I noticed a generic list of acitivities on another sheet. For these activities and the locations of the list that she gave me, I was told me to the call the acitivites center #6061. The activites center told me to come down which I did. I then had to ask about specific activites (which were listed on the generic list) lsuch as a paella demonstration and when. A list of acitivities and time where not available although he was referring to some document on a wall. He was also unable to tell me where some of the activites were taking place and referred me to restaurant reservations who were totally perplexed as to why I had come there. Just so happens that the original girl from the guest services desk was visiting the restaurant reseveration desk and she got involved and called the activity center who then miraculously came up with the information. Our you tired yet. Very disorganized. Why offer these things if the guests are unaware of them or unable to find where they are occurring. Back to the restaurants. When you sit down to a meal try to find one with a full table setting otherwise it will take you 20 minutes to get your table set so that you can actually then get served coffee, wine, soda or water or have an eating implement to consume your meal with. We found this particularly frustrating in the morning trying to get a simple cup of coffee. When we were there there was a large group of people taking up 240 rooms who were generally unhappy with things and I think they communicated this to the company that were sending them and about halfway through their stay management started showing up in the dining room to intervene with service but as soon as they left service returned to the usual level. One women I spoke to stated there is no service here. Not a huge deal but again a significant change was with the wine. On our previous visits you got a wine list and choose a wine . The wine selections were adequate in the past. The wine selections this time were limited to say the least. They might have 2-3 chardonays but when you requested one it seemed to never be available. I got to the point I just ordered white wine because in actuality that is all they had-one white that was some various type of wine. They did have an additional wine list that you could pay for and although I never utilized that I suspect that those wines were more readily available. The towel man was downright rude. When I made the unfortunate mistake of not returning my towels on the same day I used them, I was addressed rudely. Another guest told me that she kept her towels with her for 3 days and when she tried to exchange them in mid day she also got spoken to. After a downpour the towel man was refusing to exchange towels for dry ones. Pluses:The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are very nice. There are many activities which are included, ie: demonstrations of cocktail, vegetable carving, spanish lessons etc. They have horseback riding, a small zoo along with darts, ping pong and the list goes on and on. Entertainment at nite is a little boring and gets old but how much can you realistically except. Generally the quality of the food is good. Remember where you are and that it is an allinclusive. The housekeeping services were good and responsive to our requests. The beach is spectacular. The liquors are all top shelf and even if you don't request a specific alcohol brand they seem to use only fairly decent brand names. They even use real Baileys in their mudslides. It really is very unfortunate that the staff attitude had such a strong impact on our stay but in retrospect it did and I would consider this fact seriously before making a decision to stay at this property.

<Content>Second worst vaction so far, and I've had MANY!!! I have stayed at many resorts all of them being in Jamaica so I wanted to try out the beautiful Dominican Repulic that everyone was raving about. This hotel is a 5 Star (suposidly) but I was EXTREMELY dissappointed with many aspects.1. NO ONE SPOKE ENGLISH!!! Thank goodness we learned how to say milk and beer in spanish otherwise we would have never gotten anything. 2. I brought my 2 1/2 year old daughter because they advertise this to be a family resort yet the kids club was always closed and when it was open ( maybe once ) there was no one there that spoke English tha I would safe leaving my daughter with. There were no other children there so we opted to swim in the pool. 3. I have stayed at Sandals, Couples, Swept Away and even the Holiday Inn Sunspree resort and I would consider this a 1 star in comparison to all of those. There were no activities organized by the staff, it was an entertain yourself kind of place. I am into relaxation but fun games by the pool is what most places thrive on. 4. The resort had horseback riding and my daughter LOVES horses so we wanted to take her. Well, of course they didn't offer it on certain days and told me to go check out the adult horseback riding session. They told me that I can take my daughter on that and hold her. So then we went to make the resevations for the adult one and again I asked to make sure that I can take my daughter and hold her...they confirmed with out a doubt that I can. After the bus came, picked us up and drove us for about 1/2 hour to the horseback riding place and after waiting 10 minutes the instructor then tells me that I can't take my daughter because I'm not a professional horse back rider. I threw a fit and after all of it he agreed to have the guide take my daughter, that was the nicest part of the trip.5. Restaurants were closed often and they all seemed to open on the last night we were there. Food was ok, the best was the seafood where we had lobster on the beachfront rest. Steak in the one was undercooked and we couldn't go back to try another night because it was closed. Also, for picky kids be prepared to pay for the kids while having them eat fries for 7 days...kids menu was horrible, maybe because there was none. Overall I would not go back to this place nor would I recommend it to anyone. I have stayed at 5 star resorts and besides the scenery around the grounds, the parrot zoo I have to say I was very dissappointed with this resort.

<Content>not 5 star paradisus - Kristine  Michaelwe stayed at the paradisus for the first time this year. this was our second trip to Dr. last year we stayed at the iberostar dominicana. the only good thing about the paradisus is that they have a big food selection. otherwise in my eyes the service is not 5 star. i had five problems: the first night we had a link from window because of rain. the water was all in front of our bed. we called front desk like two or three times and it took them about an hour and half to respond. the only way the mess got cleaned up was by the maid who was passing by. so technically the front desk never sent anyone to the room. the second incident was the phone in the room did not ring so by that i did not receive important calls from parents for one whole day because of this and i did not get a new phone till following day. the third incident was the maid never left towels on of the days we were there and they did not bring them until after we phoned them like three or four times. the fourth incident was that maid did not make up the room one day until 3 PM and we had to call house keeping again like 4 times before they responded. the fifth incident was that we called on two different days for a wake up call and we never got any of them. the food was k not bad. drinks was good. we had god weather we were there for 7 days dec 29 - jan 5 2005. our room was near the beach. we went parasailing, horseback riding, rented atvs and went on a boat ride. i would go back to dr again but not to this resort

<Content>OBJECTIVE CRITICISM Having travelled extensively and possesed of reasonable expectations for a vacation destination, I offer the following remarks regarding Paradisus and some of the less candid reviews:Paridisus is not an oasis in a third world country, it is a reflection of that country for good or ill. It has beautiful beaches. Many of its people are friendly. Because costs are low, rooms can be larger. So much for the good points.The food is dangerous. Chilled food is not kept cold and insects and bird droppings mix with most every dish. Rudimentary food handling precautions are not observed. Aside from the bacteria count, the food is just plain bad. Any review to the contrary should not be believed. The water, you are told is filtered. The filters appear to have never been removed or cleaned. Only the blessed avoid serious intestinal disorders. If you must go, bring plenty of antibiotics and Immodium. And money. You will need it when you try to leave early to escape the noxious food, surly room help and chronic shortages (the towel stuff you have read about is incredibly true).Not one person in my party (22 people) liked the place.

<Content>Xmas week My family just spent the week tween Xmas  New Years at the Paradisus, a Melia hotel.We were quite pleased particularly with the affiliated golf course at Cocotal. If you do not suffer from IES (inappropriate entitlement syndrome) which unfortunately afflicts a significant minority of affluent folks, then you'll have a fine time at this resort. The food was varied and generally good and nobody in my gang appears to have contracted traveller's diarrhea. The friendliness of the staff more than compensated for the occasional lack of fresh towels and the total absence of kleenex tissue. The clientele were international with Spanish, French, German  Russian being heard as often as English.The only disturbing issue is that notable percentage of guests were not taking anti-malarial medication. Please know that there are 3 forms of malaria and the current one in Punta Cana is the most deadly. The side effects of chloroquine are usually insignificant  allow for a relatively carefree vacation. If you don't take the medication, you are behaving irresponsibly and needlessly putting your life ( your kids') at risk.

<Content>All Inclusive With Privacy Stayed 12/11 to 12/18 as an RCI timeshare owner - The Sol Melia Vacation Club is on-site to assist timeshare guests.Check in and lobby area include a small casino, Mexican restaurant (7pm to 10pm) lobby bar (with nightly music), ATM, 24 hour internet access (small fee), gift shop, evening entertainment (local dancing, singing, etc) and clay tennis courts. Small but well maintained SPA and work out facility is located half way between the lobby and the beach. Free shuttles are needed in lieu of 10-15 minute walk from the lobby to the beach. Beach - This is what you come for! Bavaro beach - a wide private beach with soft, sugar sand and warm aqua blue ocean water. Nice 3-4 foot waves that can be enjoyed by the whole family. Very relaxing with no vendors in sight and security was present, as well. Many topless women (of ALL ages) sun-bathing AND walking the beach. However, with very few Americans present, this is not much of an issue. Beach bar is open from 10am until 7pm - try the Barcelo Anejo Rum on the rocks! A hut on the beach offers reasonably priced massages with views of the ocean (e.g., 30 minutes for USD$30).Accommodations - two floor villas that are spread out nicely for optimal privacy. Gorgeous landscaping within the resort. Of the 11 Royal Service villas (USD$50 extra per person per night), only 5 are ocean front. Don't pay the extra money until you see where it is located on the map. Non-Royal villas closest to the beach are #2 (where we stayed), and #3. Royal Service rooms get Butler service (which includes a personal driver - somewhat handy) and separate lounge (with breakfast and free internet). However, I heard the food was limited and some Royal guests choose to eat at the normal breakfast buffet instead. Royal Service rooms also have a private area on the beach with waiter service. Note, the beach bar is easily accessable and you can sit in the Royal area of the beach if you wish.Food - Italian (Dolce Vita), Mexican (Antojitos) and Chinese (Pavillion) were cleary the best for food. Breakfast buffet (Hybiscus) was more than adequate. Lunch options are limited to the buffet (La Palapa) and Dolce Vita. Japanese restaurant (Sakura) is a joke. They have no sashimi or sushi - only a cut roll and it's horrible. The steak is prepared in front of you but that too tasted very bad. We left after 20 minutes and apologized to the staff that were friendly and tried their best.Shopping - Closest shopping is a 20 minute walk down the beach (to the right). You can't miss these local huts as they are located right of the beach. They are friendly and will accept ANY reasonable offer. Alternatively, Plaza Bavaro (a more formal outdoor space) is a 30 minute walk or 5 minute taxi ride from the hotel. If you want to walk it best way is on the beach and then cut through the Occidental Grand Flamenco Hotel out the front entrance. Beware of the cigar shops like cigar Center Bavaro which claim to sell Cuban cigars that are not real. Best bet is to buy cigars at the Paradisus from a vendor who sets up at the lobby bar. Overall, a great all-inclusive experience for USD$50 per day / per person.

<Content>Terrible Place!!! This was by far the worse vacation of my life I do not know who gave this hotel a 5 star rating. I wanted to go back home after just 2 days. There were never enough towels at the pool, had to wait 30-60 minutes for a towel, experienced 1 blackout where the light went out in the whole hotel, if you are planning to go there with a child forget about ever having a high chair, after many fights with the staff I just used regular chairs since they only have 4 high chairs for all 10 restaurants. My son and myself got food poisoning, this just could not get any worse. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy, beware!!!

<Content>Don't Be So Finicky! We Had A Great Time! Please note I'm writing this using the 'Caribbean Hotel Grading Scale,' which requires you to keep big city expectations in check. If you need Mariott or Hilton caliber accommodations to be happy, don't go anywhere but the $350 per night resorts, no meals or drinks included, and you'll be fine. We've stayed at several Caribbean resorts, and for the VALUE you receive at Paradisus Punta Cana, NOTHING BEATS IT!  Yes, the weather can be iffy in the shoulder season. We had plenty of sun and even when showers moved through you could still get sunburned that same day -- a little like Hawaii -- breezy, mix of sun  showers.  Given our previous experience, we expected the food to have some of that that waxy texture of microwaved frozen stuff but when it turned out to be fresh and quite good I gave it an 'A' (Caribbean Hotel Grading Scale). Sure, the steak wasn't aged USDA Prime, but F-R-E-E is a very good price, and the meals were completely rounded out with appetizers and deserts. And the drinks -- Ye Gods! -- you have to excercise serious self control or you will be in big trouble! A glass of wine, Sir? Are you sure you don't want the whole bottle? Fast service, good quality, and if you want Johnny Walker Black they've got it -- even at the pool's swim-up bar.  A very nice feature of the resort is its huge scale -- the two-story multiplex units are spread way out among palm trees, hibiscus, gorgeous shady greenery, with paved paths winding everywhere and the continuously running feature of these little golf cart trains (like a Disney parking lot shuttle only much smaller) that are always running and you just flag down. This is one resort where you don't need to worry about a view -- no one has one of the water -- everyone has the same one: the view of palm trees and gardens. The little marketplace is a 15-minute walk out the front gate, but isn't anything like other cultural shopping places you may have been. Even beach vendors in Mexico have better goods. And the initial asking price (try $120 for six refrigerator magnets -- no joke!) is so ridiculous it tells you this is where locals come to share your wealth.  Our advice: go and enjoy the all-inclusive features, and just keep the lid on expectations. We're going back again.

<Content>Hey, I was thinking it's 6 apples Resort We (two couples with 2 year olds) just got back from Paradisus...stayed there from 11/21/04-11/28/04. The check-in personnel was surprisingly helpful. The rooms were ok in size, but the mattresses and pillows are so old...not comfortable at all. There were no doors into the bathrooms, I guess it's ok when you are staying with your spouse only, but when you have a kid in the room that is not a great feature. Shower curtains were so ancient...it was impossible to use them.The first two days was raining, but then it got nice and warm. We went to the pool, but unfortunately they were out of beach towels at 10am...they told us to come back in an hour, they still didn't have the towels until afternoon. The same thing was happening every day. I was thinking that 6 apples resort would have no trouble supplying beach towels to it's customers. I guess I was wrong.The food was ok...big variety, but not the greatest quality. If you have small kids you might have a problem with food. The only things are the cereal and yogurt, but how many days your kid can eat that. If you want to get reservation to French or Japanese restaurant you must do it right away when you arrive. We tried to do it next day, there was nothing available for the whole week. At last, the day we were leaving, the bellboy service didn't pick us up at the right time, we called the service three times, but they screwed up and our bus to airport left without us. When we asked at the front desk how we are going to get to the airport, they said we have to take taxi and pay for it ourselves. Of course, we had to fight for that since it was totally their fault. Finally, they agreed and gave us a ride to the airport for free. At last, we were tired and aggravated. I wouldn't go there again.

<Content>Bad Weather but calm place w/ Beautiful beach  My best friend and I were at The Paradisus from Nov. 18th through 22th. My first bit of advice is don't go here around this time if u want a good tan cuz u probably wont get one!We left newark airport at 7 am to connect in miami to get to DR and finally arrive at our hotel and by the time we checked in it was at 6pm. Talk about the longest day. There was so much waiting it was so frustrating. So now, we're grumpy.The rooms were nice. We had two queen beds and a little sitting area plus a decent size balcony. We had some issues with the shower. The water kept changing temperatures, cold one minute, scalding another. Girls, this water is terrible for your hair too.The first nite we decided to check out the show. It was entertaining. The staff is really friendly, almost too much that some may hound u alot. Or maybe we just felt that way b/c we were two single girls and most of the resort was made up of couples or families. So I guess we were prime meat!RESTAURANTSWell, probably the best meal we had was the pizza from La Dolce Vita. I'm italian so i defintiely had better which just goes to show u the food was, eh. We were so looking forward to eating tostones and maduros (fried bananas) and the spanish food like rice and beans etc. Well, when we finally got to, it was ok. Funny thing is I think i had better spanish food here at home. We also ordered room service one night b/c we were too late for dinner (forgot about the hour AHEAD here in DR) and we felt sick the next day which ruined our plans too do any kind of activities. Japanese was not very good. I love sushi and this to me was NOT sushi and the food had no taste. The buffets were ok.ENTERTAINMENTWe only went to a couple of shows. They were fine. Then afterwards the dancers and staff make it sort of interactive by dragging u to the club or attempting to dance merengue with you in front of the bar. Which is fine if u have rhythmn and can at least follow them. The club (pub) for us was not the best. They play alot of disco and bar music (we were looking for alot more dance, hip hop or spanish music). We attempted to go to the outside club (local) called AR-AY-EEH-TOE (i think thats how us say it) That was cool, mixed locals and tourists from the resorts. Music there was really good. They say u shouldnt leave the resort. Well we're two girls in their late 20's and we walked this club at 11pm. And let me tell u, we were defintiely a little worried but they guard nearby said he would watch us as we walked to it. (It turned out to be 50 feet from the hotel, but he smiled and watched us anyway) Have to say, the people are very friendly. Thanks to my friend knowing spanish, I was lucky.ACTIVITIESWe did't get to do any activities, but they had plenty if u wanted to. We did manage to do the salsa merengue and bachata dancing lessons on the beach, that was the highlight of our vacation. We got to show our new moves off with the staff dancers at the pub on our last nite and drank til we got tired. The drinks were ok. A little watered down I think but not that bad. The staff was nice. They always tracked us down to get us to do things. WEATHERThis was probably the worst of the vacation. If the weather was at least sunny, we definitely would have had a better time. The only thing we really wanted to do was get some sun, enjoy the beach and do some water sports. The first day (wich was our only really nice sunny day) was shot b/c we decide to go to bavaro plaza to shop. That was cool though. 10 minute walk from the hotel, and def shop around first, u can bargain pretty well. But don't be too frugal, these people are pretty poor so u dont want to take TOTAL advantage. Also, there are lots of bugs and u get bit. BRING DEET AND MEDICATIONS from home cuz they charge an arm and a leg for this stuff. We actually paid $25 for the bug spray (and that we even talked him down too) Its cheaper in the hotel gift shop we found later ($18) The rest of our vacation was so cloudy and windy. We had to wear our towels as blankets on the beach. We figured we'd get sun through the clouds.....yeah right. Well, I at least managed to get a little rosey in the face. Guess I can be grateful I won't peel. Overall, my advice is if you're looking to relax Punta Cana is cool. But if u wanna party, go to cancun!

<Content>Loved the Paradisius Ohla! I was at the Paradisius from 11/8 - 11/15/2004 and all I can say is that we had a Great Time!!! We are going back this March 2005! The food was much better then we expected, the place was absolutely beautiful and the staff was outstanding, especially the bartender's! The weather wasn't that great when we were there, but we didn't care, we made the best of it! A special Kudos to Ramon, Johnny Walker, Hector, and Ricky! If you go, tell them that Patricia said Ohla, and I love you baby! I highly recommend this resort and I'm looking forward to going back in March!

<Content>Paradisus Was Paradise We were at The Paradisus for the week of Nov. 5th through 12th and here are some of my observations.DEPARTUREWe got to the airport (Toronto) 3 hours before our plane left. We were able to get great Exit Row seating which was very comfortable for the trip down.ARRIVAL IN PUNTA CANAWe got though Punta Cana immigration with no problems. Time from landing to leaving the airport was about 15 minutes. My husband and I were travelling with my brother and sister-in-law and we decided instead of waiting on a tour bus for everyone to get their luggage we'd grab a cab to The Paradisus. It cost us $22 U.S. split 4 ways we thought that was pretty cheap. Plus we arrived before everyone else and had no line up at the Check In counter.CHECK INI had e-mailed the hotel a few times asking questions about hurricane damage and developed a chatty-type relationship with the a very nice reservations fellow. In one of my last e-mails I asked him if I could bring anything down for him or his family. He graciously declined. Anyway once we got there we found out we had been upgraded (who knows if it was because of our correspondence) to Royal Service rooms. The only drawback was that they were not ready and it took approximately from 1:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. to get into our rooms. They were even more beautiful then the pictures on the web site. Huge balconies too. The wait was definitely worth it! They were really well situated, close to the ocean and the pool.RESTAURANTSBecause it was low season only 7 of the 10 restaurants were open every night. This really wasn't much of a problem but we didn't get to try the Mexican because the last night we planned on going there it was closed. We loved the Japanese (went there twice), liked the Italian, loved the Seafood, liked the Brazilian, loved the French, liked the Steakhouse and enjoyed the Hibiscus buffet for breakfast and lunch every day. We also ordered room service at least once a day, either for toast and tea early in the morning or for a couple of bottles of wine and cheese and crackers late afternoon. On the whole I thought the food was great.ENTERTAINMENTWe only went to a couple of shows. They were very good but I find that once you've been to one of these resorts the entertainment starts looking the same. We did visit the Casino every night and managed to leave a few dollars there each time. It was still fun though.ACTIVITIESThe pool was amazing. There were lots of things to do. Archery, ping pong, darts, all types of lessons. There were loads of palapas by the pool and the ocean so we managed to stay out of the sun but still feel warm and tropical. The ocean was amazing, blue/green water and nice waves, perfect for wave jumping. Later on in the day it got a little rough but we usually swam early. My husband and brother went snorkeling and they loved it. They took them by boat to a calmer spot about a 10 minute boat ride away. We didn't take advantace of the scuba diving or the horseback riding but some people didBARSGreat drinks, great bartenders.DEPARTUREWe were due to be picked up at 9:00 a.m. at the Hotel by the tour bus. We told them we would get to the Airport by ourselves and about 8:50 we took a cab to the Airport. We all got Exit Row seats again and had absolutely no line up at the check in counter. About 15 minutes later the Airport was packed and we were all done.All in all it was a terrific vacation. The only negative was the weather. It was beautiful for the first 3 days, hot and sunny. The next 4 days were a mixture of rain and sun. We never had a totally bad day but we did swim in the rain and it would have been nicer if the sun had been shining.We brought lots of a href=

<Content>Great vacation My husband and I along with our two sons (ages 8 and 12) returned form our vacation at the Paradisus on Sunday November 14. There was a pretty long wait on the bus to the hotel and the ride was pretty rough. We arrived to the hotel around 7:30pm and decided to upgrade to the royal suite which proved to be a great idea. There are many perks with the upgrade ( VIP breakfast in the lounge, Internet access, private beach and personal butler). Our butler got us into the Marino upon arrival with no reservation. The food there was pretty good. Everyone seemed eager to please. We left tips at every restaurant we went to. We also ordered room service later that night and the food was also good. The only thing I didn鈥檛 like about the room was the tiny ants that showed up the next day. I also saw them all over the basket of croissants at the VIP lounge for breakfast. I think they鈥檙e attracted by food or anything wet (towels, clothing). But, I decided not to let them ruin my vacation. The next day we ate lunch at Dolce Vita. The food there was also good. Later that day we went on an on an excursion with the 4 by 4鈥檚 which was great. It lasted about 4 hours. We stopped at a few shops and also at a spring which was in a cave underground. We were given 10 minutes to swim so we got some great pictures. I would advise against shopping at the stops on the excursion. Both shops were very expensive and the second wanted $200 for a picture when we got one three times as big just outside the hotel for $60. (Our butler told us we could have gotten it for $30.) There are lots of kids that beg for money at the stops on the excursions. I wish we would have brought some candy or small toys for them. A few of the kids had plastic bottles with a string tied around them for toys. We ate at La Albufera for dinner, the food here was also good. The third night we ate at the Japanese restaurant and I think this one was my least favorite. I frequently eat Japanese food and the food was no where near what I鈥檓 used too. We went to the casino later that night which was ok; it鈥檚 just a little small. The grounds were beautiful, the pool was gorgeous and there were plenty of chairs and shade around the pool and on the beach. We always had plenty of towels. We also went to the spa and everyone got massages. This was nice. I would recommend spending money for a cab ride back to the airport since we had to stop at all of the hotels on the way back. In all I had a great time. Though upon returning home I did have stomach pains and diarrhea for a few days and have been very nauseous. I did forget the first night and brush my teeth witht the tap water out of habit, so I'm betting this is what it was from. But, everything else was great. Just dont drink the water.

<Content>5 out of 6 sick after returning home As my wife and I returned home from our trip 11/6-11/8, we discussed what a great time we had and how we would go back in a minute. Unfortunately, by midnight that nite, I started getting diaria and I'm now going on my 4th day. When I called the other 2 couples who were on the trip, all of them were going thru the same thing within 12 hours of returning. Wish I could narrow down what the exact cause was but we can't. We ate a variety of foods and frequented almost all resuraunts. The sad part is the resort was fantastic, the staff was great and prior to returning I would have given the food an A. Also, none of the resturaunts allow shorts at nite so make sure you bring long pants.

<Content>maggots in our food What is a vacation if you become sick? Read as many reviews as possible and for those who have vacationed here who thought so highly of this resort, remember the buffet tables? The food sits out all day. The restaraunts open at 7:00am so the food should be fresh and some foods chilled unless of course it sits out overnight? We always arrived at 6:45am to eat as the golf bus left at 7:05am. I didn't clue in until I found maggots in my prunes one morning and after this Fear Factor incident, I recalled that the fruit was never chilled. The management placed the blame on the quality controls in the U.S. during import. BOLLOCKS! The gestation of a maggot is as early as 8 hours in a warm environment. All I can say is if you have booked and paid...good luck.

Unfortunate for us we had 4 days of hurricane when we arrived which made us sure our wedding wouldn t be going ahead, but it did and it was fantastic. Food is amazing and lots to choose from my fave restaurants were the italian and french... will definately go back as soon as we ve saved enough maybe for 10th annniversary ha ha

<Content>October Trip Review Let me preface by saying that we have limited experience with A/I resorts, but have traveled extensively in the Caribbean. We originally were put into room 2015 which had no hot water for two days and A/C that quit on the second night. After moving to room 2307 our experience was much nicer. The location of both rooms was excellent with an ocean view from the balconies. The room size was great and the ammenities more than exepcted. The beach at the Paradisus is fantastic. Two days out of eight the waves were large enough to make swimming difficult, but boogie boarding ideal. The other days the waves were more like 1'-2' and the swimming was great. The pool areas are absolutely gorgeous and so large as to never seem crowded. Plenty of shade for those who wanted it, and numerous lounges available.The restaurants were open on a rotating basis since it was their off season, but we managed to get to all the ones we wanted to try over the seven nights. We liked the Japanese, Brazilian, Italian and Steak House the best. The Seafood and French restaurants didn't appeal to us as much. The Seafod selections were OK at best and the French had few of the classic French dishes you might expect. In fact we cancelled our second reservation for the French to be able to try the Brazilian. Of course this isn't to say that they would not appeal to others, just not to us.I did really enjoy the extensive wine selections and enjoyed a different bottle of wine with each dinner. The service is first class and we encountered few language problems that our limited Spanish and their English couldn't overcome.My biggest disappointment was with the Royal Service which was much less than I had expected. This could be because at any given time they only have one Butler on duty to take care of 80 Royal Service level suites. Some of the services that should have been in R/S are exchanging of beach towels in your room each night which was done only one night. Making restaurant reservations which was done, but had to be redone on some occasions to get the correct times. Free interent access that we used often. A seperate breakfast area that is air conditioned and has individual service versus the open air buffet breakfast (which was also good). The butler will set up the in room jacuzzi with bubbles, flower petals and some champagne for a romantic evening when requested. The R/S suites have the better locations and most have at least a partial ocean view from the balcony.The only thing that really ticked me off was when I found out the no hot water problem in the first room was known about since the entire 8 suites in the building had the same problem due to the boiler being damaged in the hurricane. The point being that there were other rooms available that everyone could have been put into without having to encounter the problem and complain to get a different room. Additonally, they should not have been saying the problem would be taken care of when they knew that that wasn't going to occur.We also toured their sister hotel the Melia Caribe Tropical which is more geared to accept families because of all the children activities they offer. This resort was also fantastic. It is almost split in two with the childrens programs offered in one half and more adult items in the other. The restaurants and beach are common to both. Each side has it's own pool area. While families aren't restricted to one area, it appears that by situating the childrens programs all on one side it is encouraged. If we return to the Dominican Republic we would likely try the Melia Caribe Tropical next time. The resort appears to be as nice as the Paradisus and actually the rooms looked to be in better condition. So far the Royal Service is not offered there, but there are plans to possibly start it in 2005.We spoke with several other couples who were not really pleased with the Royal Service at Paradisus Punta Cana. They had the Royal Service at other Paradisus resorts and found it to be far superior. Over all we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Paradsus is awesome!!!! Great all inclusive resort. The entire staff goes way out of the way to please you. Tipping always helps (highly advise). Our room was always cleaned, the waiters knew us by the 2nd day. You never run out of things to do. The water sports are awesome diving is free at the resort, but locations are limited, if you want to dive the nicer reefs you have to pay extra. The rooms are spacious and the grounds are well maintained. Going back in December.

<Content>Paradise At The Paradisus We just returned from a week at the Paradisus Resport (Oct 8 - 15th/04) and it was wonderful. We were quite worried about going to Punta Cana after the hurricane, but were assured by Apple Vacations that the resort was fine. The grounds had some damage (trees down etc.) The staff were always working on this and it was only in a few areas of the resort. This resort did not even close after the hurricane and it seems that alot of the other resorts in the area are still closed from the damage. The resort is breathtaking from the lobby all the way to the beach. The lobby is a little hike from the rest of the resort, but you just hop on a small shuttle and they will drive you to your rooms, pool area, restaurants  beach. The only restaurants in the lobby area are the Japanese and the Mexican. All of the restaurants we ate at were very good. We especially enjoyed the French and Japanese which both require reservations. Because of the low occupancy last week, they did not open all of the restaurants each evening. They would open 4 or 5 each night which still gave you a great selection to choose from. The buffet at breakfast was great with lots of variety to choose from. They also have a buffet, grill restaurant and an Italian restaurant on the beach open at lunch. You can also get a burger, hot dog, fries or sandwich at the pool bar during the day. Drinks were plentyful and they do have premium liquors if you ask for them. You can order wine by the bottle in any of the restaurants and get bottled Presidente beer anywhere. The pool was amazing (the size of a small lake) and very nice and warm. The beach was the best part of the trip. It was nice, clean white sand with no rocks or shells to hurt your feet. The waves were not too big to handle and my kids (7  10) were boogie boarding in them everyday. We also did a couple of snorkeling excursions at the resort. They take you in a boat out to the reef and you see an amazing amount of fish out there. It is included in your trip. They also have sailboats, paddleboats, scuba diving, and horseback riding on the beach. We did all of these activities. Just remember to bring about $100.00 in one dollar bills for tipping. A dollar or two goes along way with the Dominican people. They make so little money and it was always much appreciated when you gave them a tip. Our room was very nicely decorated and clean. It was big enough with two double beds and a small seperate sitting area with couches and table and also a table  chairs out on the balcony to sit. They do have mosquitos at night and I would recommend bringing bug spray. We did go to see a couple of the nightly shows which were quite good. They start at 10:15 and go till about 11:30 and then they have dancing in the lobby bar afterward. We didn't try the casino or disco so I can't comment on either. I would definately recomment this excellent resort and will be booking again next year. Happy Travelling

<Content>Our best vacation yet!!!!! The Paradisus is a true paradise!! We were scared when we read several bad reviews of this resort AFTER we had already booked our trip! However we did not have one complaint about our trip! We were there from 9/1-9/9 and the service, food, accomodations and atmosphere were excellent! The food at all restaurants we visited were excellent! However, be prepared to wait a bit for your food to come out, the food is worth the wait though. Not a lot of English speaking staff but you could DEFINITELY get by! The rooms that have been remodled are outstanding! Plenty of activities go on everyday, there is tons to do just make sure you visit the activities desk! Don't believe the bad reviews that you read, we have been to Cancun and on cruises and this place tops all of them! We can't wait to go back! It is the carribean so it WILL be hot and humid, anyone who complains about that shouldn't be traveling to Punta Cana. Best food is at the French restaurant and Seafood Grill El Marino! The pool is awesome, the beach is even better! The dancing and music is great every night! The resort is HUGE so if you don't like to walk you can wait and catch the shuttles but you will have to wait. My husband and I will DEFINITELY go back. Just make sure you ask for a remodled room and you will have a great time!

<Content>awesome We just returned from Paradisus in Punta Cana and had to write this review to tell you how awesome it was! The grounds are beautiful, the food was quite good, the rooms were big and clean and the staff were happy and friendly!! There were 9 or 10 restaurants so we had a lot of choice for each meal. men did need to wear pants at night to the restaurants so just make sure you pack properly. Only 2 of the restaurants required reservations in advance which we booked the first day we got there. The activites staff were so upbeat and it was contagious and they seemed to work non-stop from sun up to sun down! The beach and pool were beautiful as well. Unfortunately, we did get hit pretty hard by the hurricane and lost the last 3 days of our vacation but we felt well taken care of, especaily after speaking to other vacationers at the airport on Saturday. There were many horror stories about other Resorts. The entire staff seemed to come together to get through the crisis caused by the storm. If you are planning a vacation there this week check with your travel agent to ensure that things are getting back to normal.Enjoy your vacation there - If it was anything like our vacation, you'll love it!

<Content>Loved It!!!!!! My husband, myself and 6 friends just got back from the Paradisus. We spent Sept. 4-11th there. I read all the reviews before going and did not find any of the negative ones to be true. I have traveled to the carribean many times to 5 star hotels but never an all inclusive. It was great. The food was fine. The Dominican people couldn't be any better with service and hospitality. We did upgrade to the Royal Service, you get a few extra amendities. The beach is the best I have ever been to and I've been to alot. The grounds are very well maintained and beautiful. I think that the other reviews that were bad are from people that don't know what to expect in the Tropics. It was great and I would definately return.

<Content>This hotel is Paradise!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I vacationed at Paradisus from September 1 through 7. I was a bit concerned after reading some of the horrible reviews, but after staying there, I'm just baffled by them! We travel frequently, and this vacation was one of the best we have taken! The hotel was fabulous, the beach was heaven on earth, the service was just top-notch. And a few-dollar tip goes a long way. When we arrived, we had a problem opening our in-room safe. Within minutes, a security guard was there to help us. 10 minutes after that, the reception desk called to make sure everything was fixed properly. And people are complaining about the service there?!?!?! As with most of the Caribbean, the country is very poor. If you plan to leave the resort, make your excursion plans through the hotel. Reps are all around to help you, and there are several different excursions available. The drive from the airport to the resort area is quite upsetting. Hopefully, this makes you realize how lucky you are in your day-to-day life, not to mention that you are traveling to a beautiful foreign country to vacation. Remember -- you are on vacation!! Lighten up!

<Content>awesome This is the best hotel I've ever been to!My wife and I have been travelling quite extensively over the last year to mostly 5* hotels to (sub)tropical destinations. Paradisus was simply the best hotel we've ever been to, and by far! The all inclusive formula is just awesome:- the food is excellent (says a Belgian!)- you never have the feeling that they are trying to limit your food or beverage consumption which is not the case in many other all-in resorts- the number of included activities is just incredible: Golf, windsurfing, scuba-initiation lessons including 30 feet deep dive,...I find it hard to understand some of the bad reviews in this section. There are always some basic rules you have to take in account when travelling to a tropical country1. it's hot and humid2. there are more insects here than at home3. yes it will rain, even in the dry season4. don't use water from the tub to brush teeth, not even in the best hotelsI'd advise these people to spent their holidays in Switzerland or Canada instead. Some mind the fact that hotel staff doesn't speak English. All key personel does speak English. The gardener and the housekeeping lady don't. If you have an issue, just contact the front desk. By the way, in how many hotels 5* in the US do you think that they can speak French let alone Dutch? None I've been to.DannBelgium

<Content>Best vacation ever! My husband  I visited Paradisus in June, 2004  stayed for a week. It was the best vacation ever! We have been to other all-inclusives in Punta Cana (Secrets), the Bahamas (Breezes), Jamaica (Sandals)  Mexico (Paradisus). Nothing compares to our stay at Paradisus in Punta Cana. The food was excellent (except for the Brazilian). Our suite was beautiful. The resort itself is breathtaking  well-maintained. The Royal Service staff were wonderful  went out of their way to provide stellar service. I would go back in a minute. The jitneys that transport you around the property are a good idea. We had a great time on the snorkelling trip provided by the hotel. Bring bread to feed the fish. The beach was clean, calm  beautiful. The beach bar was fun  the grilled sandwiches were the best. The outdoor grill that served hamburgers for lunch, also had excellent fried chicken - unlike any I've ever had. The pool was beautiful, large  very warm. Never a problem getting a drink at the swim-up bar. The nightly shows were ok. Not as professional as the shows at Paradisus in Mexico, or Secrets in Punta Cana. We even enjoyed the Casino. Lots of fun! The Eco-Tour was enjoyable, as was the Spa. Again, I would go back in a minute!

<Content>Never Again When we arrived, with no luggage, because American Airlines lost it, we were welcomed by a broken air conditioner, no towels, no maid service, bad food, BUGS, when our luggage arrived, no one to bring it to us, no one to accomadate us at all. I have never been so happy to come home.

<Content>Better then we expected!!!!! We read all the reviews and saw the pamplet and I must say that it did not do the resort justice. First impressions were worth a thousand plus words. IMPRESSIVE by all means. We where planning on going to Secrets but missed out on the reservation, so we went to Paradisus. It was great. From the room with the jacuzzi tub and the sunken living room to the King Size bed. The open air dinning was a little humid but this is the tropic. Service was great, remember to tip. We brought $100.00 in sigles and brought home about $50.00. It really goes a long way. For anyone who wants to know TIPS Stand for TO INSURE PROPER SERVICE. One thing to say about the day trips in the safari jeeps is that it says $84.00 a person to drive your own jeep, but when we arrived they wanted to put 4 people in one jeep. We finally got it worked out and got our own jeep. As far as the jeep safari goes, bring lots of candy and lolly pops for the kids that will over run your jeep. All they want is money and food. We thought that it was better to give them food instead of money. It really make you think how good we have it here in America. Make dinner reservations as soon as you get there. Also if you like to scuba dive do the same as they fill up real fast. Remember it is all free. The pool is warm but remember you are in the tropics. As far as shopping goes, try to shop on the beach as they where not so pushy as the ones just out side the hotel property. Now be prepared to bargin for what ever you want. We shopped for about one hour and wanted to get something to eat and found out that we had to bargin for that also. 4 beers and 2 plates of chicken and rice was going to be $35.00, good thing we asked first how much. As far as the water and ice. You will be fine. We took pepto before every meal and by the end of the trip we stopped taking it. The ice is bagged, purified ice and the water all comes from bottles big and small. The tap water is another story, use bottle water to brush your teeth. I can't express enough about tipping. We our both in the restaurant industry and they do remember. It is only a dollar. If you eat 3 times a day and tip 3 times a day you would only spend $21.00 a person for the whole week for 2 people, which is the price of some meals here in the states. Rememeber that you are in a third world counrty and the roads are not like here in America. Go and have a great time and remember that you are on vacation, and not at home or at work.

<Content>Keep your expectations low We were the guests of the resort from 8/13/04 to 8/19/04. My wife and I take a vacation at a different location every year, mostly in 4-5 star resorts. I can tell you one thing for sure from my experience that Paradisus Punta Cana is not a 5 star resort.I am dissapointed with the Sol Melia Group which is proud of its many resorts allover the world for not maintaining English speaking personnel and better food service. Although we had fun trying to communicate in Spanish using the fun dictionary given at the check in, when there is an emergency it was hard to communicate with the staff. Food is plenty and exotic. However, I was suprised to see that they kept the food in room temperature where it should be stored in refrigerated areas. Since food stays out for several hours, it is not hard to believe that it will go bad in the heat of the day, well, nights are are not any different ..hot and humid. My wife got sick and ate only bread and drank bottled water for three days. By the way, sickness from the food or dissappointment is the common subject among all visitors that we met at the airport, excursions or shuttles from all of the other resorts in Punta Cana area.One personal item, the resorts' only pizza place, Dolce Vita, which we hoped would serve safe food was horrible. This is a request directly for the resort management, somebody please show the chef how to make pizza. A margarita pizza with thin crust should not be drowning in cheese. I give them the benefit of the doubt ordering the same pizza twice, and dissappointed twice.On the other hand, resort is very pretty with its open setting from the lobby to its restaurants with well manicured landscaping. The Beach is spectacular. We really enjoyed the nightly shows and the dancers who are very friendly and fun people.Overall, If you speak Spanish, have a strong stomach and handle the heat and humid, go to Paradisus, Punta Cana. Keep your expectations low then you might enjoy your vacation.

<Content>Paradisus - Wonderful the Second Time Around Four of us, all women, stayed at the Paradisus for 8 days and it was wonderful. Two of us had travelled their last year and had such a good time we took 2 more friends with us.  I read all of the reviews and I notice a touch of attitude in all of the negative reviews. There is an air of superiority in most of the negative reviews. Yes it is true that most of the workers do not speak English but most try. Remember we are visiting their country. I do not find them rude at all. A little niceness goes a long way. But we as individuals have a habit of catching that attitude when things don't go exactly as we expect. You must understand that these folks work upwards of 12-16 hrs a day for much, much less than what we get for minimum wage and they try their hardest to please. Yes there probably is some room for improvement at the resort (not too much that I can think of)....top shelf liquor, multiple restaurants to dine, a beautiful beach, a large pool although the water temp is warm (this can't be helped because of the strong sun), a staff at the beach that makes every attempt to ensure that vacationers are entertained, nightly shows, beautiful landscaping, a spa....I could go on and on. Bottom line here is that you need to leave your superior attitudes at home and go with an open mind and enjoy yourself....you are on vacation. If you want to go somewhere where your language is spoken, then travel within your country (and I bet there will be times that you are not totally pleased, it can happen anywhere). How do you expect the staff to be kind to you if you are rude to them? Case in point as I stated earlier there were 4 of us. We had 2 rooms. When we arrived at 11:30 our rooms were ready, but they had King beds...we needed 2 doubles in each room. We were told that it could be done but the rooms would not be ready until 4:00...we had a choice take the Kings or wait. We waited, we ate, drank, took a walk around the grounds. We had a change of clothing in our carry on luggage so we were very comfortable while we waited for our rooms. The point I am trying to make is that, yes we could have been upset for the delay in the preparation of our rooms, but that would have set the whole tone of the trip....Basically, we had a don't worry, be happy attitude and that attitude took us through a wonderful week. As far as the food is concerned, use basic common sense. Just because it is an all inclusive that does not mean eat things that you normally would not, if you are not sure. Drink the bottled water, and by the way the water they serve in your glasses at meals is also bottled. If you decide to go, tell the beach crew, Johnnie, Pasqual, Wilson and Ambi that the Jersey girls said Hola. If you visit the bars (lobby and Hybiscus), tell Enrique, Omar, Santos, and Socrates the Jersey girls said Hola! (They make great drinks, even non-alcoholic drinks for the non-drinkers). Jesus at the towel shack is also very pleasant and funny (yes there was one time late in the afternoon when towels were not available, cuz folks do not return them...but Jesus makes sure that fresh ones arrive)...tell him we said Hola! If any of you are tennis players tell Raul, the Jersey girls said Hola!By the way, I don't speak Spanish or understand it, but I had no problem communicating. I am learning a little bit at a time because I plan on returning to the Paradisus for many more years to come.Go with an open mind, leave your worries behind and I guarantee you that it will be good, relaxing times. And if you are really unsure of the food, take the Pepto...didn't need it, but it can't hurt.

<Content>Best resort ever! We have stayed at 4 and 5 star all-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean and Mexico including Iberostar and Allegro resorts in Mexico, the Holiday Inn in Aruba and Allegro in Turks  Caicos. We have travelled every year for the past 15 years to a Southern destination, and Paradisus in Punta Cana is the first resort we loved so much we are going for the third time this year! The grounds of the resort are gorgeous and well maintained. Very lush with rivers and small ponds throughout. The rooms are large (even the basic Junior Suite is a good size room) and beautifully decorated. The food selection is great. A large number of a la carte restaurants so we didn't have buffet once for dinner! The Mexican, French and Italian (great pizzas) restaurants were very good. The drinks are great, premium liquor is included! We are beach people (though the pool is fantastic and very large), and this beach cannot be beaten! Large and clean with plenty of chaises. The water is wonderful for swimming. Overall, it is the best resort we have visited and look forward to another wonderful vacation!

<Content>隆隆隆 Paradise !!! I have returned from Paradisus the past day 25 of July. This was my third stay there and my opinion cannot be better (of course, but not stay so many times). I think that the place is charming and the staff really great. Although, far better service during the first week (before the 15 of July) that passed this date, when the hotel was totally full.Food is excellent (contrary to which some other users think), it exists a great variety of restaurants, thing very to be thankful when fifteen days stay there. So the wine letter is very good, with Spanish, Chileans, Argentineans, French wines, and until catalan cava and champagne.None of the three times I had stomach problems, neither myself, nor other member of my family.The personnel who takes the diving club is wonderfull, very friendly and servicial. It is of the few hotels that include this activity, although say that they only include two immersions, the certain thing is that you can do more without surcharge.It is certain that he begins to need a remodeling, mainly in the bathrooms, but he consists to me that already they have begun to do it. We will have patience.I hope to return next year. I am like in my own house (or better).

<Content>Wonderful Trip - Please Read My wife and I stayed at Paradisus Punta Cana from July 27 to August 4, 2004. We had a wonderful time. I have read all of the reviews on this site, and some of the negative reviews have valid points. I was prepared for this and didn鈥檛 let little things spoil my good time. First, I will tell you about some of the great things on the vacation, then I will respond to all of the criticisms that I read.The best part for me was the golf. Cocotal Golf Club is a very nice, but long course. There are three nines, but only two were open. It was easy to get a tee time. We took food and water from the resort to the course. My wife and I played five times during the week. The water sports were great. We had no problems getting reservations for scuba and catamarans. The other boats were available without reservations. It was my first scuba experience, and it was incredible. We got a DVD of our dive (extra), and it is wonderful. The room service was very fast and efficient. We ordered wine and champagne several times, and the longest it took was 30 minutes. The workers at the resort were very friendly and helpful. Most spoke little English, but we were prepared for this, so it was no problem. The room was beautiful, and well decorated. I was prepared for the small refrigerator and small ants which were no problem. The grounds were beautiful. Overall, if you want to go to one of the finest resorts in the world and you won鈥檛 have fun without great food and top notch service, don鈥檛 go to Paradisus. If you can relax and enjoy yourself without everything being absolutely perfect, go and you will have a great time. Also please follow the advice of the CDC to avoid stomach problems. Use pepto-bismol four times a day. It works. If you have a special condition, and need extra protection, go to your doctor in advance and get a prescription for Cipro, and take it as prescribed, starting a day before you go. My wife did this due recent intestinal surgery, and it worked for her.Here is my response to criticisms of Paradisus:Persistent seller of timesharing/excursions 鈥?Tell them politely you are not interested and they will lay off.Sometimes long wait for trolley to main lobby from beach/pool area 鈥?It is a nice ten minute walk. I did it several times a day and enjoyed it greatly. It isn鈥檛 any longer than the walk from the car to the mall store you are going to.unavaibality (sic) of the good restaurants 鈥?I鈥檓 not sure what this person means. I think that they mean that the restaurants that take reservations are hard to get into. This is true. You can book in advance, but these restaurants only have nicer d茅cor, not better food. If you are going to this resort just for enjoyment of the gourmet food, don鈥檛 go. If is adequate, not great.Towel problems every day 鈥?We were unable to get towels at the beach a few days late in the afternoon.take 10 minutes to get a drink 鈥?The service was slow for drinks in a few of the restaurants, especially Hybiscus.Unavaibility (sic) of catamarans 鈥?We made a reservation two days in advance. There seemed to always be a lot of no shows, so if you were willing to go for one hour (reservations were for two hours), there was no problem.often forget to replace shower towels 鈥?There was a sign in the room that you had to leave them on the floor if you wanted them replaced.Most of the staff do not speak English 鈥?This is true. It was quite charming. I only speak a little Spanish, and I had no problem. We also played golf with a Frenchman who spoke no Spanish or English. After two holes we realized that we both spoke a little German. Sehr gut.The (restaurant) service is very weak 鈥?I never expect good restaurant service at an all-inclusive resort. There are too many people to feed, and you tend to get ok service. We had a great time at the average restaurants because we found what we liked and focused on it. Excellent wine. We also asked the manager of the Mexican restaurant to make a special dish for us (asked a day in advance). He was happy to comply.the rooms were not ready 鈥?True. Our room was not ready. It was no big deal. We went to the bar and then took a tour of the resort. Had a great time until 6:00 when it was ready. Be prepared for this and don鈥檛 let it ruin your vacation.there are at least two power outages per day 鈥?There must have been some problem when this person was there. We never had any outages the week we were there. The electric clocks did run 1-2 minutes fast per day however. If you are an electrical engineer, you will know that this is due to inaccurate frequency which is not corrected.they require long pants for men in a lot of the restaraunts 鈥?I鈥檓 glad. All of these restaurants are air conditioned.Bad smell every day behind the pool bar 鈥?I noticed this. I think it is trash storage. I avoided the area after the first few passes.Had to avoid eating any raw foods (fruits, salads etc) and ice cubes due to possible bacteria 鈥?This is true. Go to the CDC web site and check out traveler information. At any location in DR, you should not eat any raw food. You should also take Pepto Bismol four times a day. I followed this routine, and had no problem. I did use the ice cubes and had no problem.Ants in the rooms especially in the bathroom 鈥?I didn鈥檛 see them at first because they were so small. We had them in the bathroom, and in the living area one day. Once or twice I flicked them, but they were so small that I didn鈥檛 even bother to call about them. Then were totally harmless.Two of our friends had their birth certificates stolen 鈥?There is a safe, and we used it. If you don鈥檛 you are taking your own chances.a two star hotel 鈥?Wow! While it is not a 5 star by USA standards, but it is very nice. The room was quite large, with a separate living area. It was very nicely decorated. The marble in the bathroom was nice. The wood frame around the door was in excellent shape except for one small area about one square inch which was gray where water had sprayed from the shower. Overall the rooms are like a nice Hilton, much better than Holiday Inn. The food and restaurant service is probably three stars 鈥?not the reason to go there, but find something you like enjoy.The drinks, well, not a lot of options, and even if you are willing to pay $45-75 for a bottle of wine 鈥?This person must only like California or French wines, which were scarce. I personally have a wine cellar with about 500 bottles in it, and I know good wine from bad. They did not have a good selection of Chardonnay, but in all other areas, the wine was excellent. They also had wines that were not on the list, but were included. I had no need to pay for any of the premium wines. The Japanese Restaurant had the only good Chardonnay 鈥?all of the others used the standard resort wine list.There is a lack of chair (sic) and the customers reserve their chair from the middle of the night 鈥?Maybe this person was there at a different time of the year, but we had no problem finding chairs at the pool or on the beach.only a few restaurants are inside and air conditioned (barely) 鈥?French, Japanese, Brazilian, Italian and Mexican are air conditioned. Seafood on the beach had a nice breeze and didn鈥檛 need it. Hybiscus buffet was sometimes hot for lunch.one of the passengers had passed out from heat in the open air airport 鈥?The airport has two terminals 鈥?one is air conditioned. They are close enough that it is no big deal to wait in the air conditioned one until close to your boarding time. When we were there, there was a nice breeze. Walkways for guests were also used constantly for employee vehicles 鈥?True. I didn鈥檛 consider this a problem. The 24 hour room service took between 5 and 25 minutes because they did this. It was great.many people go topless 鈥?True, true, true.El Romantico...no biggy..nicely decorated but same food 鈥?True. Same with the Japanese restaurant.The Hibiscus and Grill buffets are open concept and attrack (sic) flies 鈥?Not true for Hybiscus 鈥?the buffet is enclosed in an air conditioned room with sliding doors. I never saw a fly on any of the buffets. The grill buffet is not air conditioned, but it is close to the beach and gets a good breeze. They have cooling units under the salad and fruit (but as I mentioned above, the CDC recommends not eating them.)the pool, at times, was littered with straws and plastic cups 鈥?True, too many slobs as guests. It would be nice if they cleaned better around the pool bar.Our transfer from the airport was a stifling hot bus with no air conditioning or windows that could be opened 鈥?The transfer is arranged by your tour operator, not the hotel. They usually stop at multiple hotels making for a long hot trip. I recommend spending the extra $22 for a taxi. heavy odor of what smelled like raw sewerage (sic) on the grounds 鈥?I smelled this one time, but only for a second.I had a lobster tail so overcooked it was like mashed potatoes 鈥?I had this also. I have made the same mistake myself. Spiny lobster is easy to overcook.I hope you like cats because we had 3 STRAY CATS IN OUR ROOM 鈥?I only saw stray cats a few times, never in a room. I think this was a fluke.

<Content>Hell on Earth I wish i would've read these reviews before I booked this vacation. I agree with every single bad review on this site. I arrived in Santo Domingo on July 7th. I made a reservation at Paradisus for July 17th. I had my husband fly into Punta Cana on that day and I drove 4 hours to meet him.Originally I booked one room for my husband, myself and my 7 year old son. But after I thought about it i figured that i should bring my sister so that she could babysit so my husband and I could have alone time. Well we thought we were headed to paradise until we went to check in. We arrived at 2pm, we were told that Check in was at 3pm. Well we didnt get our room til 7pm. I also requested another room which they didn't have because they were booked until the next day. We payed for 2 rooms on Saturday and received our second room on Sunday at 6pm. When we finally got our room the ceiling fan was making a lot of noise, the bootleg minibar didn't work,our AC was leaking and there was no toilet paper holder. We ordered room service since we got our room so late. the food never got to us. The restuarants are horrible. The food gave us diarrhea and made us nauseus.You could tell them to please make your food well done and sure enough they would give it back to you raw. Then all the restuarants are outside so you get dressed up and sweat throughout your dinner. And during the day the flies are all over you. They don't have most of the water sports that they say they have. They tell you to go down the beach to the next hotel to do things. The horse back riding is full even before you make your reservations. The most fun we had was outside of the hotel. We went on a helicopter ride, we drove speed boats and got on 4 wheelers. The staff at those establishments were very friendly. Unlike all of the staff in Paradisus. Especially the people at the front desk. Even the general manager didn't help us. He made believe that he was going to do something but everything remained the same. Lets not for get their mini club for our 7 year old. My son walked home by himself and the staff failed to notice this. When I arrived to pick him up the club house it was closed. Noone could tell me where my son was. Lucky my son knew his way back to the room.This was in no way Paradise and i will never go to an all inclusive. This is a * star hotel. The service is horrible. Its better to go to a 5 star hotel and come out of your pocket. I do not recommend this place.

<Content>Paradisus lives up to it's name We have just returned from a two week holidy at Paradisus and regret not having booked for longer.This is our sixth trip to the Dominican and this hotel is definately the best we have stayed in by a long long way.The room (sorry suite) was superb, clean, roomy and nice and cool with lots of space. The maid service was good but as they don't speak English we had great fun using sign language and always got there in the end. So what if it takes a bit longer - who's in a rush in paradise !All the resturants were excellent, more so considering we were in a third world country. On the last night it was my wife's birthday and the meal they laid on in el Romantico was superb. In England it would have cost us 拢120 at our local 4* hotel restuarnt and here it was all free - from the champagne to the courvoisier VSOP brandy with lobster starter, large chateaubriand main course, flambee pancakes and a birthday cake thrown in.The staff were wonderful and Jackie left with half a dozen red roses.They have just about any drink you want albeit you have to speak clearly to the barstaff even though their English is better than my Spanish.I must say here that for the first week there was only one other English couple but we enjoyed talking to the colonialists from North America. There was always someone nice to talk to especially when they heard our English accents.The only downside to the whole resort was that the beach shelters did get reserved quickly and early despite the signs saying not to before 10am. However being English, if the towel owners weren't there and it was before 10am the towels got placed on the flloor and the wind got the blame.We didn't have any problems with upset stomachs but we did keep to the bottled water for drinking and brushing our teeth.We also enjoyed the free spa facilities and it was like having your own swimming pool as no-one else seemed to want to use it.Although there were trolley buses we tended to walk as it was the only exercise we got and the buses ran on Caribbean time.If you want to buy anything the best bet is a stroll down the beach to the shops and remember to haggle and don't pay more than 25-33% of their original price. I loved it when they got all aggrieved at my first offer but it is a set up so you don't push so hard at the next shop.All the staff were lovely and tried very hard to please (albeit usually at caribbean pace again) but considering it was very hot to have to work they all did very well.To sum up if you just want to relax and live life at the caribbean pace, drink too much, eat too much and just enjoy yourself you cannot pick a better place that Paradisus - they can't do enough for you.

<Content>Excellent Vacation for the Family We stayed at Melia Paradisus from July 10th - July 17th. I came with my wife and two girls, ages 8 and 5. However, we had a family reunion there which included family from Spain and Florida! When you ad it up, we were a group of 27 people! First of all, the service was fantastic even when faced with 27 people eating dinner at the same time. The key is to make RESERVATIONS! and no worries maan, be patient! This is the island lifestyle...easy does it maan! Where are you going the next day? Work?? Our favorite restaurant was the Japanese. If you come with kids, this will be a treat for them since they cook right in front of you, much like Bennihanas for those in the US. We also enjoyed the Mexican and the seafood one. No one got sick. There were no power outages. The weather was fantastic. The kids enjoyed the nightly shows which were very well produced and dancing merengue until 1 AM. The highlight for me was scuba diving for the first time. I STRONGLY recommend it for those who can. We saw some beutiful marine life...including a medium sized shark! There were plenty of bath towels and soap. We tipped $5 to the maid for water bottles and got a huge case that lasted the whole week! For those who want to get drunk everyday, make sure to tip so they ad some more alchohol in your drinks. The people who work there were really great and personable, of course we speak fluent spanish so we were able to strike up great conversations. But they want to learn English too. Some negatives are: the pool water was way too warm for my taste, slow room service, the batting machine doesn't work when it rains and of course leaving. Thats it! Go, Go, Go! It really is a beutifully designed resort. Makes you feel like staying and living there. Where else can you get caviar at a bar?

<Content>Not Five Star We visited the Paradisus from July 9th until July 23rd the summer of 2004.The grounds are very beautiful, but the service is horrible. Most of the staff do not speak English.The restaurants have decent food but the service is very weak. The beach is beautiful, but the hotel always runs out of towels.The rooms are decent, but the maid service is very bad. Rooms are barely cleaned on time. Pillow cases are missing and they often forget to replace shower towels.I must say that the Paradisus is the farthest thing from a five star hotel. The horrible service just ruins everything about the resort.

<Content>Don't Worry--You will LOVE it! My husband and I just returned from the Paradisus on July 18th after a week stay and it was wonderful! Like many others, I read the reviews and worked myself into a panic for no good reason. I honestly think some people wrote a review for the wrong hotel! The room was beautiful and cleaner then some chain hotels I have stayed in here in the US. The food was better than what I expected (especiall after reading some of the reviews). The buffets were excellent for breakfast and lunch and had a variety of selections. They do try to cater to all the different types of people who visit the resort. The a la carte restaurants were wonderful and we had a delicious meal everynight! Neither of us got sick, in case you were wondering.The beach and pool were equally beautiful but I preferred the beach because of the cool breeze and refreshing ocean. The pool area does not get the seabreeze and I found the pool temp. to be rather warm and not refreshing at all. The hotel offers many water activities that are included in the price of your stay.The service was also excellent. We tipped $3 to our servers and they took care of us. Please remember, you are in a foreign country that is also a third-world country and these people depend on the tips for part of their salary. The country is extremely poor and the large resorts depend on their own generators for electricity. The power did go out on our last night a couple of times but there was a wedding going on and I think the generators can only handle so much! It was a minor, MINOR, inconvenience. The Caribbean is not the United States and if you keep that in mind you will have a truly magical time!

<Content>an awesome time This vacation was definitely amazing. I went with my best friend, family and family friends. The grounds are beautiful and the service is great. The food on the other hand is not anything to brag about. That did not have a negative effect on the trip at all. The Japanese Resturant (Hokkaido) was the best food we ate the entire trip. Make reservations the night before because it fills up quickly. The rooms were nice, spacy with marble floors and showers. Look out for the tiny ants that come out at night and the occasional cockroaches. I did not have any encounters with the ants but my parents were not so lucky. The bartenders were okay but cannot understand English very well, it wasn't a major problem though. The beach was perfect. I recommend parasailing so you can see through the water and a lot of the resorts. It was beautiful. When you wake up, before breakfast you should get a hut on the beach before they are all taken. When you go shopping (which is a 5 minute walk on the beach) do not ever pay the asking price. Haggle them down to a price you want to pay and show them the money to assure them that you have it. Once they see the money it is hard for them to say no to your price. Bring suntan lotion and other sundries because it is very expensive at the hotel gift shop. The cheapest sunscreen was 24.00 US. Avoid the tap water, the hotel provides bottled water at the bar. I suggest brushing your teeth with it so you don't get sick. If you are 18 or older the fun pub was something fun to do every night. Even if you aren't 18 the people don't really care, all you need to do is turn your age bracelet the other way and they will let you in. Dress cool for the plane ride there because the airport is very hot! I enjoyed staying at the Melia Caribe Tropical, it was so much fun!

<Content>Well worth it overall I visited Paradisus from June 4-7, 2004 to attend my best friend's wedding. I loved this place. I almost cried when I had to go home. The grounds are immaculate and are constantly being groomed throughout the day. The beach is gorgeous -- a few topless Europeans, but what else is new? The food was generally good. I couldn't get enough of the 24 hour room service -- I took advantage of that bigtime. Our room was FANTASTIC -- we stayed in a junior suite with a jacuzzi and a private balcony. I strongly recommend that you request a junior suite. The other guests that stayed in standard rooms were unimpressed. There were ants in our suite... tiny ants. Blame it on the climate and location and not the cleanliness. The maids were fantastic. Only one complaint about them -- they start cleaning the rooms early in the morning and they talk a little too loudly for my taste, but its not a major deal. Not to me, at least. The trolleys that pick you up and take you around the resort are a little slow. If you miss one, you may have to wait 10-15 minutes which isn't a big deal in paradise. The staff was extremely nice, helpful and courteous. My advice, get a junior suite room, stay away from the italian restaurant (HORRIBLE), and enjoy yourself. The buffets and other restaurants are great. Oh and one more thing... if you take a cab for $5 U.S. dollars, you can go to a nearby mall area. You can walk it if you don't mind the heat, but we cabbed it. Be warned: The vendors are extremely pushy. If you're a sensitive person who easily gets upset, avoid it. But if you grew up in NYC, you know how to deal with people, ignore them and not let them get to you. We got two great paintings from this mall. Yes, there was drama with the sales people arguing over who should get the credit, but hey, I don't blame them. When someone gives you a price, act like you don't want it. 9 times out of 10 they will lower the price. If you're looking for a booming nightlife, you won't find it at Paradisus. The casino sucks and the nightclub has few patrons. From what I understand there are local clubs at other resorts, one by the name of MANGU that's suppose to be pretty good. FINAL THOUGHTS: This is a FABULOUS RESORT. I highly recommend it. I had a wonderful time, overall. I would go again, undoubtedly. Take my advice and you'll have a great time. PS. Only drink bottled water. No biggie. I do this already in the U.S. And stay away from seafood or anything exotic. Its better to be safe than sorry.... I do this in the US as well. Enjoy yourself. Don't let other reviewers ruin what could potentially be a great vacation.

<Content>In Aww If you want info... read me!!First off, it was absolutly beautiful. Just the landscaping alone was breath taking. The golf course was amazing, not to hard either (if your a beginner like me!) It was $33 USD for the cart and the green fee is included with the hotel. The boat excursion to the typical market was fun. There is alot of selection so dont get stuck at one vendor!! The beach was as blue as the sky, and the pool was huge and clean. Not too many kids either, if that helps. The massages go from 30USD to 120USD, beware of their very strong hands!! (LOL) The restaurants are plenty, and they are pretty relaxed on dress code. It is a must to eat at the Hybiscus for breakfeast, there's alot to choose from. Tips go a long way as they are constantly serving your every need. Room service was alright, but the food always got there cold. It's such a big resort that they even drive you around in what they call a mini bus. The room was nice, and the finishing touches were great. The selection of booze was surprising, when they say premium they mean it! (Grand Marnier). I would definatley go back. Don't pay any attention to those who wrote bad reviews, unless your a spoiled whinny brat who is never satisfied!!

<Content>Should not be rated a 5 STAR! I just got back from this resort a few days ago. It is a complete disappointment. However, the grounds  scenery are absolutely amazing. You really are in heavy when you arrive at their lobby. Once you take a step towards the check-in area, that's were the nightmare begins. When we arrived, the rooms were not ready. We had barely enough time to get ready for the wedding we had to attend later that day. My boyfriend had to expedite the check-in process...amazingly it worked! The room they assigned us was picture perfect. It was a Caribbean style junior suite right next to the pool and the beach. I was within steps away from all the major restaurants and attractions. Once we got settled in we began noticing a few details that were minor at the time. No toilet paper, no fresh towels etc. You must know there are at least two power outages per day. Once before dinner and the other during. You are limited in what you can do when the power is out. There isn't even running water. When we dined at the restaurants it was like pulling teeth out of a child to get some soft drinks served. When you try and ask for a manager, no one seems to know the organizational flow. Another hassle was the lack of towels being offered. They would run out of towels everyday, and you must keep them with you at all times. I, as well as one of our friends got locked out of our rooms for quite some time. We had to physically walk to the lobby and demand a new key that was functional. Make sure you take everything you will need....the boutique is a rip off. They were selling regular Wal-Mart beach bags for $64 USD not pesos, a chap stick cost me almost $5 USD. There is no micro-management there, if you have a problem with one of the employees you are better off working around that problem then seeking to resolve it. The most amusing part of the whole trip was how fast we managed to check out and leave for the airport without any problems whatsoever! JUST DON'T EXPECT A 5 STAR TREATMENT!

<Content>Cheese Pizza in Paradise We, my husband, my 11 yr. old son and myself, just returned from the Paradisus on July 17, 2004. I must say we had a wonderful time. The resort is gorgeous, with amazing landscaping. The rooms are spacious and very nice. TIP #1: When you check into the resort, they have you leave your luggage at the front of the lobby. Be sure that after you check in, you go back and claim your luggage and have them take your luggage to the room with you. We waited for 1 1/2 hours for our luggage to come to the room and my husband ended up having to go back to the lobby to get it. We had a room with two double beds. The room has tile floors anda nice caribbean decour. The bathroom was all tile with a jaccuzi tub. We had a small refrig. that was stocked with all kinds of soft drinks and bottled water. If you want beer in the room, you have to call room service. We had room service many times for lunch, and the pizza is very good. Tip#2: We took along $50 in ones and tipped the maid $2 per day, along with small gifts we'd brought for her (lipsticks, matchbox cars, Barbie dolls, baseballs). We also tipped the room service guy $3, and we tipped at dinner $3; we got excellent service.The beach is absolutely beautiful, and we never had trouble getting a chair. The beach is right across from the Hybiscus Restaurant where breakfast is served. TIP#3: Wear your swimsuit and coverup to breakfast so you don't have to go back to the room. Most rooms are a nice walk from the beach and you spend most of your time walking to and from your room if you don't plan ahead.TIP # 4 My husband is a physician and we started taking Pepto-Bismol two days before we left for vacation. We took two capsuls four times a day for the whole time we were there and we (my son and I) only got sick from the food once. We all three ate at the buffet for breakfast (avoiding all lettuce, fresh fruits, shell fish, etc. and opting for only hot items and bottled drinks) We ate dinner at the mexican rest. twice- very good and no problems. We ate at the french restaurant with no problems. But, we ate sweet and sour chicken at the chinese restaurant and my son and I both were vomiting by 2 am. My husband, who has an iron stomach, had a little diarrhea the next day, but I guess we got ours up so we were fine by morning. We talked to a couple people who were ill from the food that had to see the Dr. at the resort, and they were given Cipro (antibiotic) that helped them...but it was very expensive. Take the Pepto...prevention is worth a pound of cure~!TIP#5 We went on the Monster Truck Tour- BE SURE TO WEAR YOUR SEATBELT! (not included...$80 per adult, and $45 per child) and it was very much worth the money. You get to see the real Punta Cana. They take you to tour a typical home, to visit a sugar cane plantation, a Hatain Voodoo Doctor, a natural river which is gorgeous. Be sure to take along a couple bags of candy or suckers for the children. When they hear the monster trucks coming, they all run to the road screaming for candy and money, and they're so poor it will break your heart to not have something to throw to them.We also went on the Santa Domingo Tour ($60 per adult and half for children) and it was excellent, too. We got to see Christopher Columbus's tomb, a beautiful chruch, D. Columbus's home (son of Christopher). We had lunch in a restaurant- food very good. Save your money to shop here, best prices by far! Be sure to bargin, and be sure to try the Mamajuana, no, not marajuana...MAMAjuana, it's very tasty.Overall, it was a very good vacation. The people are very friendly and do speak fairly good english, but it helps if you do speak a little spanish. Learn a few phrases and you'll be fine.

<Content>Got Married at Paradisus Paradisus, Punta Cana is absolutely fantastic.My wife and I were married there in February 2004. We were there for a week and our wedding guests comprised about 1/3 of the resort during the weekend of the wedding (60 guests). The staff was fantastic to us and our guests. There is something for everyone. My 72-year-old dad enjoyed walking the spectacular grounds and seeing the sites, and the children in the group enjoyed splashing in the surf and playing on the beach. Our wedding coordinator, Maria, took care of every detail of our wedding, which came of beautifully. Our wedding planning took about 1 hour of time on Thursday morning and everything was perfectly executed at 6pm on Saturday. If you are planning a wedding/reception/honeymoon, figure to spend about $7,000 for the whole thing including 1 week lodging transportation to the island and the carribean dresses  linen outfits that we bought for the wedding party. Not bad at all compared to the cost of a domestic US wedding and reception!!! This low-cost even accounts for the fact that February is peak caribbean travel season! Food (including reception food) and top-shelf drinks are part of the all-inclusive. The reception dinner was held at the El Marino restaurant because that was the only place large enough to serve 60 dinners at the same time. The food was impeccable...better than any regular meal on the island (the others were good, just not AS good). Travel agents and Paradisus' wedding coordinator are critical to getting your guests to the island with minimal pain. If you speak minimal spanish it is helpful to have a native spanish speaker as part of your group to translate some of the english words that the staff is not used to hearing (e.g., vegetarian meal, horse-drawn carriage, microphone). One of our spanish-speaking buddies came in very handy for that. If the wedding coordinator is with you at the moment, she'll handle all that. Weddings can be held either on the beach or at the Wedding Garden. The Wedding Garden is pretty, comes with a horse and carriage and is a better choice for an evening wedding given that you'll have no privacy or space on the beach after 9am. There is something called Royal Service (Servicio Real) offered by Paradisus which the travel companies like Apple Vacations do not set up for you. If you are getting married, definitely upgrade to SR, which if I recall is only $75/week/person. It gets you a bigger room with a private lounge, unlimited towels and internet and most importantly a Concierge who can get you a tee-time on any course and a reservation at any restaurant with no problems. I had her book a morning tee time for 16 people without issue. Another tip -- given that Customs can be dicey, bring the wedding dress and everything you'll be giving as part of any gift bags into the country in carry-on. The USA3000 people give you extra-special treatment when they see the dress.Importantly (to us, anyway) the majority of our wedding guests were 25-35 year old hard-partying types and there was plenty for them to get into. Paradisus fun pub is the equivalent of a US mid-sized bar with a decent-sized dance floor and DJ, is open until 4am, and their liquor is included. The transports run all night, so no designated driver is necessary! Those not quite hung-over got up every morning and headed to the huge pool with the swim-up bar, and managed to run them out of fresh coconuts (used to hold Coco-Loco's) everyday before Noon. We couldn't begin to afford doing an open-bar wedding domestically for these people :-)It was the perfect low-stress, affordable, something-for-everybody wedding and is sure to be our Anniversary destination every-other-year.Google our names to see our wedding website, complete with pictures!-M  C Harden.

<Content>Nice Vacation My wife  I  2 other couples just returned from the Paradisus yesterday. I was excited about the trip and had been reading the reviews on this website for a few months now. Some people seem the saying conflicting things about the resort, so I read it mostly to get some tips. We all agreed that the resort was beautiful. The pool was beautiful, the water was warm, but when it's 90 degrees outside, that's what happens. The beach was also beautiful. At no time did we have a problem finding chairs,  there were six of us. If you go down early, we went about 8:30, you have your choice of chairs at the pool  the beach. I feel that if I'm awayon vacation I don't want to sleep all morning anyway, I can stay home and do that and save a lot of money. If you go to the pool or beach later, there's still pleanty of chairs. The staff was great. Not one person had an attitude, and every staff member we met went out of the way for us. We did leave $2 for the maid every day  we got extra towels  great service. The rooms were beautiful, and spotless. We saw them cleaning one day and they do a great job of cleaning. In fact everything at the resort was spotless. They do a great job. They room has a hair dryer, Iron, Ironing board, microwave, refrigerator with water  sodas, soap, bath gel, shampoo, conditioner, etc. The restaraunts varied. We ate at the Steak House, Japanese, El Romantico, Barzillian, Buffet. We usually had breakfast at theHibiscus buffet. They had scrambleds eggs,bacon, omeletts, fried eggs, hard boiled, pancakes, french toast  lots of other stuff. After a big breakfast we usually had a snack for lunch, but there was pleanty to choose from.  Now my complaint: In all the reviews I read I didn't see much about the thing that bothered us the most. Lack of Air Conditioning. Only a few of the restaraunts are air conditioned. In a country where it's about 90 degrees with high humidity, I would think air conditioning would be a priority in the eating areas. None of us enjoyed our dinner in the steak house, not because of the food, but because it's hard to eat when sweat is dripping down your face. After that we only ate in air conditioned restaraunts with one exception, the seafood rest., because it was on the beach  we got the breeze. One couple we were with ate at the chineese rest. but sat outside. The lobby is beautiful, but also not air conditioned. The shows are in a theatre in the lobby, which is also not air conditioned. We went to the show one night  were so uncomfortable we had to leave halfway through. We wanted to see the disco show one night, but we were sitting there sweating  went back to our rooms instad. My other objection, and this might just be me, is that they require long pants for men in a lot of the restaraunts. When I'm on a relaxing, laid back vacation  it's very hot I'd like to be comfortable. I had several pairs of Docker shorts, which I thought should have been acceptable. After all this IS a beach resort. When their not providing A/C in the restaraunt, they should go out of their way to make you comfortable. Of course this is NOT the United States, so we couldn't make an issue of the fact that they allow women to wear shorts, but that's another issue. Would I go back? No. But that's only because there's so many places that I haven't been, I would rather go someplace new. If I was going back to Punta Cana, I would stay at Paradisus again. The last thing-Of the six of us, no one got sick,  we ate almost everything. We drank bottled water, which they give you pleanty of, but we all had drinks with ice, salads, fruits, etc, and go for the massage at the spa. I went for the first time  had to go back again. Tip nicely, they makew very little money If you're considering the Paradisus, don't let the negitive reviews scare you away. Enjoy.

<Content>Dominican Republic not the best vacation spot We arrived in Punta Cana on 6/27/04 and were pleasantly surprised at the beauty of the resort and the quick check in. The reception clerk offered us an upgrade to royal service for $45 pp/night which we thankfully declined since other royal service guests later in the trip said it was not worth the money. We departed on 7/4/04 with diarrehea from the food or water (not sure) that started on 6/30 Overall Opinion: The Paradisus is definitely the best resort in Punta Cana with the exception of Secrets Excellence (Adults Only) but is not worth $300/night for 2 adults. I think there are much better places to stay in the Carribean for the money and you do not have to worry about getting sick from the water, food and possible hurricanes. (St.John, St Thomas, Aruba, Bermuda etc.)Summary of our trip:Pros:Extremely friendly, warm and accomodating staffBeautiful clean white sand beach with crystal clear blue waterBeautiful tropical pool with lots of shaded areasLush tropical rainforest surroundingsGreat French (El Romantico), Chinese, Seafood (beach restaurant) and Mexican (Antoijes) Restaurants with excellent service from wait staffPretty good selection of unlimited bottles of wine and champagne at lunch and dinner24 hour room service (food, soda, wine or beer)Mini fridge stocked with bottles of soda in roomGorgeous marble public bathrooms in main lobby areaAny issues we had we promptly attended toOffered lots of water sports incl in package (scube, snorkling, kayaking, sailing) Top label liquor when requestedNight entertainers were professional dancers and put on a nice show (props were def amateurish)Plenty of beach and pool chairs with shadeCons:First Room on ground floor had water on walls and strong mildew smellSecond room on the top floor had mild mildew smell and broken flushometer on toiletBad italian food and pizza at La Dolce VitaMost of the staff did not speak english at all or very little (except the reception and head waiters)Bad smell every day behind the pool barTacky room decor and beddingBad smell inside room safeWe got diarrahea on 6/30 and mild nausea that we are still getting over (a lot of other people in the resort had the same problem) We did not eat anything except bread and coke for the last few days of the tripLack of air conitioned theater (nights are humid and it is uncomfortable to stay outdoorsNot all of the restaurants are air conditionedSometimes long wait for trolley to main lobby from beach/pool areaWater in the pool was hot like very warm bath waterFrozen Drinks are made from cheap mixes that do not taste goodCasino is a jokeHad to avoid eating any raw foods (fruits, salads etc) and ice cubes due to possible bacteriaAnts in the rooms especially in the bathroomA lot of ants on the floor near the pool that sometimes were on the lounge chairsAvoid Horseback riding- horses were not well trained (One went into the ocean and lifted up its feet in the air almost throwing a young girl off)

<Content>Not bad -- Stayed at the Paradisus in Punta Cana from 5/29 - 6/14/04 --- thought it was a very nice resort. Too long to be there but we were able to go to most of the restaurants twice. Romantico was the favorite by far -- lobster tail was wonderful. Language barrier is a little tough. Loved the all inclusive. I drink wine and actually very good wines were included. Was even able to get a French one at the front bar that was great! Try their drink - 7up and dark rum -- very good also. My son could go anytime and get drinks and food by himself. Great amenity. Pool is beautiful. Beach is just ok but we spent a lot of time there. Lots of included activities and my husband was able to do 8 dives -- included if you are certified. It is not the States but is not as good as Cozumel or Cancun. Was interesting to try something different. If you want to take an island tour, the best was the OUTBACK SAFARI -- we had a blast! Our guide Sammy was great! I did have a difficult time with the food so use lime on all vegetables -- helps alot.

<Content>Did not expect to be so sick We changed our flights to leave two days prior to our scheduled departure. My husband and I love the benefits of all inclusives but by the third day, I was only eating dry toast and cheese and crackers.We took advantage of the Royal Service in this resort and the staff were great-they helped with every request that we had. You can certainly tell the resort is getting used to such a high volume of tourism though-we received mail in our room for a different room and one night, at 11 pm someone knocked on the door to give us an extra room key that we never lost or requested??? None of this was major, just something that we noticed. There are a ton of chairs everywhere and the grounds, pool and beach were amazing, I just wished that we could have used them more. After every meal, both my husband and I were sick and in the bathroom. I got so paranoid that I restricted everything that I ate. It all came to a head when my husband, who was fine and in the pool with me, came in the room for the day to get ready for dinner. Out of literally no-where, he began to shake, shiver and had a fever. Within 20 minutes , he was violently vomitting. After that, he began to start to feel better. By the next morning, we knew we had to leave. We vacation once a year, and this was no way for us to enjoy ourselves. We are not adventurous, we like to relax, lounge and eat. We spoke to the hotel, who mentioned that they cook in coconut oil and that some people do not take to it well. Although, they did offer to cook special meals for us, this was no way for us to spend our all-inclusive vacation.We spoke with a lot of other guests who, for the most part had mild discomfort for their trips. We spoke with antoher individual that was rushed to the local hospital for the same symtoms as my husband. We read all of the reviews here and do not listen to anyone complaining about the rooms, beach or pool.So, we came home two days early anyway..... Everyone has a vacation, sooner or later, that is not up to par. We are not overly picky and can overlook most things but a cheese and cracker meal for dinner every night was so disappointing.We can not tell you to go or not to go, because there were plenty of people having a blast, we just weren't.When you go to the Paradisus, take an open mind and if the food agrees with you-you WILL have a great time because the resort is just beatiful. I just hope that people do not react to the food the way that we did.

<Content>Not what Americans are used to We went with a group of 4 other couples. I have to start off by saying the resort itself is BEAUTIFUL...now if only the food and staff were on par. Of the 10 of us, 8 got sick from the food (we all travel all the time and know what not to eat). When we would go to the restaurants, they never seemed to want to accomodate our group EVEN though we always had reservations for ten. We were even told Not Possible but we had the reservation card in our hands. Two of our friends had their birth certificates stolen, fortunatly they were retired military so they were able to use their military ids. Any time we had to deal with the staff of the hotel (besides our room maid) it was always an argument. We even made sure we gave extra tips even though this was an all-inclusive resort. We didn't like being UGLY americans but that was how we were treated from the very beginning. If you are looking for night life at this resort then look elsewhere. Everything goes quiet by 11:00 except for the casino which might have 10 people in it. All in all, we will be looking for a new resort that lives up to its five star rating.

<Content>FAntastic Vacation Sorry to be so late with this trip report about the Paradisus Punta Cana, in the Dominican Republic. We had an excellent time there last month. Before we left we had read all the reviews on the internet, both good and bad. We never found anything to complain about in 8 days. We can鈥檛 even imagine how those who complained had such a different experience. I think it is possible that some people actually were talking about a different resort. We had a friend who, when we told her we were going, said that she had been there several years earlier. She told us all about the resort, except, it turns out, she was talking about a different resort in Punta Cana, not the Paradisus. She didn鈥檛 even realize it. Maybe that鈥檚 what causes the complaints; people see Punta Cana and write their complaints without realizing they are in the wrong resort discussion.Upon arrival, we were given a full explanation about the resort, given our shell armbands, room assignment, safe keys, etc. We were also served a frozen drink before we left the counter. A very nice touch. There was no waiting and no delays in getting to our room.The resort was beautiful, clean, and spacious. The grounds were beautiful with lush tropical greenery that was neatly trimmed and constantly being cared for by workers. Our room was spacious and immaculate with beautiful furniture and the maid service was excellent. The pool is beautiful.The food in all 8 restaurants was very good and the service was wonderful. We had breakfast in the buffet restaurant every day and the staff quickly got to know us, where we liked to sit, and remembered that we wanted champaign with the meal. We usually tipped several of them a dollar or two every day because of their attentiveness. I believe that these small tips were really appreciated. The liquor was top shelf and freely given. In spite of this, we only saw one person who was drunk. He was part of a large family of 16 who were there and he tried to fight with another member of the family while in the pool. The rest of the family took care of him. Other than this there was no indication of over drinking on anyone鈥檚 part.All resort personnel from bartenders, servers, cleaning staff, those involved with gardening, and many of those who were renovating several buildings on the grounds were very friendly. Almost every person smiled and said 鈥淥la鈥?whenever we passed them, day or night. The bartenders often would dance to the music which was always playing in the background and were always smiling and attentive. The beach was beautiful and chairs were abundant. We spent a lot of time there and there were many shady spots if you wanted to get out of the sun. The topless ladies were also appreciated, maybe just 9 or 10 of them at any one time.The entertainers who put on a different show every night were excellent. They really seemed to enjoy what they were doing and their many costumes were beautiful. Their dancing skills were very good and well choreographed. After the performances they would stay around at the dancing area at the nearby bar and dance among the guests who were having a great time. There were a few merengue 鈥渓ine鈥?dances that they did each night that were a lot of fun and many guests joined them. We even bought a CD of these songs so we could reminisce at home.I was originally reluctant to go to this type of resort because I am a BIG fan of cruising but I am a convert. This resort had everything a cruise has but more, and better. Better food, better drinks, and friendlier staff. The guest were mostly from Europe and S. America and the Americans probably amounted to about 20%. So expect a lot of smoking, especially since the resort provides free cigarettes at all the bars. Since everything was outdoors basically, this was not a problemWe are looking forward to going again next year. Asta la vista.Don S.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel My girlfriend and I spent a week at the Paradisus in May of 2004. We loved this hotel and had a wonderful time. Prior to going, we had read many reviews of this hotel on line, most of which were very good. This hotel exceeded our expectations. None of the issues that were the subjects of the few negative reviews we read on line materialized for us. The hotel grounds are spectacular and very well maintained. The lush, tropical setting is breathtaking, especially at night. You can walk anywhere on the hotel grounds in 5-10 minutes. Our 2nd floor room in one of the 32 bungalows was fantastic - very clean, spacious and conveniently located by and between the lobby, pool, beach and restaurants. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was 85 degress every day, only two days of clouds and some rain. The language barrier was never an issue. The pool was one of the best and largest we've seen in the caribbean. The beach was perfect and well maintained. We never waited to get into any of the 10 restaurants (we ate around 8:30 every night). We especially enjoyed the food at the El Romantico (French) and Sakura (Japanese) Restuarants, which are the only two restaurants you need reservations for. The drinks were all top shelf liquor and never watered down. The lobby is incredible - it's all open, with many different ponds, fountains, foliage, nooks, fish, turtles and sitting areas. The hotel offers many different daily activities. We went snorkling, played beach vollyball, did aerobics and went in a boat to se the wreck of a tanker, which is beached offshore about 2 miles from the hotel. This was a flawless vacation and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering going to Punta Cana. We would definately go back to the Paradisus again.

<Content>Your $$$ goes a long way here Just got back from this resort...I rated 4 out of 5. i am a pool person but the beach was so amazing i went there every day ..there is plenty of cover on the beach for those not wanting to soak in all of the rays, there are no covers on the chairs but there are plenty of thatched huts on the property - we were even able to find them at 11am... food - i am not much of a buffet person to begin with so i only ate at the buffets for breakfast ..lunch i stuck to dolce vita (the italian restaurant) b/c this is the only non-buffet option. for dinner i highly recomment the japanese restaurant and the french restaurant (el romantico)...they call in french but i think it is more of an american steakhouse/seafood place.. the other restaurants are ok but these two are by far the best. we had no trouble making reservations , although we did make them the day before. staff was kind and friendly , no problems with service of the language.. we became friendly with one of the servers @ dolce vita (Janderson) and he actually worked at the French restaurant at night and set up a lovely table for us ..I think we were one of a handful of americans there .. wich was fine be me . plenty of toplessness on the beach so don't be surpirised ..for the cost i would go back again - you simply can't beat it - and the staff went out of their way to please you ...meet up with Janderson @ dolce vita and he will go out of his way to make your dinner enjoyable ...don't wait until the last night to go to El Romantico ....

<Content>Great Trip My wife and I returned from 5 nights on 8 June. Out of five trips to all inclusive resorts, this was the best overall. For those who have had bad experiences in the past, our room was like new. We had good experience with room service, maid service, and waiter service. Plenty of towels, bath mats, and washcloths plus two robes. We had no bad experience with food, all was very good to delicious. The buffet in Hybiscus is in a room seperate from the outside environment. You can see the buffet through the automatic sliding doors. They had more variety than we could sample. Different every day. Language was no problem. I speak some Spanish but many times would find I was speaking Spanish and they were speaking English for practice. We had many bottles of water with no ill effects, also we saw them bringing in big loads of ice from an ice factory, so the ice is not made on the premises. No sickness problems for me. My wife was ill the third day but pinpointed the problem herself. Too much good food and unused to the quantity and variety she was consuming. We saw many people who seem to think sunblock is for others, take sunblock and use it. this is the tropics. The sun is strong. Overall, if you don't overindulge in food, drink, and sun the first 2-3 days you probably will not get sick. My wife and I have already decided we will return ASAP. We have never repeated a vacation, so this will be a first time to return to the same resort. Wonderful, relaxing time. (one complaint-I didn't catch a fish) oh well happens here too.Ron in Oklahoma City

<Content>Absolutely horrible in every way...except maybe the beach My fiance and I went here on a one-week vacation last year. Safe to say, we were disappointed. Upon arrival at noon, our room was not ready, which is not that big of a deal. But, we were told to come back at 2 PM, which we did, only to find nothing was still ready. At 3 PM, we got our keys, only to find out our luggage was missing from when we dropped it off upon arrival at the front of the hotel. After 15 mins, our luggage was found and we took the tram to our room. The room was still being cleaned! After a half hour, we went in to find two double beds when we had reserved one king. We called the front desk and were told another tram would pick us up to take us to another room, which took another half hour. When we got to the next room, there was no lock in our safe to store our personal items. So, we were really held hostage in the room for an hour before a staff member came with a replacement. On the third or fourth day, we came back to the room to find a huge puddle of water on the floor from our in-ceiling air conditioning unit. We called management, who sent a repairment to fix it that minute. The only problem was that we were getting ready to go to dinner and we then had shards of aluminum, concrete, and plaster all over our room, not to mention a greasy staff member in our room with our valuables that we did not trust. All in all, the management of this hotel is a joke.We agree that the beach and pool are adequate, though forget about finding shade on the beach. The chairs do not have covers for shade. Seating by the pool is not normally an issue.The food is, in a word, atrocious. My fiance got sick on the first day, and I got sick on the last. The food is NOT for Americans. You might find one or two items the entire week to stick with for breakfast and one or two restaurants for dinner. The only real restaurant is the Romantico, which is booked solid EVERY night. Best of luck if you're considering this resort.

<Content>loved it I'm a travel agent and just got back. All the reviews I read didnt do it justice. I found the hotel beautiful, the weather gorgeous. Most employees spoke English whenever I tried to speak Spanish. Had the best sushi in the Japanese restaurant and the best lobster in Marinos. I had two portions of both. The french restaurant was delicious. Easy to get around. The only fault is the rooms werent cold enough for me and at night its not very active. All the sports included were a blast. Recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>The Paradise I went to this Hotel in May of 2002 and August of 2003.....now I already book for August 2004...It is the best place for vacations, very nice and big pool, nice rooms ( they have new rooms with jacuzzi), lots of restaurants (Japonese and El romantico are very good, the Grill for burgers or hot dogs :) In the first year I went there i have problems, i went to Wc 10 times a day or more, I only drink botled water so I think was from the food but I was wrong, it is from the botled water. My wife bring to bottles from Portugal and she didn麓t have any kind of problems.....on the second year I bring water with me from Portugal....and i have no problems so....dont drink water from the botlle.The sun is very strong so be careful.Enjoy this Paradise

<Content>A great vacation! My husband and I went with 2 friends to celebrate our 40th birthdays. We went the week of 8-15th. It was raining when we arrived at the hotel and a couple of other times during the week (I guess that the month of May is the DR rainny season). The weather was mostly sunny and some clouds during the day wasn't always such a bad thing. It was a bit breezy and they ended up having great body surfing waves. It also kept you comfortable lying in the sun.The hotel is absolutely beautiful. The grounds, fountains, marble, statues... I can't say enough. The whole resort was VERY CLEAN. The staff was the friendliest people I have ever met in any of the islands I have visited and the hardest workers. It is the resort's greatest asset! I can't understand people complaining about the staff. We found them to be very attentive and timely! The bartenders (especially Ramone) were excellent and a lot of fun.Our rooms were great. They were clean and comfortable. There was a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. It was much nicer than the picture in the brochure. We were down by the left of the restaurants(looking at the beach) and pretty close to the ocean. I would recommend trying to get in this vacinity. It was very convenient!The food was good. As we expected, it was not like one of our favorite restaurants at home but you are in the Carribean. I was surprised that the Chinese restaurant was as good as it was. The Japanese and French were also very good. We ate in the Italian restaurant for lunch several times and had our share of bottles of wine each time! I'm not that big on buffets, but they did have a good variety for breakfast and lunch.The drinks were good and they were more than happy to fill your glass at all times. The only bad thing was that you could only get Presidente beer and when we ordered vodka a few times we were given rum (out of the vodka bottle...where the vodka was going... I don't know). The only reason that I am not giving the vacation a 5 is that there was a stomache issue with all of us. It was not bad enough to ruin the vacation, but it was a bit of a bummer for a couple of days. It was more of waves of nausea and not a down and out situation. We were careful eating certain foods but we did drink a lot. I'm not sure what did it. I now wish I had just gone for it all and hoped for the best. There were plenty of people who ate everything and were fine.I would definately recommend this resort. We really had a good time and a lot of laughs together and with the staff. They were fantastic.

<Content>A beautiful resort When to the Paradisus from May 8-15. We have traveled to Aruba (Holiday Inn), Antigua (Jolly Beach Resort), Cancun (Sun Palace), Jamaica (Sandals Inn), Punta Cana (Rui Bambu), and Riviera Maya (Oasis Puerto Aventuras). So I am comparing Paradisus to other resorts we have stayed at. The beach is great. Watersports included were kayaking and catamans. Horseback riding was included which was alot of fun. And the snorkeling trip included at the resort was very good. (We saw alot of fish.) The pool was super great. It was huge and by far the best pool we have had at a resort. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the resort is huge. We did not mind the walking. The food, needs improvement. The breakfast buffet is bad. (and this is usually our favorite meal at other resorts.) Lunch a couple of restaurants are open and they are ok. For supper the meals were good. We really liked the French restaurant and made reservations to eat there twice during the week. We had no problem with the language barrier, we are used to it and actually enjoy learning a couple new words on every trip. My husband did get alittle sick during the week (but he can't stay away from the fruit.) I was only sick for one day but I was very carefully about what I ate since we had been to Punta Cana before and been sick. Except for the food (breakfast and lunch), this resort is the best that we had stayed at. Please email me with any questions.

<Content>Best Vacation, ever! We returned from our Punta Cana vacation on May 24, 2004. Just want to let everyone interested in staying at the Paradisus how much we enjoyed our experience. Worst thing that happened, and we were forewarned through reviews like this, our room was not ready (two hours late). The good thing was, everyone there is so pleasant, there's so much to do and see, we were not all that upset. We traveled with another couple and there were a few things in their room that did not work (air conditioning, safe, mini-bar); no problem, they called and these items were taken care of immediately. The beaches were great, loved the pool (didn't see any debris floating in the water), the food was great (Romantico and Japanese were the best). It rained one day (all day), who cared! Still lots to do, or not do, and we took the time to relax and enjoy. We have been several places, and the Paradisus in Punta Cana was by far our best vacation experience. If you're considering going there, do it!! Have a great time!

<Content>Had a great time at the Paradisus Spa and Resort My husband and I just returned from a wonderful week-long vacation to the Paradisus Resort and Spa in the Dominican Republic (May 16-23). Like other people who'd booked the trip and then went online to read reviews, I was also worried. This was my husband's and my first vacation together after 8 years of marriage so I wanted it to be perfect. We were very impressed. The resort is beautiful, well-kept and not overwhelmingly large. We both thought the food was excellent. Our favourite place for dinner was the Italian restaurant, and for lunch the Palapa Grill. We didn't get to the Chinese because you need long pants for that one and my husband had shorts on. We did find that sometimes if you didn't get to the buffet right at opening (7 am) that sometimes some of the food was not hot, but later on in the morning after being replenished it was. The staff were very friendly and attentive, some knew more English than others, but we managed just fine. We did bring several US $1 bills to tip as we saw fit. The gym is small, but we were there when the resort was not filled to capacity. Fransisco, the personal trainer there was friendly and helpful. He's a big baseball fan. The resort lived up to its 5 star rating for us. Our room was clean, although perhaps it's worth it to upgrade to the Royal Service where you get a newly renovated room. We had 2 double beds instead of a King, but that was no big deal to us. All I can say is, if you're unpretentious and willing to take it all in - and relax - you will enjoy yourself immensly. The bus ride can be a bit long, especially if you're the last stop along the way but it's an opportune time to see how the DR people live inland and you see a real difference between that and the atmosphere of the resorts. We would certainly go back again.

<Content>Excellent facilities  Stayed at Paradisus May 8-16 using the Royal Service. Although it is a beautiful resort, (and I will discuss why) I don't think I would ever return there or anywhere in the D.R. until the fix this obvious problem that's causing people to get sick. But first I would like to provide my thoughts on many of the services and amenities. I would also like to say to the whiners out there, I concur with others who say that nothing would make them happy. Although I could sit here and complain about little things that didn't go my way, I've figured out long ago that life is way too short to worry about petty things. This is a big place with lots of staff, nobody's perfect. I would suggest that they look at their own workplaces to discover that they too can mess up sometimes. So relax!!ROOMS Very nice and AC worked well. Yeah the shower is a bit goofy, but who cares. Was always cleaned later in the day, but who cares. RESTAURANTSFood was okay but not great by my standards. Remember, everyone has different standards and that's all that matters. This is 5 Star in the D.R. but as far as food goes would not hold a candle to St. Martin or Aruba STAFF AND SERVICE Excellent!! These folks work their butts off. Sure we ran into a few with little or no personality but maybe the boyfriend left them that day. Who knows and who cares. They really try and it shows. By the way, we never got bothered by any sales people. The language, if you ask me, is what made the experience fun. We always managed and it made it fun. Bring a little dictionary. However, I would still add that these people should be taught more english. It's fine to say that this is their country but they are in the service industry and the majority of guests speak english. Don't compare places in the U.S. with a few spanish guests and no spanish staff. We're talking about alot of english to spanish ratio here. BEACHNo question it's very nice and the water is very warm. The wind is always blowing in so there's a 4 surf but it's fun. There only seems to be one bar so if you're not close, you've got quite a walk. Very little topless that week. Maybe 10%. Tons of chairs but it was a quiet week.SHOPPINGStay home! This is the worst I've seen at being harrassed. It was ridiculous. Fun at first but it won't take you long before you want out of there. They even cross the street to try and get you in their little shops and all have the same thing. There very nice but very pesty.CASINOStay home. This is not a casino by my standards. Sure it's small, I've seen lots of small casino's. It was like a big room with very little pizazz. A few slots and a few tables. Roulette, B.J. and a goofy Car. Stud. It was so pitiful that the cards were worn out. Was not very busy. I can see why.GOLFExcellent. Nothing more to say. POOL Beautiful. Warm. Bar is quite busy with only one bartender. Get two drinks at once and save yourself some time. ROYAL SERVICEThe jury is still out on that one. They take excellent care of you. Once you get the hang of it, you can use their service for everything from getting them to pick you up (instead of waiting) for a shuttle to bringing you candles and wine at 10:30 at night. They will do almost anything for you so get the hang of it and order room service from them specifically and tell them what you want. Tip them and it just keeps getting better. Ask for Wilson, he's the best. The private beach is nothing different but it's close to the bar and has the massage hut in it. The waiter service is really lacking but as I say, the bar is right there. The VIP lounge is very nice, washroom close to beach, 2 high speed internet and breakfast served. Use it! Staff is really attentive and personal. Call a week ahead and have them book all your dinners and golf etc... Ask for a room near VIP building in a front facing building. Anything less and you might as well be in any building because the rooms are really all the same. When you pull up to the main entrance, ask them to take you to VIP check in right away. It's a long ride. I say the jury is out because it's pricy. Some got a much better deal than us so shop it.GROUNDSAbsolutely beautiful. They never stop trimming etc... They should go to electric vehicles though as it would cut down the early morning noise. A four wheeler revving at 6 a.m. is a little annoying. I did find the property very spread out which makes for alot of walking. Shuttles are not always dependable.AIRPORTI read one review that said it was a grass hut with no food or drink. Uh, Hello! There's all kinds of eatery's, duty free etc. And it might be a grass hut alright, but it's the size of two football fields. It's open to the outside and really unique. It now has and A/C section. Security is another thing though. They couldn't get us through fast enough and when the buzzer went off for me, the dude frisked me briefly (grabbed outside my pockets) and sent me on my way. All I can say is, this whole system (airline security) is only as strong as it's weakest link! Needs some improvement there.There's not alot to do there besides relax which is okay but when the chips are down (rain 2 days) the D.R. has very little to offer. If you got hit with 3 or more days it would drive you nuts. For all it has to offer, I really cannot complain about the place. But here is why I don't think I'll return. I would say that 80% of the people I met had some form of an intestinal problem of one sort or another. For most of them, including myself, it was moderate to severe abdominal pain that occured from the ribcage to the belly button. This was not your usual cramps down low, this was different. For most I had met, it had been ongoing for at least 3-4 days. For myself, it was almost a week including 3 full days after returning home. My wife only got it for one day. I spoke to people who only drank beer and wine, others who didn't drink at all, and others who drank anything. It happened to all of them. I'm not a rocket scientist but I don't think it takes one to figure out that it's something in the food and/or water. We drank bottled water for everything, including teeth brushing to minimize exposure. I have wanted to go the D.R. for many years but the first hand reports from friends and from reading reviews has kept me away until I thought I'd give a whirl. We brought all the med's but to no avail. I think you can avoid all the food items you want that may have been washed with water but you have no control over all of it. You'll avoid salad but those veggies in you omelete may still get you. These resorts are huge and are making money, why can't they install water filtration systems to solve this problem? I don't understand this but I do underestand now why it's so inexpensive to go to the D.R. They have to do something. I don't want to bash the D.R. because I know other islands have this problem but I don't need it on my holiday. I can put up with alot of negative things, but not this. I could barely eat or drink the rest of the week. Why would I return? Use your own judgement and ask friends and form your own opinion. Maybe it was just a bad week but I'm not going to pay good money and throw the dice again.

<Content>Republica Dominicana is not in the USA I can麓t undertand how so many people wants to complain all the time about the lack of english speakers in the staff of the hotel. don麓t you know that in this country the Spanish is the official Language. Do you have spanish speakers in the staff of all the USA hotels? Of course not everybody complains about this item, but there are plenty of bad reviews for this item. Is you don't want to experience a different language please stay in your contry and don麓t miss your time complaining of people who do their best effort to understand your language. Note: I've been in USA as tourist, that's why I know english no body talk to me in spanish there!

<Content>Great Facility, Great Food, Good Service-- Average to Above Guests of the resort from May 1st to May 8th. As background, we have been to the Wyndham in Grand Cayman, Breezes in the Bahamas and Sandals Halcyon in St. Lucia. This is a little long, but I promise it is a 鈥榝air and balanced鈥?review!Overall; Great Facility, Great Food, Good Service.The facility was beautiful. Clean and well maintained. Pool was clean. People were always walking by and picking up cups as they went about their business. The room was very nice- clean and serviced by 3 everyday. We did have to ask for wash-cloths twice. Little gifts were left for us everyday (rum, candles, nick-knacks). Great AC. Spotty TV reception. No problem getting chairs by the pool. The beach does fill up early (around 9-10). Please note, there is a good deal of topless-ness at the beach and some at the pool. If you are American, and/or have an issue with this, you may want to reconsider. There were also about 陆 a dozen kids under 6 there. If you are not a 鈥榢id person,鈥?you might be annoyed- but we found them largely out of the way. It鈥檚 a pretty big place. There is a small casino by the lobby with some slots and table games.Small, expensive gift shop. Try to avoid getting change in Pesos- I had a wad of money for three dollars change (about 120 pesos!). The gift shop does have an uncanny way of 鈥榬ounding鈥?the bill up to avoid small change鈥?We did not leave the hotel for any excursions although there are many providers on site. Nice spa with a separate pool and workout room. All spa services (massages, facials, etc.) are extra. Service was good overall; staff was very friendly and accommodating. Language is an issue for things more detailed than simple directions or menu questions. Not much English is spoken at all. But note that Americans are a small number of the visitors- We encountered more Russian, French, and German visitors than fellow Americans. The staff was not fluent in any of those languages either. English is not a common language as it is in other Caribbean locations like Jamaica, Bahamas, Etc. - it IS another country, after all! They do give you a little Spanish language dictionary to help you out.Restaurants were very, very good- it is all a matter of YOUR PERSONAL tastes. My least favorite was the French and the Steakhouse. The Japanese (note, this is in a group setting of 12, around the Chef as he prepares your meals), Brazilian rotisserie, both buffets, Seafood and Italian were all good. My wife and I found the deserts in general were lacking. I did not like any of the breads, she did (I鈥檓 more 鈥榟oney oat鈥?she is more white bread!). Take note of the meal times- dinners start at 7, lunch from 12-4, breakfast from about 7-11 am. This is not really posted anywhere we could find and the room service hours are about the same, even though they show the times a bit differently. Make your reservations the next morning- they are needed but it is not a mad rush to get them in.I recommend trying different things to avoid monotony, although food items are largely unmarked- it鈥檚 mostly guessing! Lot鈥檚 of fish, meat, pastas, vegetables and fruits to choice from. Not all restaurants were open every night- signs were posted in the restaurant鈥檚 lobby bar (they are all located in the same place with a central bar/lounge area). Service was average to good- it just depends on your waiter(s), like any other place. A little more effort needed to get someone鈥檚 attention in the buffets after you are seated. Long pants are needed for the men in the evening and no bikini tops during the day. We found the drinks to be a little lacking - it is mostly due to the quality of mixers WE were used to. Top shelf liquors are available. The whites and rose wines are fine when they are chilled and you are eating up Paella in the late afternoon! Better wines cost extra. The giant coconut drinks are very good! Bartenders are all very friendly and working hard all day-The biggest negative was the sales pitch we got roped into by the Melia rep trying to get us to go to a breakfeast so they can talk about their own travel services and other resorts. This was before we got to the room! I also got a follow up call to our room where I kind of hung up on the guy. I sent them an email to complain.Last note- you can walk from the lobby to the pool in about three minutes- you don鈥檛 need to wait for the tram after you get settled in鈥?Enjoy your trip鈥?/p>

<Content>Horrible Horrible Horrible I have been all over the Dominican Republic as well as other areas on vacations. I have never been so disappointed. The resort itself is beautiful. The location is great. Everything else was horrible. The staff barely spoke a word of English. The food was horrible. I think I had one good meal the whole six days I was there. They had the worst bartenders in the world. I asked for a screwdriver and the bartender came back with a margarita. I stuck with the bottled beer, which wasn't even that great. Everytime I ate, I got pains in my stomach. I have been to three different resorts in the Dominican Republic and the food is amazing. We had a party of over 70 people there for a wedding. The wedding planner, which was hired through the resort was horrible. Nothing went right for the wedding except the weather. Very unprofessional. Not one of our party had a room ready when we were told we would have them...normal checkin time. I had strangers come into my room when I finally arrived which means they double booked our room and gave someone the key to our room. Major security problem. Save your time and money...and go to another resort...unless of course, you are okay with a two star hotel.

<Content>I would recommend this resort-taste of heaven. beautiful place. offered a variety of things to do. very european-which means services were catered to the european vacationers. restaurants are only open certain times  order from menu. dinner was not served until 7pm-all restaturants were closed from 3-7 and thats the time I usually eat dinner. you have to dress for dinner in all the restaurants. service in restaurants  bars was slow. housekeeping  guest services were fantastic. tips did go a long way.

<Content>Definitely NOT what we were expecting.... We stayed in the Paradisus for our Honeymoon Apr. 10-20, 04' - BIG MISTAKE. All of our friends recommended the hotel since they also spent their honeymoon there, what were they thinking???. Definitely, the hotel is overrated, NOT A 5 STAR, AT ALL!!!. PLEASE PLEASE get there after 3 pm, otherwise you will have to cruise around the lobby or change your clothes in the Concierge bathroom since your room won't be available till' 3 pm or so. The food not that great, stay away from the Japanese restaurant (YUCK). The only one that works fine for breakfast is the Hybiscus. The drinks, well, not a lot of options, and even if you are willing to pay $45-75 for a bottle of wine (that's all they have), still not a lot of options as you can see. Now, If you plan to take the tram from the lobby to your room after 10 pm, be ready to get a couple of drinks for the road because you will be waiting for a while, plus, it is very possible that you will not be dropped off where you need to. The staff very friendly, I can't complain, always working. The beach, great! the pool great! (if you don't mind swimming with straws and cups all over). I believe these 2 can be found anywhere so nothing expectacular about that.I was really, REALLY dissapointed....

<Content>Vacation Extraordinaire Our travel party was a group of 4 couples who have traveled together quite extensively and we all had to agree that for the money, this was one of our top 2 favorites. Another resort we have visited a couple of times is on Riviera Maya near Cancun---the Aventura Spa Palace. Every place we visit is compared with that as we always felt the grounds, the room, the food, and the service were extraordinary. The Paradisus compared very favorably in most aspects and we found the activities offered in the all-inclusive package were exceptional---as well as the beach. The golf initially lured us, but the included horseback riding and scuba diving were real deal sealers. Galloping down the beach with the turquoise Caribbean lapping the shoreline and the horse's feet is like a scene out of a movie. None of us were experienced riders but did just fine. The grounds of the resort are beautiful, we enjoyed the eco-park and photos we took with the birds on our arms or shoulders. The spa treatments were a highlight. Taking out the Hobie cats and sailing in the surf was a delight. The beach is a real keeper and great for romantic moonlit walks. The exercise and dance classes were great when we could fit them in. The pool and pool bar lured us in for a while each day. One lunch we ordered pizzas to go from the Italian restaurant and shared them by the pool. We found the food to be very good and the service generally top drawer. There were occasions when it was hard to get your coffee cup refilled, but no problem---we're on vacation. Knowing a bit more Spanish would have been helpful, but we got accustomed to the waiter smiling and nodding his head to our request, but we quickly learned that it didn't really mean he understood what you wanted. No problem---we're on vacation. We found we only needed reservations at 2 restaurants----the Japanese and French. Get them as soon as you arrive--- at the bar in the center of the Templo de Gastranomia---where most of the restaurants are. We managed to get in the last 2 days of our stay, but made the reservations on our second day. For Golf we were able to make reservations at the lobby guest relations desk for the following day. Once you get to the golf course you can reserve up to 3 days in advance. If you are going golfing fairly early, order room service breakfast and request a box lunch which you can pick up at the lobby check in desk on your way out. One member of our group had a birthday during our stay. We were at the steak house that night and told our waiter. They turned out the lights and came out singing and banging a drum and brought a candle covered torte. It was fun. We shopped at Plaza de Bavaro outside of the resort and found that to be an interesting experience. In buying a shorts and tee shirt outfit for my 5 year old granddaughter they quoted me a price of $30. When I nearly fainted they asked what was my maximum to pay. I told them $8 which they laughed at for a while but they continued to pursue the sale by attempts at bargaining but I soon walked out with the outfit for $8. It was an adventure in each of the shops. All in all it seemed a toss up between the Palace in Cancun and Paradisus----each had their strong points. In Punta Cana there are less activities and tours available outside of the resort. The crowd at each of them was a little younger than my 63 years, but nobody says I have to act my age. Enjoy!!!

<Content>Way Better Then Expected After reading several reviews on this site prior to going, I had my doubts about the selection. We went from 4-21 to 4-27. To start with, we have been to all-inclusives in Jamaica, Aruba, Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas. The paradisus was one of the best my family has visited. I'll be honest, the resort seemed half filled, so I could see how service might be a problem for those who want it NOW. The Carribean move an their own time and the DR is no exception. Here are some points to consider:Airport Customs - A breeze, 20 minutes tops with luggage. Van ride to resort - They supplied our own van direct to Paradisus. Check In - 15 minutes. Room - Spacious suite and in fact the staf moved furniture so 2 beds coud be added so my kids had their own. It was cleaned dail and the free (well all included) mini bar was replenished daily with soft drinks and bottled water. ( You could ask for beer in the mini bar). Did not see one bug in the room in 6 days. Food - Above average at the Japanese, Sea food, Il Romantica and the Brazilian, below average in the Italian. The buffets? Hey they are buffets. What do you expect. There was 24 hour room service, so ffod was never and issue. You are not going to get big city gourmet here, but you should be able to find something. Bars - Top shelf premium booze ( Stoli, Absolute, Grand Marnier, Drambuie, to name a few) and a pretty nice group of bartenders, especially at the swimup bar. Nightlife - Some shows but not great, but ok. Beach - Best we have seen in the Caribbean. Clean with waves, big enough to boogie board. Plenty of beach toys to try. Pool - Large and was like bath water around noon, a negative was after the happy hour lots of empty plastic cups. Too bad the slobs can't pick up after themselves. Service - Yep they don't speak much English here, but the last I checked the DR wasn't an English speaking country. The staff, however tried to help you, if they didn't understand, they tried to get someone who did both on the phone or at your table or bar. Golf at Cocotal - Good course not too hard. We played 3 times and it was good. Note: a $33.00 per person cart fee is charged. The run a shuttle bus that takes 15 minutes including speed bumps. Kid's Activites - Not much compared to Beaches ( We stayed there 3 times). In fact pretty poor. Note that there was plenty of shaded areas around the pool and beache so you could get out of the sun. Overall - To each his own but we would stay here again no problem. We were treated well beyond what we thought based on the reviews here. Good Luck

<Content>Loved Melia Paradisus My husband and I just returned from a 2 week vacation at the Paradisus, it was our first trip to Punta Cana, and our first time at a Paradisus hotel. We were blown away by the beauty of this place. We have travelled to Mexico, and other Carribean destinations and have always thought we were in wonderful places. But this place takes the grand prize. Both for the overall beauty of the place, the cleanliness, and the wonderful staff. Our room was very nice with a great view. We ate at all the resturaunts and enjoyed everyone. our least favorite was the Brazilian, and that was just because of how the food is served. You could not ask for nicer staff and even though the language issue migh seem huge its not if you make an effort. People who complain about this resort are the type of people who would complain about anything. We are already planning to go back in 2 years and cant wait

<Content>Go for the Fun and Relax Already Quality resort. Gorgeous pool, beautiful water, light Euro flavor (tasteful topless), terrific staff -- it added up to the best part of our honeymoon that included a number of other, more traditional islands. To the folks complaining about heat - why do you think it's so darn cheap to go in the Summer? That isn't Caribbean Time, Mon! And fair warning from other reviewers -- do not drink water unless bottled (We slipped the bell man $10 to bring us 2 cases of bottled water when we arrived. I used bottled to brush my teeth!) and do not eat veggies/fruits that would have been rinsed without a skin protectant (e.g. oranges that you peel, good; apples that you do not, bad). This is a poor country trying to make good. Their systems are a bit behind, and you are paying less to vacation here because of this. That all being said, I have never met nicer Islanders than those in Punta Cana. Everyone was genuine and sweet and very hard-working. We thought the food was above-par for an All Inclusive, the Italian restaurant is so fun - order a Bottle of White AND a Bottle of Red just for the heck of it! We met terrific people from NJ, PA and GA; all the Americans congregate around the pool bar mid-afternoon, you can pick em out. It's a very tolerant and paid back environment - friendly to folks from all walks of life, and that makes it all the better!

<Content>relaxing vacation Just returned home from the Paridisus. The resort is beautiful. Our room was very nice and clean. The biggest problem is the laguage. If you don't know any spanish it can get very frustrating but the staff are very friendly and tryed to accomadate our every need. There are a lot of foreigners but we met some americans also. The beaches are beautiful we did have trouble a couple of times getting chairs but for the most part it wasn't a problem. The food at all the restraurants is fabulous. The buffets are a little scary but if you arrive early when they just put out the food then it's better. The weather was beautiful there seemed to always be a nice breeze blowing. Overall I would recommend going just keep in mind that you are not in America and some things are a little different. Also find Luiz (He runs the hotel) He was a great help.

<Content>Paradisus Translates to Paradise My husband, daughter, and I absolutely loved our week at the Paradisus at Punta Cana. We had never been on a tropical vacation before, so we had nothing to compare it to. The resort is breathtakingly beautiful. When we arrived there and saw the beach, I was amazed at how blue the water was. Although we arrived at the resort before check in time, the staff was accommodating by holding our luggage and allowing us to enjoy the pool and plan our dinner reservations for the week. Every single meal was delicious. The variety of foods offered for breakfast and lunch was better than any buffet that I have seen the the US. My daughter became addicted to paiella for lunch or snack every afternoon. We really felt that it was a great deal because we were always satisfied and never had to worry about carrying money around while wearing swim suits all day.In addition to relaxing at the pool or beach, dinners were the highlight of our day. El Romantico was our favorite; although, we had a pleasant experience every night. After having a delicious meal with complimenting wine, we went to see the entertaining shows in the lobby. The shows weren't as professional as Broadway - but the dancers were talented and we thoroughly enjoyed the music and the culture all around us. It was a lot of fun for the whole family.We were lucky enough to have traveled with friends that had been there previously, because they warned us about the most stressful part of the day... choosing a spot to sit on the beach or near the pool. The only other thing to worry about is applying sunscreen!!! The friends we traveled with speak Spanish which was a plus, but we were able to communicate most of the time without any problems. Overall, our impression of the Dominican people was that they are friendly, happy, hard-working people.We look forward to going back again as soon as we can!!!

<Content>Wonderful Resort We were at the Paradisus Mar.27-Apr.3. The resort is beautiful and very well maintained. The resort staff (all of them) are efficient, helpful, eager to please and very friendly. The accommodations were fine, the food was good, the number and selection of restaurants was great and the bars were excellent in both quality and service. The bartenders are great (special thanks to Francisco) and knew their stuff. As for activities, we played golf four days and enjoyed both the course and the service. The beach is gorgeous and the free- form pool is fantastic with a great swimup bar. We didn't experience any problems with beach and pool chairs and lounges as some have mentioned. We may have been lucky as I think the resort was about 60-70% full the week we were there. We met some great people and had a lot of fun. The lobby is the place to be at night for the shows and the lobby bar. We really enjoyed our vacation at the Paradisus and would definitely recommend it to others.

<Content>Loved the place We just returned from spending one week at this resort. All I can say is that we had a wonderful time. Granted the food wasn't terrific but I didn't care. They was plenty of water sports to do or you could lounge around and soak up the sun. The grounds are beautiful. Our room was by the pool which is convenient to most restaurants and the beach. The beach is lovely. My kids enjoyed it very much. Romantica had the best food. But be forwarned, you need to make a reservation so make one the day you arrive. Would I go back again, yes!!!

<Content>But the chairs on the beach.... The Hotel is very fine, the meal A1 but this hotel does not care about the people who want to enjoy the beach or the swimming pool. There is a lack of chair and the customers reserve their chair from the middle of the night.I will never come back here again.

<Content>All You Need to Know About Paradisus I am not a travel agent or a hotel employee, just a tourist who took his family there from March 26 - April 2, 2004. I had some misgivings after having read some of the messages written about this place (and some concerns about the effect of the Haiti situation). As you can see, I (and my family) give Paradisus a 5 out of 5 rating. With the exception of one rainy day, everything else was just about perfect. Paradisus is on a very large piece of land that includes a beach. The grounds are very lush an immaculately maintained. The staff -- even including the groundskeepers -- are very friendly, always giving one a smile and helping when they can. One morning, I left our room (a nicely appointed junior suite; AC worked fine) to go to the Habiscus restaurant (where breakfast is served) to get coffee and cream for my still-sleeping wife and me. Seeing that I was having trouble negotiating the two plastic cups of coffee and cup of cream, one waitress volunteered to carry one of the cups of coffee all the way back to my room. Pool is very large and clean. Some music is always coming from the swim-up bar (they even play CD's brought by the guests, so we heard Motown one day), but is not piped all over the place, so if you want relative quiet, just pick a lounge chair away from the swim-up bar. We had an all-inclusive package that lived up to its name. This included meals with decent wine (food was average to good, our favorite was La Romantico -- get reservations early) top shelf liquor, room service (which we sometimes brought to the pool), horseback riding, scuba at the property, use of a sailboat and golf (very nice, long course, 27 holes; had to rent carts at US$33 per person or so). Consequently, checking out was without sticker shock, since the only things on the bill were some special wine we bought with our meal one night (mostly we stuck with the included stuff), telephone calls and some trinkets we bought in the gift shop. Some caveats: the staff is not fluent in English -- about like the maids in a hotel in New York or Florida, but I found this to add to the charm of the place. The waiters and maitre d's were pretty good with English, so ordering meals wasn't much of a hassle. We tipped the maid when we got there and it may have helped us with our supply of clean towels and the supply of bottled water an soft drinks in the mini frige in the room. No one got sick, even though some of us drank water from the sink in the room. If you're nervous, bottled water is plentiful on the property and we drank a lot of it, mostly because of the convenience. Also, the Paradisus has a large contingent of European guests, which means that you (and your kids) are going to see some women sunbathing and walking around the pool and beach topless, and little kids running around the place naked. Other things to note: The place also had a modest-sized casino with the usual games; no kids allowed. The place did not seem very crowded, but this could be due to the Haiti situation or the time we went, since we were told before we left that it was sold out. We stayed near the pool, which was where most of the restaurants were and was close to the beach. Little trams took us to and from the main building, but most of the time we walked since it wasn't all that far. Because of the large number of palm and other trees and shrubs, it felt like walking through a park. On the rainy day, we walked to a nearby market and did some shopping -- sharpen your negotiating skills! my daughter bought a silver (I hope) bracelet for US$25 that was offered for US$65 originally. My daughters, who perhaps are more critical than I, are still talking about how much fun they had and how they can't wait to go back. Me too.

<Content>Three years, three great trips We have gone to the Paradisus three times to get away from Michigan winter, and we have greatly enjoyed every trip. Can't wait to go back. Staff and guests are very friendly, staff treats you as a good friend. Friendliness makes up for occasional lapses, by staff or guests. Guests from all over the world, which we like. No race sensitivity. Golf course is good, and another should be finished within 6 months. All restaurants are good, no wait walk-in for all but two: French and Japanese, and no trouble getting reservations for them. Bars are good, with premium liquor if you want. Great beach. Great pool, with swim up bar. Great landscaping. Great beach walking. We just loaf with a little golf and go with the flow, like everyone else.

<Content>Caveat Emptor!! Just returned from Paradisus Punta Cana and would not go back. We were with a group of people and half of us got sick sometime during the week with diarrhea and or vomiting. the outward appearnce of the environment was very clean but based on the fact that so many of us became ill was concerning. The food is mediocore and very reptetive from one restaurant to the next. The Italian place is dangerous from a food standpoint. Be very careful what you choose to eat. I drank alot of bottled water and wine! The staff was friendly but spoke little english. They don't give you wash cloths to bath with just large hand towels so take you own!!One should learn basic spanish before going. The beach was beautiful and it is topless so if you are offended by bare chested women of ALL ages do not go. The ride to the resort and back to the airport is a bit unnerving but I am not sure that is much different thatn any other carribean country. My spouse played golf at teh Cocotal golf course and was impressed. We were on an all inclusive deal but he had to pay $30+ for a golf cart which is mandatory.There are better countries in the Carribean so this was my firsdt and last visit to DR

<Content>Wouldn't return if you paid me Would never return here - it was a vacation horror. I went last year in early summer. If you can't stand heat, do not go here. It was so humid and hot all the people from NY were complaining. Our room was nice but the air conditioning was barely adequate. We got an all inclusive and were told we should book restaurants when we first got there and that we had several restaurants to go to. We immediately went to do this, yet all the better restaurants were booked and we had to eat at outdoor buffets almost every night - when we complained (and others complained) no one cared. Be forewarned - only a few restaurants are inside and air conditioned (barely). By the way, all entertainment etc is outdoors also, except the casino. These were the restaurants that were already booked upon arrival. If you don't mind pouring sweat at every mealtime, this place is for you. I wondered about the safety of the food being out in this extreme heat and humidity. I started to get ill toward the end of my vacation. I was very sick by the time we left. Turns out I had food poisening from some type of bacteria. My white blood cell count was so high it took 2 antibiotics and a fungus medicine and one month to get better. There is hardly anyplace to go outside the resort - it's all jungle. There was a smaller shopping area that the resort says you MUST take a cab to because it is dangerous to walk outside the resort. That was it. And if you don't like topless beaches - don't go here. Our travel agent said the resort said that the beach was NOT topless, but it was. The pool was too. The guests are mostly Europeans. I couldn't wait to leave. When we got on our plane, we sat for almost 1 hour on the runway, with the plane off and the heat building up in the cabins. The reason for this, we were told, is that one of the passengers had passed out from heat in the open air airport (there is NOWHERE to get away from heat near this resort). We had to wait as they were treated and brought back to the plane. By then, people were almost panicky from what must have been at least 120 degree heat in the plane cabin. Some people, including myself, almost passed out by the time the plane finally was turned on and air conditioned. As fancy as the Paridisus looks, this trip was the ultimate nightmare and I would NEVER return.

<Content>Beautiful resort for Europeans..... What a beautiful resort. I have never seen a better place. I want all Americans to understand a few things that are not entirely negative but surprising. One out of three workers speaks no english. One out of three speak a little. We were there 6 days and met 3 Americans and 3 Canadians who spoke english. The dinner food at the 10 restaraunts was incredible. Take long pants guys or you can't eat at the restaraunts!!! The Hibiscus buffet for breakfast and lunch was not great. Nothing was labeled on most days, and most food was odd to america. (tomato soup with squid and mussels) etc. Food safety is not known there. The grill cook gave me a fillet off the grill with tongs he just used to put raw fish, chicken and beef onto the grill. I put the meat back. We had money taken out of our zipped carry on. We reported it and were told it was our fault for not locking it up. Our bags and personal items were looked through daily. After the theft I did little things to see if they opened the bags and they did. The hotel manager never apologized. Bavaro splash was awesome but they sold a DVD of us snorkeling for $40 and when we got home it was not us. I think they need to update the staff before I would return to Paradisus.

<Content>smiles but total ineficiency First surprise: the hotel had been changed because of !overbooking! We (9 people) were transferred to other Melia hotel, less rated than Paradisus. No explanations at all. At this hotel the rooms were not yet available, even they did not know we were to arrive. That meant 3 hours more of lobby. The passive behaviour of the staff is the problem. They say yes to everything but nobody takes really care of the demand. Desperatingly we had to arrange the transportation to Paradisus the next day. When arriving at Paradisus hotel, needless to say, the rooms were not yet available, so we had to wait until 4 PM to get finally to our rooms. If you want a beach chair in the shadow you have to stay at the beach before 8AM. I expected more chairs available in such a luxury hotel. The food is really good in almost every restaurant. The Romantico is a must but make reservation asap. The staff is friendly, may be too friendly but it seems to be the caribbean way of life. Ineficieny is unbeliveable even considering the caribbean standards. Probably the problem is not the hotel itself but the staff lack of professionality.

<Content>Five Star, Best of Punta Cana Absolute Best of Punta Cana. Excellent Service, friendly staff. I spoke to many members of the other resorts and knew that the Paradisus was by far the best. Grounds were immaculate. 10 restaurants gave great variety. Top shelf liquor was included. For children, there was a play area, kiddie pool, and kid's workshops. For bigger kids (21+), there was a pool bar and an on-site club. For adults, there was plenty of activities and a full spa. For older adults, there was plenty of peace and quiet enjoyment of the beauty that was the Dominican Republic. This place had it all.What to Expect: One Dominican Republic minute equals five American minutes or thirty New York minutes. Just relax and go with it. If you want faster service, tip. English is the SECOND language. The staff is very patient and friendly. They will find someone who speaks English if the conversation gets too complicated. Food is not very spicy. Do not choose foods that you think should have a lot of spice in them, they won't. The casino is very small. 4 BJ. 2 Carribean Poker. 2 Roulette. 20+ slots.

<Content>Simply unimaginable experience My wife and I went on our honeymoon to Paradisus and this place is just like in my first sentence Unimaginable. This resort is probably the best resort I've been to. My wife fell absolutely in love wanting to return as soon as we can afford it. The resort itself is tranquil, clean , well organize, clean beaches, great food and wonderful hospitality. The rooms housekeeping is the best I've seen and the staff absolutely helpful to your needs. Since this was our honeymoon everytime we left the room and return the staff would decorate our room with flowers or petals and place towels organized in shapes of hearts which was very thoughtful. Our minifridge was always stocked daily . Though before we went I had read negative reviews but I suppose there are just people that you just can't satisfy no matter where they stay. I recommend this place fully and even though everything is included you cannot believe what a liitle tip as a show of thanks can get you with the waiters and bartenders. Enjoy!!

<Content>I would recommend this resort to all! This was one of the nicest resorts that my husband and I have ever stayed at. The rooms are spacious, the grounds are huge and well taken care of! The food was good, but better in the smaller restaurants, as opposed to the buffet. The pool is very large with a lively swim up bar. The beach is very big with lots of things to do. The casino is very small, so don't go into this thinking Vegas, and I don't think anyone ever won any money. The Dominican Republic, in itself was so beautiful, and we found our stay there to be fun, enjoyable, and affordable. Be sure to do some of the tours of the countryside, in the Big Trucks! Very informative and scenic. Have fun!

<Content>Weekend in paradise!! 2/19-22/04 I must state that I was nervous about our trip to Paradisius, Punta Cana after reading several posts about the resort. All I can gather is that some people just want to complain! We went with a group of couples from Thursday to Sunday! ? First, the resort and grounds were magnificent, absolutely stunningly beautiful. Clean wide beaches with beautiful blue water, a fabulous pool and deck, and lovely open-air verandas (like the lobby) to relax and enjoy the weather. Our room was clean and fresh and the weather was so perfect that we barely used the air conditioner. Not a bug in site. We dined at most of the restaurants and found them all very nice. The meals ranged from average to fabulous. However, we never had to wait in line for any meals nor did we have to tip heavily to get a table. (We learned at the airport that several guests at nearby resorts had these experiences). We tried all types of food from octopus to local fruits and veggies and no one got sick. Some of our meals were just average - so what. If you are looking to pig-out and eat non-stop go on a cruise! We loved just getting up and saying thank you ? no bill!!! The bars were generous, and quick with service of premium wines and liquor. If you are interested in dining at the higher end restaurants, I would suggest making reservations before you go. Please remember folks that you are in a foreign country and not everyone does things the way Americans do. This was all part of the charm to us. I loved hearing all of the blended voices during breakfast, there were guest from US, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and quite a few from Argentina. This is a global resort. The staff was courteous and extremely helpful. We took a supply of $1 bills with us for tipping. We never felt as though it was expected or required. ? Which I think you feel at almost any American, Mexican or Jamaican resort. I rate Paradisius, Punta Cana 4 stars out of 5 for the following reasons. Some of our group were not able to get into the higher end restaurants at the times they wanted ? we were warned to make reservations first - they didn?t. I did not care for the time share people stationed around the pool ? although all we did was smile and say no thank you and they did not pursue us further. You do need to put your towel on a beach chair early in the morning to get one ? but if you have ever been on a cruise you are used to that. It took a while to know what activities and restaurants were available at which times. I am used to resorts which publish daily activity guides. And last but not least when we arrived at about 2:00 our rooms were not ready until 3:00 or so ? I would suggest taking your bathing suit in your carry-on and going straight to the beach while they ready your room. Would I go back? Absolutely!

<Content>This resort is paradise My spouse and I were are the Paradisus resort from january 23 to January 30 2004. It was the best vacation we've had. We've been to several resorts in Mexico, Cuba but this all inclusive was the best. The people were friendly the food was very good, the grounds were beatiful and well kepted. This is not a resort for those who are looking for noisy MCs screaming in a microphone all day to keep guests busy. It's laid back, a place to relax and enjoy the good things in life, (good food, good wine, good people, nice sights). While at the hotel if you have any problems ask to speak to Mr. Legreaux (front desk manager) he will do all he can to make your stay enjoyable. The resort manager is Miguel, I do not know his last name but very down to earth, friendly man and ready to help if you need it. This resort has 500 junior suite spread over a large piece of land but you do not feel crowded. There are no line ups for dinning and out of the ten restaurant there are only two which require reservation. During our stay we did not hold back on the type of food we ate and we were not sick ( in case this worries you). There were not bugs in the rooms. When you check in, make sure you do not get a gungalo along the left most side of the resort, the neighbouring resort is very noisy with their music and MCs).As for tipping, this is an all inclusive resort and tipping is not required, the staff does not make you feel like you must tip them. But bring some U.S. dollars when you feel the service deserves more then a thank you.The Paradisus may be more expensive than some other resorts but it's well worth the extra cost.

<Content>Still the best I have been to this hotel 4 times,it is excellent. Recently stayed at another hotel in the same area, not up to the same standard, wished all the time that we had gone back to the Paradisus.No Hotel is perfect all the time, but the Paradisus is the nearest you are going to get. Looking to book for next year.

<Content>Wonderful Had a great time at the Paradisus. The most recent reviews are accurate and describe the beauty of the surroundings. Until you are there you cannot imagine the setting around this hotel. The ocean is also beautiful but watch the waves and make sure your eyeglasses are secured of they can be swept away.The resort has a wonderful pool and pool bar as well the lobby bar was fun. Eash nught at 10:15 a show and prior to that live msuic for dancing. The casino and disco are also in the lobby area. The resort had excellent drinks including Baileys, Port, etc. A favourite was the Coco Loco made in the fresh coconuts that were cut down from the trees in the morning. At lunch or dinner when ordering wine in any of the sit down restaurants bottles were delivered in silver ice buckets. A choice of various wines and most were excellent. The people visiting really made our stay fun - Detroit, New Jersey, Vancouver, Montreal and especially the lady from N York who spoke Spanish to the delight of the staff.Learning a few words like - gracias just adds to the holiday. Take along some insect repellent if needed. I packed some Febreeze but did not need it as our room was lovely and clean with no smells.We packed some summer shirts, a ball glove and hand lotios, etc and gave these to a few staff. Also brought small bills for tips.Before leaving we had read the reviews and they were a downer for the most part. I think that the vast majority of people are happy with this resort and in awe of this paradise but are not posting reviews. To the others who are focussed on the negative, I would suggest to stop and look about you at the wonderful surroundings, the majestic palm trees, beautiful hibiscus flowers and the staff who are trying to do their very best to please you and then count your blessings,A

<Content>Paradisus was paradise! Like most people I was sceptical about this resort because of the variety of reviews. Fortunately, we've been to Punta Cana and various Carribean islands and understand their capabilities/standards and have reasonable expectations as a result. First tip, take a cab from the airport. Rather than stop at 4-5 resorts before getting to yours you'll be there, in your shorts at the bar before everyone else. It's worth the $10-20US. This resort is spectacular! It has everything. Tons of food options, bars, casino, disco, karyoke, shows etc. Top notch booze and wine and lot's of both. The place is huge! Free Marlboro smokes and hand rolled cigars too! It's on a great beach will nice warm, aqua-blue salt water. White sand that stretches for miles. The rooms are okay and the service is slow but pleasant. Other than those 2 items I can't think of anything bad or negative to say. If they worked on them, there would be no argument that this would be a 5-star resort. Either way, probably the best that Punta Cana has to offer. We'll be back (can't wait!!). Relax, try it and you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Awesome Trip I will begin by stating that I was at first nervous about our trip due to several of the negative reviews -- However -- we only had great experiences and very few negatives.The trip from the airport took about 30 minutes to reach the Paradisus. The lobby is set apart from the rest of the resort. The lobby contains a large bar and the casino. It also houses the Mexican restaurant and the El Romantico(sp?) is right next door. The Casino is medium sized and contains ~6 blackjack tables, 2 caribbean Poker tables and ~2 Rolutte tables. Also - has ~20 various slot/Poker machines.The room we stayed in was right next to the pool and about a 2-3 minute walk to the beach. The rest of the restaurants are centerd in beween the pool area and the beach.Room - Was very decent size -- and clean. We did notice some ant like bugs in the sink when we arrived but were probably from the fresh flowers that were left out for us. Once we got rid of the flowers we had know more bugs. Room service had about a 30 minute turn around. Beers had to be orderd through room service. 4/5 starsFood - I would descibe the food as better then your normal chain restaurant (TGI Fridays) but not as good as a dinner out downtown. Favorite - Mexican and the steak place. Booze - Top notch. I would order a gin and tonic and they would give me Bombay gin. 4/5 stars.Beach/Pool - Get there before 9:30 am and you will have a your pick of spots on the beach/and or pool. Also - They have plenty of shade for my fellow Irish brethren out there :) 5/5 starsStaff is very accomodating and friendly. Not as many Americans as I would have thought (about 20%). Go for a good relaxing time and you will have just that. Kick back - have a drink and smile -- because before you know it you will be heading back to the the real world.

<Content>A Pleasant Getaway... My husband and I just got back from our 6 day 5 night stay in DR. I looked on this site MANY times before leaving and I am not going to lie, I was totally freaking out before our trip that I made such a big mistake with selecting this hotel. Let me get straight to the point. Food was mediocore. I was VERY cautious about everything I ate, because I knew of two people who left their vacations early because they got sick from the food. This is not a 5 star hotel in regards to food, but I might be spoiled from great home cooking and great resturants in NY. Other guests felt the food was good. I ONLY drank bottled water and tried to stay away from ice. As for service, at times they did forget what I requested, soda, coffee, etc... and other times they were on top of me. I think they were just limited with the help in most of the restuarants and that made it hard for them to cater to everyone. At times, we ended up with the wrong food or side dish, because they did not speak English, but we did not make a stink and as long as it was edible and we liked it, we ate it. The room was great, except for the mildew decorative pillows on the bed, but I just placed them on the floor. Our AC leaked a little bit, but we never complained. Our room was made everyday and we always had a supply of towels, not wash rags (weird). Other guests that we became friendly with did complain that they had bugs in the room (not roaches, but crickets), their bed sunk in the middle, TV broken, etc. We happen to be lucky and had only minor complaints, which we never even brought to the attention of the hotel. The pool, beach and premises are absolutely BREATHTAKING, A TRUE PARADISE! This alone kept our spirits up the whole entire trip and nothing could get us down. The staff is always TRYING VERY HARD to please, even if they do not understand English AT ALL. Bring a Spanish/English Dictionary, it will help. The shows and late dancing were always fun. Do not expect to hear much American music, mostly Spanish, which was fun, but sometimes I needed a break. The only place I was able to hear American music was when the pool bartender Hector was always nice enough to throw on some Bob Marley for us. The people staying at the hotel made the trip fantastic as well. We met so many nice people from NJ, MI, NY,CA and Canada, and we had a great time at the pool everyday with them. The drinks were SUPURB, they had top shelf liquor and by all means they were geneous. I was addicted to the Paridisus drink. Also, if you book with the travel agent and she/he tells you you are 20 minutes from the airport, you are, but the bus stops at every other hotel also on the island which gets you to the hotel about an hour after leaving the airport, or you have to leave an extra hour early to get to the airport. Take a cab if you want to get to the hotel premises quicker. Would I go back right away? No. I would try other islands first, but it was an easy and quick get away, which was convenient for us NY commuters. Overall, I had a great time depsite the language barrier and food. This is not a 5 star hotel, but is the best on the island for sure. We heard complaints on the bus about the other hotels on the island being worse then ours. I am used to a 5 star in Hawaii, Vegas, etc, and there is just no comparison. Like I said ealrier the island is GORGOEUS! I think if they worked on a few of their flaws, this could be an amazing island, 5 star! If you have any further questions, I would be more than happy to help. My e-mail address: nettya812@aol.com.

<Content>Super!!! January 25, 2004What can I say that would pay justice to the Paradisus Punta Cana? Great rooms, pleasant staff, good food and premium liquors all included in the price. Its quite a large complex, but trams run continually and even more frequently during the rush hours. Most of the restaurants are located within a small area. Since we are American and used to eating around 7:30, and the Europeans eat later, we were able to walk into any restaurant we desired without waiting. There are so many good places to eat that it is difficult to rate one higher than the other. Ah, and then there is the golf course. Really nice by Caribbean standards. Three nine hole courses that are well kept and managed with precision. Playing the white and red nines from the white tees account for 6875 fun filled yards. Some holes are quite open and then on the other handsome are kind of tight. The workers will sell you all the balls you want for fifty cents each. The refreshment cart tends to only come around once in 18 holes so fill up when he comes by. We always made a sandwich at breakfast and took it with us to the course. Sounds silly, but it really hit the spot on the turn. Book your tee times before leaving home or you are liable to find yourself playing very early or very late. The shuttle from the hotel is always on time. It is a twenty-minute trip to the course over some roads that give new meaning to the word bumpy. You can store your clubs at the course for $5.00 for the entire length of your stay, which is the only way to go. The only down side is that it costs $66.00 to rent the cart each time you play. Well you didnt come here to save money did you? Tipping is OK, but no one has their hand out. We normally gave the kid who took care of the clubs a dollar a bag to clean them and he was always most grateful. As I say no one had his or her hand out.The casino at the hotel is nice, but the slots seemed a little tight. Video Poker took separate tokens and were fifty cents a pop. Black Jack started at $5.00 and moved up. Crowds were moderate and we didnt feel cramped. Only American money is accepted. Cigars were free, but they were not just lying around. You had to ask and then it took a minute as they had to into a vault, I think, but the wait is worth it. Very good, hand made cigars.We flew out of Windsor, Ont. And saved real dollars.We are going back next year!L.N. Detroit

<Content>Beautiful Resort My wife and I just returned this weekend from Paradisus, Punta Cana. I had reviewed posts for months prior to our trip. Many more positives to be said about this resort than negatives. Yes, you had better rise early to save a chair by the pool and even then you may get it or not. If you are not in your chair by the pool before 8:30, someone else may just take the chair and move it. Take enough small bills to make tips. Very difficult to break large bills so that you can tip bell-hops, bartenders, maids, etc. Also, be forewarned that there are many gentlemen walking around the resort soliciting vacation club memberships. These are actually time-share opportunities. We were approached by a very friendly man after arriving who offered to give us a brief orientation and tour which was nice. However, after pulling out his brief-file and informining us of the vacation club and asking us to schedule a morning excursion to a meeting being held closeby that would occupy basically a half day (90 min. presentation in addition to 40-60 min. transfer), we were extremely bothered. This individual scouted for us the rest of our stay, until I finally offered to just compensate him whatever amount he would have made in commission had we attended. It was as if there were hundreds of him as he was in our face every time we turned around. He refused to be paid, but made us feel guilty with some of his statements. The restaurants are great, the service is excellent throughout all of this resort from bartenders to security staff (I could not open my in-room safe). The front desk remembered our names each time we passed! Also, a very nice casino. It is a laid-back environment, so just expect this and enjoy. We will definitely return again.

<Content>paradisus, punta cana Unbelievably dissapointed. Been all over the carribean (with family). Beautiful place but that's it. Service was the worst e.g. had to fight to get towels, had to be out by 7:00 to get chairs, on first day went to book restaurants (Sunday morning) and was only able to get a reservation at 10:00 PM Tues for the Japanese restaurant and a Fri. reservation for the French. Other restaurants were walk in and it was a major problem for my group of seven. The majority of the workers didn't speak English at all. Walkways for guests were also used constantly for employee vehicles. Everything from bicycles to scooters to trucks. Major annoyance. Never posted message before but had to now!!

<Content>ot was just OK I went to the Paradisius for a wedding with about 70 other guests. The resort was beautiful, but there was a tremendous amount of construction happening at all hours of the day and night. We were awakened every morning around 9am by the sound of chop saws strategically placed directly outside our room!!We arrived around 1pm and were not able to check into our rooms until 4pm. Most guest had to wait until at least 3, some did not even get a room at all! The hotel made arrangements for rooms at a nearby hotel - which was totally unacceptlable as we all had had resevations for at least 6 month prior to our arrival! Our room had a strong muggy odor and the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower. The room was cleaned on a daily basis, and although they took our drenched towels away,(a result of drying the puddles in the bathroom) they did not replace them with clean ones - here is a tip: get clean pool towels and bring them back to your room - you will need them! The food was OK, and the service was also OK - definitely NOT 5 stars!!

<Content>Magical Paradise My husband and I got back from the Paradisus Punta Cana Dec 20, 2003. We had a wonderful time while we were there. The service and food was top notch. The property was breathtaking and gorgeous. The staff were friendly and always there to help make your stay better and comfortable. The rooms were spacious and tastefully decorated. Our room had a musty smell as we entered it for the first time. However, as soon as the fan and air was turned on the smell began to disappear. We brought candles to help with the smell and this helped too. We also brought raid,...just in case and did not have to use it. There was some construction taking place at the resort. The construction did not interfere with any of our activities, however some guests were not pleased with the noise. We had no problems with it. We e-mailed the guest services desk before we arrived and made dinner reservations before hand. My husband also booked his tee times in advance. On the day we arrived we went straight to the guest services desk and arranged for breakfast to be delivered to our room every morning,....my husband 's tee times were for 7:00 a.m. and he had to have breakfast before 6:00 a.m. , so the in room breakfast worked out beautifully. We brought travel mugs with us, which allowed him to take his coffee to go. Perfect for the shuttle ride to the golf course. The golf course was apparantly very nice. Overall the vacation was perfect. We loved every minute of it. We made up our minds to go with the flow and not get worked up about anything. We would definitely go back to the same resort. Finally, the weather was AMAZING!!! I spoke with a friend who went away the same week, but to Cuba and she said that it rained a bit and that it was chilly. Punta Cana was perfect. Between 30-35 degrees celcius and sunny. Perfect for kayaking, boogie boarding and swimming.

<Content>Christmas at Paradisus We recently visited Paradisus (December 16-20) and were impressed on many fronts. I had read many reviews from this site and was very confused at the conflicting reviews. We have traveled to over a dozen Caribbean islands in the last few years and have stayed at many all inclusive resorts. We have stayed at several Solmelia resorts as well as Sandals, Iberostar, Wyndam and Beaches to name a few.For those who do not wish to read all of this below is the 1-10 ratingResort overall 8 Guest Relations 9 Room 9Dining 7 Pool 8 Beach 7 Bar/Drinks 8Positive factors: Beauty, service, room serviceNegative: Many French and Germans (some with attitude and no concept on when not to go topless) Need to speak some Spanish for full benefitOur stay at Paradisus is near the top of our list. The check-in process was smooth and without problems. The staff was willing to adjust our room location to something closer to the beach. We did not move because the receptionist informed us that even though the building was at the back of the property, it was quit and only about out a minute to the beach. He was correct on all accounts.The room was impeccable and well above average for all inclusive suites. It consisted of a king bed (bed was average comfort for any resort which means it is too firm and uncomfortable). There is a separate bath/toilet/shower and vanity /closet area. It is equipped with a blower dryer and iron/board. There is a safe in the closet. On a lower level from the sleeping area, there is a sitting area with a sofa and love seat, decorated in floral pattern on rattan furniture. In this area there is a dresser with 3 drawers and a small refrigerator (which by the way did cool drinks very well after you plug it in). This area looks out into a garden and has a sitting area with wicker chairs and a table. The room as windows on two sides as well as a ceiling fan. The AC was good and at times we had to lower the settings. Robes are provided and one day we did not get hand towels. WE NEVER SAW A SINGLE BUG IN THE ROOM....I would however bring sunscreen with insect repellant as the grounds have many pools and fountains and I did see some mosquitoes.The grounds were impeccably maintained and pleasing to the eye. There are many trails and even a wildlife area with birds and lizards, some in cages and some loose. The property is expansive and the resort has busses roaming the property to take you from the beach area to the lobby area. This was not routinely needed and the walk would have been several minutes any way. Most of the things you are looking for are not at the lobby anyway.Dining was certainly above average. Breakfast and lunch was the standard buffet but the selection as excellent. Dinner was well above average. We had dinner at Romantico, French cuisine that was above average in taste and presentation. We also ate at the steak house and the Brazilian meat house both we average above average. Service at all the bars and restaurants was certainly above average. They even toss in 24 hour room service for free and service was excellent.The beach was breezy and open. Many huts and chairs that were always available. The pool(s) were cool, certainly not tepid as described elsewhere. There were many pool side chairs and several covered cabanas with a queen size bedding. These would tend to get warm by afternoon as there was not as much breeze by the pool. The property does state no reserving places with a towel and everyone does it. This is the RULE OF THE BEACH and is done in every place I've been. People should quit whining about someone getting up early and staking out there spot. If the don't like it, get up earlier. By the way, during our stay, most people were out and about around 9 am.The bars are pretty good and tend to fill up in the evening. The selection is good. With dinner you order a bottle of wine or champagne, not just glasses.Please email us for pictures and answers to questions

<Content>Excellent Honeymoon spot!! My husband and I visited the Paridisus June 15-22, 2003. We had an excellent time. Keep your mind open, relax and have a great time. The only 'non inclusive' activity we took part in was the parasailing excursion. It was a once in a life time experience and worth every penny. There is nothing like sailing in the sky over the Carribean waters looking up and down the shore line while watching sea turtles swim in their natural habitat. We also took advantage of the boogie boards, paddle boats and ocean kayaks on a daily basis. Neither of us got sick. We drank bottled water all week and sampled practically every food and drink item. DON'T FORGET your sunscreen. My husband ran out of sunscreen and paid a ridiculous amount of money. However, you will encounter price inflations on sundries at ANY resort. Have fun.....enjoy the Cubra Libre's ;)

<Content>Just got back from trip on December 13, 2003 Just got back from a great trip from the Paradisus Punta Cana. I want all readers of the posts to realize that some negative reviews are totally unfounded. Sure the room was a little musty upon first entry, but the air conditioner took care of this in quick time. The property was beautiful and especially clean. Rooms were large and very well cleaned and up kept. English was spoken almost by all staff enough to get by and all staff were extremely pleasant and unlike other chains no harrassing sales pitches. The pool was great and the beach was clean and very nice to sit and sun or walk the strip. The restaurants were clean and food was excellent. El Romantico was the only restaurant that I and my wife prefered not to return to, more for the type of food than service or presentation. I would personally recommend anyone to travel to this great resort. Cocotal Golf resort was a good golf course, and enjoyable to play. And for the music, it was not loud at all but a pleasant back ground sound for relaxing and enjoying. The shows were top notch. Go and enjoy, we did.

<Content>Please read I was at the Paridisus in November, 2002. My boyfriend and I spent one of the greatest vacations at the Paridisus! We stayed at an all-inclusive resort in Aruba this past August and we LOVED the Paridisus so much more... Why? - Top shelf liquor -Awesome Pool -Staff WAS AMAZING.. yes, they speak limited English, but it is a Spanish-speaking country. -Food was the best all-inclusive food we ever tasted. ( El-Romantico is the best) -Beach, nightly shows ... Wonderful! The grounds were amazing..... Ok, yes some bugs ( I didn't see any in our room) As a matter of fact, I found a roach in our 4-star resort in Aruba. We are planning to return in April, 2004. We usually travel to Europe, but this is a great getway for relaxing... Everyone told us how great Aruba was, and personally, we would never go back. Paridisus was better and cost less! Give it a shot... no matter where you go, your vacation is what YOU make out of it. Of course there will be some lows, but we didn't have any problems. Actually, the only bug I saw , and it was a small one, came out of one of the flowers the maid left on my pillow. Sweet staff and very appreciative. As far as looking for a tip, who doesn't?

<Content>Paradisus We stayed at the Paradisus from November 16th to November 23rd. It was terrific. However, there are some things that you ought to know.After reading the postings I was scared that I had made a real mistake. We never go on vacations so this was not good to read all of the negative reviews. Fortunately, they are wrong.Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly. The ugly: many people go topless. (Why do the people who have no business being topless, and wear speedos, insist on doing so?). The European visitors there were obnoxious, rude and nasty. On one occasion my wife had the laddle ripped out of her hands by a German Lady who felt she was taking to long making a decision at the buffet table. Talk about the ugly American? The Europeans were awful! The Bad: They (D.R.) hit you up immediately for twenty bucks when you enter the country. One day of rain, some muddy conditions from frequent rainstorms in the evening. Watch out for the Time Share hawkers. We had one guy stalking us. No Nextel service there. Some Europeans at the pool let there kids swim in the nude. (There is a kiddy pool but they refused to use it). Now the Good.  Great plane ride. Food is good. Not great. Good. Solid. The Romantica is overrated, the Japanese place is great. The Italian place is Ok. Steakhouse Ok, Buffet and Seafood place OK. The Cafe on the Beach is beautiful but we experienced terrible service. Plenty of Booze they are not sure what to offer, Pepsi or Coke. The staff is terrific. Fun loving young and enthusiastic. They don't always get it right but they try so hard it is hard to get upset. The Beach is wonderful A plus. We went Horseback riding it was a ball. ATV trip is a must but be warned it is hard work and it is extra. Rooms are a little musty. Water at the beach is warm and the waves are great. I convinced the staff to change the music at the beach from Dominican stuff to Bob Marley. All in all, I would go back again and I am already planning trip for next year. Go. Forget the negative reviews you will enjoy yourself...

<Content>Great Vacation Spot We visited Punta Cana from 11/8-14/2003. It was a beautiful place. We stayed at the The Paradisus, which was great. The food was alittle different at some of the restaurants, but I won't say it was bad. It was just cooked with different oils, etc. The grounds were beautiful and clean.There wasn't much to do in the evenings at the resort. The pool closed at 6 p.m. You could eat dinner from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and the shows began each evening at 10:15 p.m. Other than the casino that opened at 8 p.m., that was it on the evening activities. You were definitely forced to relax, which is what we were looking for.The snorkling was great. Try the Splash excursion. The horseback riding excursion, which I thought was to be through coconut groves was through what I would call a muddy swamp. I would not recommend it.The water was rough and alittle murkey the week we were there. It rained quite abit, but not enough to keep up inside.Our experience overall was great. From our resort, we were able to go to the market by boat, which was a fun adventure in itself. I would recommend The Paradisus, but if we go again, I would like to try the Melia Caribe resort, which is the sister resort to The Paradisus. The Melia is brand new and cheaper as it has not had much adverstising at this point.

<Content>Not 5 star at all! My husband and I stayed at the Paradisus for 5 days and 4 nights. That was plenty. The flight was impeccable... the ride to the resort was more dangerous than anything. Cars weaving in and out...along with dangerous tail-gaiting. We arrived at 12:30p, in our jeans and sweatshirts...sweating (no AC in the lobby) We could not check into our room until 3pm. We got some lunch, which was an awful display of melted cheeses, meats under heat lamps, and discusting looking hot dogs and hamburgers that look like they were sitting out for hours. (this was everyday) My husband and I literally ate rice and rolls for 4 days. The grounds were nothing special...very average. The pool was nice and warm, the ocean beautiful. Dinner we ate at the brazilian, and the steak house...OK but again the salad bars were outside with melted cheese and awful presentation. El Romantico...no biggy..nicely decorated but same food. They had cool dance classes daily at the beach...but repetitive. Nobody spoke english and one guy that worked there asked my husband for 5 bucks!! The shows at night were like talent shows from the local high school.The bottled wate tasted weird..drank my own water only and Pepsi without ice. People did get the runs. Why spend money to sweat, have repetitive food, drink pepsi and have room service with poor looking soggy pizza?? The beerpresidente Great. The only thing my husband drank. I do not recommend going to Punta Cana. Spend your money and travel in the US and hit Vegas or Arizona.

<Content>Great Vacation...10/11-10/19 We returned last night from eight days at Paradisus. It is a beautiful resort and we don't think there is a bad location on the site. The employees were so friendly and helpful (yes, one room was not ready for one hour and our room was not cleaned one day until 5PM....but this did not even begin to hurt our vacation).---The grounds, pool and beach are knockout gorgeous and there was plenty to do. The restaurants all have a different atmosphere and were very good - not five star, but good.  We had a second story room and it was very attractive. Our friends who traveled with us also had a second story room two buildings away. I loved walking around the complex but my husband preferred to take the shuttle (so we took turns). There was construction going on but it interfered with nothing. We had requested ocean view but knew before we went that it would not be available....actually, we preferred the room we got.  We did not do horseback riding (included) or any of the excursions. However, golf was praised by other guests and the Saona excursion will be on our list next time. There were several families there and the children were so good and so well behaved. 98% of the time you were not even aware they were there.  We used room service daily and they were very prompt and accomodating. There is a power boat that goes out at 10 and 1 (about 20 min. along the beach) to a grouping of vendors. The boat captain stayed with us the entire time and it was fun (this, and most excursions, you need to sign up for at the boating area).  We celebrated our anniversary while we were there and emailed the resort this. They made sure we had a dinner reservation at El Romantico on that night and certainly made our stay extra pleasant.----The photographer at the resort goes around taking pictures and then they are for sale at $6/each. Good photographer and some great souvenirs. The Miami Herald newspaper was available each morning at the towel booth.  At the lunch buffet, they had little ice cream cones and 3 types of soft ice cream - we made these every afternoon and they were a great treat. The ONLY time we ran into bugs was one night in the lobby waiting for our friends.....I was bitten (by no seeums) on the ankle....but they left my husband alone. A little Spanish goes a long way.. if you can go knowing 10 words, you will put a smile on the employees faces!  We have also been to Secrets Excellence and, although the food was more top notch, we would tend to return to Paradisus first.  The only criticism I would pass on (and you can work around it) is that the Dominican Music at the pool bar (9:30 a.m to 6:00 p.m. was repetitive and quite loud). All you need to do is locate away from it a little bit and it is fine............One suggestion. The resort does not have pool floats but allows them. Brookstone has a great float that is easy to use and to get in and out of. The center is mesh so you keep cool in the water. They fold up into a circle and into a small carrying bag that will fit in a decent size suitcase (diameter about 24-30).  Before we headed off, the weather forcast was for 7 days of rain beginning with Tropical Storm Mindy....Actuality was 1 1/2 hour of rain one day and rest of the weather was gorgeous and perfect!  To anyone going to Paradisus we say enjoy - we just had a wonderful vacation.....To anyone from Paradisus who reads this we say Muchos, muchos gracias!!!!

<Content>pros and cons...Oct 5-Oct 12 Having travelled to 9 WI islands I had some concept of what to expect. However, this is rated a 5 star property and should be reviewed as they undergo the upgrading of older bungalows and enclosure of restaurants. We were able to summarize that these complaints were from guests in the orginal bungalows constructed. The construction is projected for over the next 11 months and perhaps will equate to a 5 star. After meeting up at the airport again with the people that we flew down we were also able to conclude that all the resorts were running at 90-100% compacity because of the low prices, however, the Paradisus had only 30% capacity so service, chairs etc. was ample. The following are pros and cons... The people are wonderful. Since tourism is still relatively new to the DR, try to be patient as they are all still learning customer service. The Cocatel golf course was great! We played everday and the course could handle a PGA tournament with minor adjustments playing from the golds. This was our favourite!!! The beach is fabulous...definetly, a 5 star! The surf was rough some days but enjoyable! Do not wear any rings or sunglasses into the ocean. The grounds are exotic but vast. The trollies they provide work well for some bungalows but not all so just call and they will gladly pick you up. The rooms certainly differ as we had an older bungalow. Our fans were disconnected because they set off the motion detector which regulated the air conditioning, hence, no movement...no air. The fridges do not work to our expectations so get used to it. We had wood rot on our door frame up to the first hinge on both sides. Obviously prior guests did not secure the liner to the shower marble to alleviate leakage. We had a huge porcelain chunk missing from our tub hence, rust. We had a crack in our toilet seat...ouch. Our white socks were dirty after walking around to unpack, furniture was scratched and the southwestern look is in need of a face lift. There was a huge variety of restaurants offering various cuisines, French, Italian, Spanish, Mexican, Seafood, Chinese, Japanese etc. The French was superb in flavour and presentation and the Italian was always tasty. Unfortunatley, the French never had the shrimp cocktail offered and the Seafood never had the lobster offered. The Hibiscus and Grill buffets are open concept and attrack flies. The food sits around uncovered from start to finish and unfortunately I found maggots in my fruit one morning. Chaffing lids or domed lids would put the responsibility on the guest to control the health factor. Management has offerered a discount on our next vacation to the Paradisus...would we go back? Simply, no.

<Content>Had a great time I went to the Paradisus from Sep 19-24. I would qualify the hotel as a solid 3-4-star hotel: clean rooms, good food, good staff, great property. We ate and drank as much as we wanted, relaxed, smoked cigars and had a overall great time. Yes, at times things were spotty and they are renovating parts of the resort, but this shouldn't overshadow a great experience.Now I've read all the comments and could possible attribute to the following: (i) we went during the low season and the resort was not that crowded; (ii) unrealistic expectations of what constitutes 5-star in the DR; and (iii) possibly the major part of the renovation was over when we went.I would definately recommend this resort, particularly given the low prices.

<Content>Paradisus Punta Cana, what a wonderful vacation!!!!!!!! First of all, we just got back last night from a wonderful week September 13-19, 2003, don't believe everything that you've read in previous posts! After reading some of these recent posts before we left, I almost cancelled and I'm glad that I didn't. I don't know what these people with all of these nit-picking problems have, but maybe they should have stayed at home or at least near their homes. DO NOT LET THEM INFLUENCE your trip!! You have to remember, you are going to a third world country so think of their five star rating as such. Actually, the room could be rated about the same as a Marriott Courtyard suites, maybe a little better. But, overall by the time I left I would have rated everything 10 stars just on how I felt about my stay and experience!!! Every staff member we encountered was nice and made us feel welcome even if they didn't speak English. We learned a few helpful Spanish words and phrases that we found on another website that was very helpful. We tipped the housekeeping staff and wait staff a little each day, but nothing expensive a few dollars each day. We could not tell the difference in service or how we were treated either way, but tipping a little made us feel better because we met the owner of the gift shop (she is an American) and she told us that most of the Dominican people make less than 2,000 US dollars a year and a few dollars can go along way for them. The food was plentiful and very good and a large variety to choose from, if you can't find something you like to eat there then you have to be a very picky eater. We did not have a single meal that wasn't delicious, you can find anything from burgers and fries to fresh grilled whole Lobster. I read a post with a mention of the bottled water. The bottled water is not Spring water, its Mineral Water which does have a few minerals in it and I don't see how you can get sick from it. I drank about 8 bottles a day and was fine. We met a small sized group of fellow Americans from New Jersey and no one got sick that I knew of. As far as the room goes everything was great, we were provided bathrobes to use, there were several towels which are huge!!! The only thing is bring a few washclothes from home with you, they do not have them there. That is the only complaint if that is what you want to call it that I have, but we were prepared. All of the rooms have a slight musty smell to them, but the temps average 80F all the time with about 80% humidity so that is only to be expected. Now, to the most common complaint that I've read is the temp of the drinks in the mini bar. You will not find ice cold drinks anywhere at the resort like we know of them to be here in the States. That is just the way Dominicans are as are most Europeans, they like their drinks cool and refreshing, we as a group like them ice cold and expect it to be that way, but remember you are not at home. As far as the grounds, they are lush and beautiful. There are Coconut Palms and Hybiscus flowers everywhere. The grounds are very well kept and maintaned. Now trying to find something to do huh? Well, you will not find that to be a problem. You can do everything that is listed on their website. We chose to just relax and kick back. We did get a couple of Body Boards and played in the waves for a great time. We also played water polo and volleyball everyday in the late afternoons. Finding a Palapa or a place to sit wasn't a problem at all, you may have to search for 5 minutes, but one could be found if you looked. The shows at night were very good and entertaining and after each show the dancers go in the lobby and they do line dancing Dominican style with the audience. Which I enjoyed watching all the tourists trying to do the Dominican Merengue dances, being from Nashville I was entertained watching all this and got a real good laugh at it. I cannot think of a single bad experience that would cause me not to return. You must go with an open mind and remember that you are in their country not in your own, they are more laid-back than we are here, so they do not provide services as quick or in a hurry as we do here in the States. I can see how many people could complain about slower service than they are used to so if your wanting to have someone at your beck and call or have people run around like chickens with their heads cut-off because you requested something then the DR is not for you stay at home because your going to be disspointed. Also, mid-August thru Febuary is their off-season so some construction is to be expected, they have to maintain the place and rennovate it sometime and its kind of hard to do when the place if filled to capacity. Having to step aside a few times to let a worker get by you with building supplies did not affect our vacation at all it only 2-3 times the whole week, it sure did beat having to be at work. We only heard saws a handful of times and they are installing several roofs but all the roofs are Palapa roofs, which are only made out of Coconut Palm leaves and make no noise when being installed. Remember go with an open mind and look forward to meeting the Dominican People, they want to share their country and their lifestyle with you, it truly is almost heaven on earth. I wish I was going back now!!!! If anyone has any questions or comments feel free to email me at AHannityClone@aol.com.Andrew W. Nashville,TN September 13-19,2003

<Content>A Mediocre Vacation Let me begin this review by saying that for the most part what I read about the Paradisus was true...the good, the bad and the ugly.My family (my husband, myself and our 5 year old daughter) vacationed at the Paradisus for a week in August 2003. We enjoy vacationing in the Caribbean and have travelled to: St. John; Tortola, Cayman Islands, Aruba, St. Thomas, Cancun, Puerto Rico, Turks  Caicos, Paradise Island, and Anquilla (by the way, in my opinion, a honeymooners Paradise, not much to do there, but lots of RR and EXCELLENT food).What follows is our experience during our week's stay:CHECK IN: Very smooth. We arrived at the hotel at around 11:00 AM and our room was ready in 1/2 hour. We were quickly shuttled to our room and the vacation began.POOL: Very large and wonderfully landscaped. However, I must agree with many of the other reviews..the pool, at times, was littered with straws and plastic cups. Even though I did see workers sweeping around the pool, I did not see any one checking the water. I am not saying that it did not happen. I am just saying that during my 5 hour days at the pool; not once did I see the water tested. this concerned me a little especially since the water was extremely warm.GROUNDS: Lush vegitation and tropical. Lots of different plants, trees and flowers.ROOMS: True to what many reviews have said our room had musty smell...sometimes very typical in the Caribbean, but more so at this resort. I took the suggestion of one person and travelled with scented candles and plug-ins. Our room didn't have a dresser to store clothes, but did have shelves in the closet. Sometimes there was a shortage of washclothes. Contrary to some of the reviews our A/C worked well; in fact we called for an extra blanket and our request was fulfilled quickly.BEACH: Very large and quite crowded. The sand itself was very soft...the water was a little rough (reminded us of Cancun) and there was an abundant amount of seaweed. Topless bathers, both young and old.KIDS CAMP: Almost non-existent. The kids club was a non-airconditioned hut with a very old two swing playset in front. Not many children in the camp, and those who were there during our week's stay did not speak english. Needless to say, we didn't use that free amenity. We were accustomed to the Kids Kamp at Beaches and were quite disappointed. So parents be awareFOOD: Not too much to talk about...wasn't that impressed. Some days Hybiscus had a much better selection than others. my food does not have to be fancy just tasty. If I had to pick a favorite it would be the steakhouse...good peas and rice, decent steak and fresh sauteed veggies. As an after thought, we went to El Romantico and I ordered the shrimp cocktail. well, the shrimp were small and tossed in, what I believe Thousand Islands Dressing, not really what I expected.NIGHTLY ENTERTAINMENT: the best we've seen in all of our travels less Aruba...very entertaining. since there is a language barrier, the entertainment mostly consisted of dancing and lip syncing to music. On Sunday night, there were flamingo dancers which were extremely enjoyable to watch.SHUTTLE: Can become very crowded...however our daughter enjoyed catching the Tram as she called it.Would we go back.to Paradisus..No. Would we go back to the Dominican Repulic...maybe. There are other destinations for us to explore and try.Hope this helps.

<Content>You Just Can't Please Everyone ! My wife, myself and another couple were at Paradisus Aug 9-16, 2003, and had agreat time with very few minor complaints. Before going we read all the reviews on this page and others for a couple of months and were a little hesitant about our choice but it was to late to make any change, so off we went. I don't understand how some of the postings on this site were from the exact same time that I was there and yet we seem to have been at completely different resorts. I think some people have to really learn how to travel in the Caribbean, youve got to relax, repeat, relax. You are not in a major city staying in the Four Seasons, you are in Paradise in another country, with different culture, language, priorities etc., but enough of my philosophy. Paradisus is one of the most beautiful resorts I've been to, nice beach with moderate waves (I don't know where the people who call this water rough have been swimming, but I don't think its been in the Atlantic Ocean). Public areas of the resort are large, clean and well maintained. The food is good overall with some of the restaurants (Romantica, Seafood Grill) being very good. Again, youve got to remember this isn't home, you're on vacation, don't stress out over minor stuff, focus on the good. Our room was in a great location (Bldg 20) near the beach and most of the eating spots. We had plenty of towels and water etc. and the room was clean and taken care of every day. Yes, some days a little later then others, but so what, I'm not here to sit in my room. I will admit that as with other comments here I was a little annoyed by the whole reserve a chair with a towel crap going on, but that is the fault of some rude and inconsiderate people staying here, not the resort, and we always found a place to sit anyway. I don't want to ramble on endlessly so I will just sum it up with the advice that you take all the really negative reports here with a large grain of salt, this a a great place to vacation and some of these people would probably not be able to have a good time no matter where they went. If you have any specific questions about our experience please feel free to contact me at my e-mail address, I would be happy to hear from any prospective visitors.

<Content>"PLEASE READ!!!!!" I have stayed at the EL CONQUISTADOR,FIESTA AMERICANA CANCUN, WESTIN RESORT PUERTO RICO, EL SAN JUAN P.R. THIS HOTEL IS IN THE SAME CATEGORY. What it lacks is a more organized system. Food is a 10,Liquor a 10,grounds a 10, service 10, beach 10,pool a 10 plenty a kiddie pools tied into the main pool so parents can enjoy the drinks and music and their kids all at once!!What it need is some updating which they already began. Dollar for dollar best vacation!!They also supply cigarettes and cigars free. Oh spa is also very nice.

<Content>Pick Another If you like co-habiting with lots of ants, mildew smelling curtains, broken down beds and a bathroom that leaks - You will love Paradisus! Did I mention that I was terribly sick for 2 days after my arrival. I couldn't leave my room. I would say it had to be the food (Y U C K) or water. Our transfer from the airport was a stifling hot bus with no air conditioning or windows that could be opened I almost passed out along with my husband, children and friends! Our supposedly called Jr. Suite room turned out to be an old room that was small, cramped, had no closet (only enough to fit a few things), space and ants that were plentiful. The food left much to be desired. I couldn't wait to get back home. I must make a good point about the resort- the staff is very friendly and accomodating I only wish they spoke some english (luckily my husband speaks spanish well). The beach was beautiful, but there was alot of seaweed and it was a bit rough for my children. Would I come again to Paradisus - Definately Not!

<Content>Great vacation We went to the Dominican Republic for the Christmas holiday last year (2002) and on the advice of our travel chose the Paradisus. We had a GREAT time! You must keep in mind a 5 star property in Dominican Republic is different than a 5 star property in New York or Paris, but so is the price! My highest praise is that we have rebooked our vacation and will be on the beach to watch Santa Claus arrive by boat!

<Content>Paradisus was a HUGE disappointment We've just returned from the Paradisus and feel the resort was totally misrepresented. We have traveled extensively all over the Carribean, and this was far from a Luxury resort.I will start with our check-in which was smooth. However, when we were dropped off at the room, it was already occupied. We sat there for 10 minutes while the bellman/shuttle driver called back up to the lobby (another family was waiting on the shuttle). Finally, he took us to another room and the maid had to let us in. He said someone would be right behind us with new keys. After 5 calls to the front desk and over an hour of being stranded in our new room, we had new keys. On one call, they had the nerve to ask us to call back in 5 minutes because they were busy checking people in. The rooms are not bad, but not exactly what I would consider 5-star luxury.Finally, we head out to explore the resort. The pool area is beautiful and the foliage thruout the resort is very well maintained. The ocean is breathtaking and the beach is clean. That's about it for the positives.The entire resort is under renovation which means electric saws, drills, workers everywhere. You could not even hear the music in the bar for the construction. There were men busting out sidewalks, installing new roofs, painting, etc. You constantly had to stand to the side to let a worker with a wheelbarrow or load of palm fronds get by. And it was no different on the beach. They were building a new cabana on the beach complete with electric saws again so we moved down away from those sounds. Only to be greeted by the scent of fresh paint as they touched up the massage cabana on the beach. And if you want a chair, make sure you break the rules and leave towels on it 24/7. There are signs everywhere that you can't save chairs unless someone is there, but it is not enforced.Restaurants and service in general were fair. Make sure you ask for reservations before you get there --- I emailed the hotel directly and had reservations waiting when we arrived. The only restaurant where we had a great meal and service was El Romantico. The Japanese was a joke -- we had an 8pm reservation, got seated at 8:50 and didn't get a drink until 9:10. Everything else was so-so, including the buffet which was basically the same everyday. But the people in the restaurants generally don't understand service. The service in the bars is much better.Regarding the included excursions, two words -- GOOD LUCK. Everything was booked up when we arrived. They only take 30 people horseback riding per day (15 each twice per day) and it is only 3 days of the week. Same with scuba, snorkel, shopping, etc. When the shopping excursion was full, the resort offered to have a boat take me there and wait to bring me back for a fee of $40. We opted to go on our own after we learned it is a 10 minute walk from the resort. You can get there by walking on the beach or out of the front lobby.Needless to say, I would not recommend this resort to anyone. Perhaps when all the renovations are complete, this resort will live up to it's name. It has a loooong way to go.

<Content>August vacation at Paradisus Warning! Before going to Punta Cana, I read many reviews with regard to the Paradisus; some good and some bad, and since my travel agent recommended me the Paradisus as one of the best resorts in Punta Cana, my wife and I (31 and 30) went there to spend a full week.Ill try to be brief: Im from Spain, and let me tell you Im ashamed that a Spanish Resort can allow such poor quality on food, organization, room quality and a very poor level of cleanness. Our room was dirty (dirty sheets, dirty floor, dirty bathroom with no towels) we claimed for towels all week long and Im still waiting. We used the beach towels in order to take a shower (disgusting). The room was very old and full of bugs; the only thing that worked (barely) was the A/C. Food: same food every day and used the same food from the day before (I can assure this information since I spoke with one of the cooks). Very low quality, over cooked in some cases. Pool: nice but as soon as you get close to the Pool Bar you just want to head back. People drunk at the bar, full of kids drinking alcohol and pouring the drinks into the pool. Shouting, yelling, well, not too nice to have a relaxing drink at the pool. Beach: very nice but Ok water. The water is a bit rough so dont expect the crystal clear water from other Caribbean locations or Pacific locations. For that, go to La Romana. DO wake up early and reserve some hammocks by leaving your books or magazines, or you will have to lay down on the sand. People: may seem friendly but at the end they will be really annoying. They just want to be friendly so that they can earn a $, not because they want to help. Remember that.Overall: definitely a non 5 star hotel, 3 star max. Great grounds, good beach, that is it. There are plenty of better places in the Caribbean. If you expect nice ocean water, great rooms, great service, friendly people, decent food a relaxing place to spend your vacation time, this IS NOT THE PLACE.

<Content>Please Read This!!!!! I just got back from there, and would never never return. I have been to Mexico, Bermuda, Aruba, St. Lucia, and many parts of Florida, and this was by far the worst vacation we had.It was my wife's birthday, and picked this place because we were told by a travel agent it was the best place to stay.We brushed up on some Spanish because we were told it was a good idea. First off we arrived, and the airport, is very disorganized, we overheard a couple say Paradisus so we followed them through a maze of buses to find ours, hopped on and waited for 20 minutes before we could leave. Don't understand why because when we left the bus driver was sitting the entire time and noone else entered the bus.We arrived at the resort, it looks nice but noone to great us or direct us to the desk checkin. We find it and I ask for an ocean view seeing it was my wife's birthday that week. They said no ocean views as they were renovating.(That's an understatement). Their was construction going on in the beach lobby, the beach front and digging up walkways and grass to fix A/C.They have pictures of the renovated rooms. We certainly did not get one. Our room had bugs, alot of bugs. We could not enjoy the lobby bar yet, or have a drink because our mini bar did not have any drinks, and we had to wait for our luggage in the room.I called about the bugs and they said they would fumigate(awesome). When the luggage arrived 20 minutes later we waited for the maintenance to resolve the bug problem, 2 hours later they came by and dropped off a can of spray. Also we had a missing mirror in the main room to be used to get ready, it never was replaced.I called to get some beer for the mini bar.We headed down to get some pizza, eat and go back to the room to get ready for the evening. Since our afternoon was wasted. When we return the A/C was not working. So we called and they said half the resort had no A/C(great)Still No beer in the mini bar.They dug a hole in the ground to fix the A/C and they broke something else. Now more bugs as the room got hotter.Went to the lobby bar full of kids and rude Europeans.Went back to room Slept with fan on and woke to A/C working.Kids all over the restaurant, running around, no discipline by the parents.Headed to the beach next morning No beach chairs avail, under shade, clearly stated no reserving chairs with towels, you must have one guest present to hold and beach chair. Noone seems to abide by this rule.Went to the pool and found 2 chairs off to one side, no breeze at all. Went in the pool bar, more rude Europeans and their misbehaving kids, splashing in your drinks and Underage drinking at the bar.All Bottled water and bottled Pepsi was warm. Bottled Water actually had 6 ingredients in it, Water should be just water!!!! Right.Stuck to the Bottled Beer, instead.Went back to the room and the A/C was broken again. We left a tip for the Main thinking maybe Beer. Still no beer in mini barWent to the small fitness center and A/C broken their too. Could get much of a workout if you start sweating when you enter the building.Called about the A/C and went to Dinner at the Japanese restaurant, no A/C there. Got back to room and requested we be moved to another room.Really enjoying our vacation now, my wife is in tears.This room has A/C, but only if you turn all the lights off, you can either have lights or A/C but not both. This room mini bar is broken and drinks are warm.I call about the mini bar and someone shows up with light bulbs(that helps me how)?I call our rep at the lobby to explain our issues, she was very nice, but the only thing that happened was someone showed up to our room with 4 beers I had to suck down, because our mini bar was not working.Now after about 4 days of this, the bottled water, gave my wife and I diarrhea. I know this because we stayed clear of the salad and fruit, and used bottled water to even brush our teeth.Nothing was done to rectify our horrible experience, and I would never return to that country.They are in need of a serious Utility Infrastructure Overhaul.

<Content>What a wonderful vacation My husband's brothers and wives and I a total of 6 adults went to Punta Cana the last week of June. We were originally booked at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. We had read many reviews like everyone else and our worst nightmare took place. We had fears of being bumped to the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Resort. I had mentioned this to our travel agent and she called Vacation Express and we were assured that would not happen. If we were bumped we would be upgraded.On Thursday before we left on Friday I got a call from our travel agent, she said our worst fear had happened. She received a call the previous Monday and was informed we had been bumped and we were to move to the Bavaro Garden's. She told them that was not expectable for us. Apparently our travel agent worked with Vacation Express all week trying to work this out. Alison from Commonwealth Travel told them they either had to refund our money and rebook the trip or we were to be upgraded. I am just so thankful this happened before we left and not when we got there. I am also thankful all of our reservations were under one reversion number so we were not going to be split up. To make a long story short we were upgraded to the Paradisus at no extra charge to us. We were thrilled.You need to remember you are not in the United States, have an open mind, smile and have a great time. The Dominican's are thrilled to have us there and want to see the US dollars.The Paradisus was wonderful! We had little to no complaints. The food was good and a wonderful variety. You don't have to worry about the fruits and vegetable they wash them with filtered water. Not one of us got sick. It was also nice before we left for the airport they fixed us box lunches to take with us since we were going to be at the airport for a while. It was a couple of sandwiches, fruit and water. It was a nice little extra all you had to do was ask.The beach and the pool was wonderful also. No problem getting a lounger anytime of the day. We did not find the language to be a problem. Most people that dealt with the public spoke English. The maids and other employees may not speak much, but you can communicate with them.We could not tell a difference in service if we tipped or not. We didn't have a problem tipping them for service to help them out, but I don't think yo have to feel it is totally necessary.You have to take a boat to the flea market. The boat ride is worth the trip. The girls went one day while the guys played golf. Then we had to take the guys another day. The boats to do dock they land. It was fun.Our biggest frustration was trying to communicate with family in the US. We had a problem with the phone card we took with us saying our access number was not valid. I did make a call on my credit card just to touch basis. I know my call wasn't more than 2-3 minutes. When I got home and got the bill it was almost $50.00. Do not make that mistake. We were told our cell phones should work, but they didn't. Finally the only way we came up with to communicate was by Internet. You can purchase an Internet card, which I did. The first time I tried to use it, the computer locked up and they had to get an engineer to work on it as my minutes were ticking away. They fixed that, but it wasn't until the next day. It all worked out, but it was frustrating since we had told family we would contact them and then not able to do so.Everyone was very helpful. Watch out when you arrive for the timeshare people. They didn't bother us, they were friendly, but just be aware and don't get hooked.We had a great time and will definitely go back to the Paradisus. We had an awesome time and tell all our friends where to go on a great vacation. We loved the all inclusive package and will definitely vacation that way again.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation!!! My boyfriend and I just returned from the Paradisus, and I cannot say enough wonderful things about this resort! I was somewhat worried before we left the states because of some of the reviews that I had read, but I am happy to report that my worries were groundless. The food was wonderful, the service was efficient and all the employees were extremely friendly and accommodating. (I recommend that you leave a couple of dollars tip each day, just as you would in any hotel. Many of these workers depend on the generosity of the people who visit, and are extremely grateful for any contribution to their livelyhood. ) Our room was spotless everyday, and if we needed anything, it was provided for us. I find it interesting that others have had such a bad experience...I even talked to one lady that was leaving the day before I was and she complained about how horrible the food was, and how lousy the service was. It's hard to believe that she was in the same resort that I was. I guess sometimes people leave home and look for things to complain about. All I can say is that my boyfriend and I completely agree that this was one of the best vacations that we have ever had, and were are planning on returning again!!

<Content>Relaxation At Last I want to first tell each and every one of you that you should never believe everything you read. After reading all the negative comments about the heat, service, food, drinks, and distance from one spot to another within the resort............I was almost ready not to GO. BUT THANK GODNESS I DIDN'T LISTEN. First, let's talk about the bad aspects of the trip. Here they are: 1. english is not the official language of the island. 2. lobster ran out one night. 3. hotel market was closed for three days due to new management.......and that's about it. As far as the food, air conditioning, pool, service and amenities go....it's top of the line. Seriously, we've stayed at several all-inclusive places and this is bye far one of the best we've stayed. But remember people, it's what you make of it. If you don't like 85 degree weather all day long....don't go. If you don't like different food from different cultures.......don't go. And if you don't like to belly up a one of the best pool bars in the world, get a tan, dance with your lady or gamble all night long.......please, don't go. And never mind your bad review either. Go visit the Paradisus. YOU WILL LOVE IT.

<Content>10 year anniversary good and not so good We just returned from the Paradisus on August 3 from a 7 night stay. We were there for our 10 year annivesary so our travel agent booked us in a resort that supposedly didn't have many children. Wrong there were children everywhere, all ages. Was not happy about that. Grounds and the pool were awesome, food was quite good for an all-inclusive. My husband and I did experience some stomach distress towards the end of vacation but we can't figure out why, our representative said everyone that week was complaining from all hotels about stomach issues. Couple of other problems we experienced, our air conditioning broke twice, once for the whole day (as did half of the resort), so finally after enough complaining they moved our room which took more time from our vacation. On our arrival we did find some little bugs in our bathroom which they sprayed, after waiting 2 hours, and took care of the problem. Beach is beautiful and people who work there are very friendly. If you are looking for a place that is somewhat high end with no children this in not the place, if you want to bring your kids and have good food and a great beach book away!

<Content>Paradisus was wondeful We visited the Paradisus February 22 - 27, 2003 and had a great time. The initial check in was really nerve-racking. We traveled with 2 other couples and one single person and none of our rooms were close together. They had us spread all over the resort. We had to try 3 different times to get in a room. Everytime we went to a room and opened the door someone else was in the room already. Finally after the third trip back to front desk and after dark (7:30 pm) we finally got into a room. That was the only really bad thing we experienced. The food was good, alot better than I have eaten at some of the all-inclusives in Mexico. The entertainment was good. The resort was absolutely gorgeous and the beach was one of the prettiest and most relaxing I have ever been on. I think that the Brazilian resturant was probably my favorite. The pool is great, in meanders around the resort and you just walk right into it like a lagoon.The one thing that still stick out in my mind was how friendly and helpful all the staff was. I had forgotten to take with me a prescription drug that I take for heart arrythmia. I did however have a written prescription with me that I had not had to get refilled yet. I went to guest relations to find out what I could do. I was a little nervous because I was in a foreign country. They informed me that there was a pharmacy in town and that they would fill it for me. We went to have someone to call us a taxi into to town and asked them about where the pharmacy was and the gentleman offered to go into town and pick up the prescription for me. He paid for it out of his own pocket and then I reimbursed him when he got back. The good thing was that in the U.S.A. that prescription would have cost me over $100.00, but in D.R. it only cost me $20.00. It was factory sealed so I did not worry about anything then. We would go back to Paradisus Punta Cana anytime.

<Content>Fantastic honeymoon My husband and I spent our honeymoon at the Paradisus May 12-24. I have traveled to many all-inclusives in the Caribbean and this one is top-rate. It truely is all-inclusive (drinks, food, sports, golf) and all top shelf. We had a fantastic time there - impeccable service, our room was ready when we got there (we even had the specific room we requested beforehand), and they treated us so well. Our room was clean, smelled fine and the grounds were more than what we had expected.While the food wasn't out-of-this-world-gourmet, it was definitely very good and plentiful. Our favorite restaurants were the Brazilian, Mexican, El Romantico and the Steak Place. But there were so many choices (and we were there in an off-time so not every place was open every night) it would be hard to find something you didn't like. We never once got sick (do not drink or brush teeth with tap water - we didn't and were fine). And we tried just about everyting. Sure some things weren't great, but if I didn't like it I'd either get something else or not get it the next time. Although, I have to tell you there were several times I got things a second time just because they were so good!Drinks are great - they know how to make them and are not afraid to add the liquor. Socrates knows how to make an excellent mojito!The beach is beautiful and so is the pool. The best I have seen anywhere. The whole place is very clean and well-groomed.Also, I highly recommend playing golf and the Outback Jungle Safari is a MUST! If you don't do anything else while you are there - do the jungle safari. It made our trip very memorable.For those of you who read negative reviews and are afraid - DO NOT BE. Trust me, there were times I wanted to cry when I read reviews prior to going, but eveything turned out GREAT! There is no language barrier if all you speak is english. All restaurant and bar staff speak english. The resort is clean and safe. You have to remember - you are not in the US so things will be a little different and sometimes slower, but go with the flow. You are on vacation! I would rate this as a very high value, as we got to stay twice as long in the DR rather than one week in St. Lucia for the same kind of trip. If you are honeymooners - they treat you well and make you feel special - which was important to us. It was a fantastic trip!If you have any questions, please ask!

<Content>Awesome honeymoon I stayed at the Paradisus from April 28-May 5. It was a great trip. Everything I read in these reviews before was true: both good and bad. But the good FAR outweighs the bad. The pool is the most beautiful and relaxing I've ever seen. So nice that we only went to the beach twice. Photographers walk around with monkeys and parrots and put them on your head and take pictures. You can go pick them out and buy them by the Hybiscus grill. They're pretty cheap, like $6. The sun is hot but never over 85 degrees, and there's always a slight breeze. The humidity was nothing compared to Kentucky summers. It felt very mild in Punta Cana in comparison. It never rained a single drop, even though thunderstorms were in the forecast for the entire week. We hardly had any clouds. Oh yeah, there are free pina coladas and Paradisus' anywhere you go, as well as whatever mixed drink you want. You might have to tell them how to make it, but they'll do it. We played beach volleyball, water polo, water basketball, sailed a catamaran (which is a lot more fun than I ever imagined, they let us take it out by ourselves, just watch out for coral reefs), did water aerobics, archery, and were even invited to play in a basketball game with natives on Friday night. It was like a traveling exhibition team and we played on the court at the front of the resort by the tennis courts. Fair warning, if you participate in something like this, you play by their rules in their country. But it was a lot of fun, and I got a free T-shirt. I personally thought the food was excellent everywhere, but I'm not a picky eater at all, and I have no expectations. I was especially impressed with the Japanese Restaurant. They served fried ice cream at most restaurants, which was ice cream covered in kahlua (i think) and set on fire. Pretty cool. The Brazilian restaurant was also excellent and was air conditined. Italian was also good and we always sat on the water. We would throw little pieces of bread to the fish. An older couple saw us doing it, tried it, and got a pretty big thrill out of it. My wife and I shared everything we ate, and she was sick the entire week, and I never felt a thing. However, she was never sick enough to not have fun. Just a quick trip to the restroom every now and then. Every couple we met there had one person out of the two who got sick every day. Strange. The pool bar tenders were awesome. Definitely visit them every day. The rooms were nice. We did find a roach in the first room and asked to go to another room. Found one there too, but didn't care any more. I took care of both of them pretty easily so I wasn't scared any more. Some people told me they're not actually roaches but water beetles, and I think they come in during housekeeping, because they leave the doors wide open. Both of our rooms were on the second floor. Hint: leave a dollar in the mini-fridge and they will restock it with beer instead of sodas. Leave a dollar for housekeeping and they will leave you a treat (honey-soap, figurine, and a couple more things we got). Don't tip more than a dollar ever, it's unnecessary. I think we tipped $20 for the week total, and had excellent service. The beach isn't as rough as people make it out to be. There are coral reefs far out, so the waves aren't bad. They're a lot rougher at Daytona, FL and Paradise Island Bahamas. It was just right for playing in. Walk north down the beach (left) and go towards a shipwreck. You'll see it after about 10 minutes. A few minutes later you'll come to a huge market. There's a smaller one on the way, but keep going and you'll come to the big one. It's awesome. The best souvenirs in the Caribbean. Dominicans are very talented. Lots of oil paintings, hand-carved stone statues, hand-carved chess sets, wall carvings, decorated knives and machetes, as well as clothing. This stuff was well-made, much better than the junk at Nassau's straw market. Never offer more than half price and never change your bid. Start to walk away, and they'll come right down. It's worth the 15 minute walk if you want souvenirs. You'll notice during the walk that the Paradisus has the only clean beach because they rake up the seaweed every morning :) You'll also notice that every beach is topless. We saw a midget in a thong. The nightly shows were pretty good. We actually found them very entertaining. The casino was pretty small, but there was always a spot open to play. It sounds like we were pretty active, but it only amounted to a couple of hours a day. The rest of the time was in or by the pool or eating. Can't say enough about the pool. So clean never even saw any leaves or anything in it. There is a smell at the resort as you go to the lobby from the rooms. The map says there are ponds there, but it is tree-filled swamps you pass through. It kinda smells like sewage, but I think it is more of the wet swamp smell. If you've ever been in the woods in a swampy area you know what I mean. Anyway, you only get a quick whiff if you decide to go to the lobby. It's not even worth mentioning, but other people have mentioned it in their reviews. Nothing to worry about. Just drink a Paradisus and forget about it. The walk from the rooms to the lobby isn't that far, either. I think the distance has been exaggerated. Anyone can do it in 10 minutes or so if you don't feel like waiting to be shuttled. It's only about a 100 yards or so, maybe 200. Just don't be so lazy. Have another Paradisus and don't worry about it. Oh yeah, the language barrier doesn't exist, either. 3 words: hola (hello), gracias (thanks), por favor (please, i think) and give a universal smile. Those simple manngers are all you need to communicate. Unless you're picky to one extreme or the other, this place really was paradise (except for the roaches/beetles, hence the 4/5 stars). The only way you won't enjoy this place is if you're determined not to.

<Content>Worst vacation ever taken My husband and I stayed at the Paradisus May 6-13, 2003. Upon arrival, we were very impressed with the grounds, decor, etc. Upon checking in (around 1pm) we were told our room would be ready in 45 mins. We went to have lunch and when we returned almost an hr and half later our room was still not ready. We actually did not have a clean room until 4:30pm the day we arrived. The pool was very nice and the room although decor was nice smelled very damp and musty. On our 2nd day there my husband became extremely ill (stomach pains, etc.) and remained ill for the entire 7 days we were there. The food was horrible. Nothing you ate tasted the way it looked. The meat was very gamey (my husband is convinced he ate horsemeat). Many of the restaurants are outdoors where I have witnessed cockroaches crawling on the food. Many times we were given dirty silverware, glasses, etc. They never changed their table linens or our sheets on our bed. We met some very nice people during this trip, which did make the best of a bad situation, but it is extremely disapointing to pay $3000. for an all-inclusive when you can't eat or drink. It is strongly recommended that you speak some Spanish, b/c no one there speaks English and the language barrier definately is an issue. I highly recommend you do your research before considering this resort. We will never visit here again.

<Content>Very Nice Just returned from this resort with my wife and 12  13 year old sons. We have traveled pretty extensively in Hawaii and the Caribbean. The resort itself is extremely nice. The grounds are beautifully maintained. Absolutely gorgeous! There also seemed to be enough to keep our boys well entertained the whole trip. It is a huge place but the resort operates a bunch of little tram-like vehicles which run everywhere around the resort so you don't have to walk yourself to death. The food was just O.K. in my opinion, like most all-inclusives. Very nice beach area, clean and roomy. Service was prompt and attentive in every experience we had. The swimming pool was great. So huge that it never seemed crowded. Only the swim-up bar got crowded. Imagine that! A note and $2.00 tip to the maid got me a six-pack of beer and a case of bottled water in my room every time I requested it. It is amazing how far a little tipping will get you there. Rooms were extremely nice and roomy. Also tastefully furnished. My only disappointment was the scuba diving. Being an avid diver I like to dive every chance I get. Large waves and swells, small multi-pupose boats without ladders, and bland reefs void of much interesting marine life made for a pretty lackluster diving experience. The dive staff was good though and went out of their way to try and make everything as enjoyable as possible with they had to offer. It would provide a very romantic location for a couple for sure. Be prepared to sweat though. In June it was hot! Like most resorts there, it is open-air and pretty humid. I guess that's also to be expected in most of the caribbean during the summer months. Overall, I would speak very highly of this resort if you aren't a die-hard snorkeling or diving fanatic.

<Content>Nothing to complain about My husband and in-laws and I just returned from a week at Paridisus Punta Cana and had a lovely time. The grounds are just beautiful and lush. The beach and pool were wonderful. (We spent much of our time at the lovely pool.) The resort is on the Atlantic, rather than the Caribbean, so the water at the beach can be rough.)We were anticipating some difficulties at this resort a la other folks' reviews, but were pleasantly surprised. The food was tasty (albeit not gourmet in most of the restuarants). We would recommend the Brazilian and Mexican restaurants. The service was good and the staff were friendly. With a little Spanish, your requests will be honored without hesitation. In many cases, non-English speaking staff would ellicit the help of English speaking staff rather than trying to muddle through the language barrier. We were there very off season so the staff to guest ratio was high. I could see how the staff coordination could be more challenging with an increased number of guests. We took the trip to Manati Park to swim with the dolphins. For us it was worth the $70 price tag (incl. park . The park is small and interesting, but not worth the $25 admission fee on its own. Vendors are lined up at the park to sell you this or that throughout. None of the rooms were beach front, but most were adequate and had nice garden/pond views. (We stayed in building 12.) The rooms closest to the beach were the lowest and highest building numbers. Our room was pleasant, cool and clean. We pushed our two full sized beds together. Each room has a small living room area and patio. (It's helpful to remember that this is not the Ritz Carlton, but a lovely, relaxing caribbean-type garden apartment-type setting. I would eagerly return to Paridisus and I would return with children and family. Be prepared to relax and take it easy and you will enjoy your stay there greatly.

<Content>I had a nice time! I stayed at the Paridisus June of 2001 for my Honeymoon. It was my first time vacationing in the Caribean so I did not have much room for comparison. Getting to the Dominican was kind of hectic considering we did a connecting flight. I must admit the smaller plane was bumpy..not to mention SMALL. We had no problems departing and leaving the airport--the ride to the resort was also a good experience. Our host was very entertaining. I was not very impressed with the ambiance outside of the resort. Approaching the resort brought some comfort to me. The entrance and lobby are very pretty. Warning: the check in line is LONG. But, you are greeted with a nice tropical drink called the PARIDISUS. And, yes...the lobby is far from the rooms. If your lazy like I was, you will have to wait for the trolly. Although, the size of the resort might not sound pleasant, it really is not that bad. The resort is very pretty. There is only one pool....and in my opinion it was very nice and not to mention very big. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the food and the fact that the water was not drinkable if it wasn't bottled. They tried they're best in serving us bottled water but I was afraid of the thought that the same tap water was used to make our food and other beverages. I thought that the nightly entertainment was fun. My husband participated in all the activities. I would definately recommend this resort around mid June. I heard some not so good things about other months but June was definately good for us. I hope you guys experience a good time as I did. Lumi.

<Content>Not what I expected I recently stayed at the Paradisus Punta cana May 14, the property itself is very big it took me about a 30min walk from my room to the lobby, their little cars that take you to the lobby but they take forever, and they sometimes never stop, even though they see you, this is my second time going to punta Cana and the drinks their are horrible, they are not good at all during the time I went the Paradisus was almost empty, not a lot of people where stayin their, the beach was empty, not many people as well as the pool which was kind of nice, their are about 8 a la carte restaurants their, that require reservations but since their were not many people staying at the hotel no reservations where required, the buffet was close and only open for lunch and breakfast not dinner needless to say the food sucked,the breakfast at the buffet was not good, the luch was just o.k for dinner I went to the Italian resturants, and it was very bad, the MExican was the best one, I did not go to el Romantico but i heard the food was good their, the staff was friendly sometimes, other days not so much overall this hotel was nice but I expected better, hopefully this review helped hope your stay in Punta is lots of fun, It's a great destination

<Content>A Fabulous Vacation My husband and I just returned from our wonderful honeymoon vacation in the Dominican Republic. The Paradisus was an excellent resort, and one I would highly recommend to other travelers. Our room was clean and spacious and had a beautiful view of the ocean. The food at the resort was not gourmet cuisine, but was perfectly fine and from what other vacationers said about the food at the other resorts, i.e. The Barcelo Complex, ours was much better. We made our reservations early for the Japanese and French restaurants and did not have any trouble getting seating. The food at those two restaurants were particularly good. The Caribbean Grill was also had pretty good food. Most of the employees spoke at least some English, and many were fluent in 2 or more languages. They did seem to appreciate that we at least attempted to speak Spanish and were very understanding of broken sentences, etc. Those who said negative things about this resort must not know how to relax and have a good time. The Dominicans, for the most part, did not seem to be in a rush or hurry, but our every request was honored. It may take a minute or 2 for the bartender to take your order, but it is obvious he/she is working at a steady pace. We enjoyed the scuba diving (I was not certified and took the free lesson) and were invited to go as many times during our stay as we liked. Everything is included at this resort from the Scuba lessons and diving to taking out the Catamarans and snorkeling along with extensive options for food and beverage. I can't say enough wondeful things about the Paradisus, the staff, the accomodations, the amenities... it was all wonderful.If you've stayed at the Moon Palace in Cancun, the Paradisus is comparable.

<Content>Wow! What a great place !! I just returned from Paradisus, Punta Cana last night.. Before the trip I was very upset with the negative reviews I had read, as there were 14 of us- (all 40 ish in age) going on this trip.. I was pleasantly surprised at everything... It was a fabulous vacation with the worst part of it being that it was difficult to get the butter packets opened.. Did I see some cats? Yes.. They weren't a bother at all.. Did we see a cockroach? Yes. Not in my first floor room, but in a friends room  he killed it.. Most of us were in bldg 27.. It was a great location  I would recommend it to anyone.. It's in the middle of the beach  restaurant  pool areas.. Just a short walk to all.. The room service was great.. All you have to do there is be friendly and try to communicate through the language barrier  they bend over backwards to accomodate you...We never had problems getting chairs for the beach or the pool, actually had the chairs next to the swim up bar every day...The 2 bartenders at the pool bar were the BEST, and if you go  you see Lenin George (he goes by Lenny) or Ramon- just 2 young guys- you have to tell them you read this review from their Philadelphia friends who gave them the Phillies hat  shirt-- They definitely will remember us.. A word of advice. Take plenty of $ 1.00 bills,  5's. They dont like to make change, especially in town  it's great advice that if you tip well you get taken care of by everyone.. We went on the maranarium snorkeling thing through apple  it was a great experience, although the boat ran out of rum.. I could go on  on with how happy we were with everything.. We tried ALL the restaurants, except the Japanese  really liked them all-- It was a general consensus that our group really didn't like the beef down there.. It's a little different. The favorite was lunch at the Caribbean Grill on the beach. You can get burgers  dogs on the beach..If anyone went away hungry then shame on them.. I think our grouran out of it the last 2 days we were there.. The only beer is the island brand Presidente and Heineken.. How bad is that? Champagne whenever you wanted it.. We met a lot of Really nice people there from all over (alot of Americans)  it was so neat to see all the different people who tried to communicate with us from different countries dispite the language barrier.. As a previous review stated, beware the men in tan pants-- timeshare.. We forgot  gave them a couple of minutes but were able to walk away. A vacation really is all that you make of it  this one was a dream come true.. We shared some great times with some great friends  I would highly recommend this resort to anyone..

<Content>A 5 star? The resort is probably one of the better resorts to stay at in punta cana. But street cats, cockroaches and the quality of the food would probably make me rate this resort a 3+ or 4, definitely not 5. I would see street cats from time to time around the grounds which really did not bother me too much. The cockroach problem was solved by letting the front desk know and switching rooms. The food although much variety needs to improve in quality. The service and ambiance of the resort as well as the beachfront makes this resort score higher in my books.

<Content>Very Nice My husband and I just returned from the Paradisus and had a wonderful time. We were a little concerned after reading all the negative reviews and visiting the DR was a little off the beaten path for us. We've been to St. John, Barbados, Aruba and Cozumel. First, we booked through Vacation Express. I was pleasantly suprised with their service. We booked our vacation a couple of months in advance and they ran a special on our exact trip a couple of weeks before we were suppose to leave. I called about the pricing difference (about $1200) and completely expected to get screwed. Without any hassle or fuss, they gave us a voucher for $1200 to take another trip in a year through vacation express. Nice! The only other thing is that they make you get to the airport on departure very early. I'm not sure what the reasoning for it is. Our flight did not leave till 3:45 but we had to leave the hotel at 11:45 and it's about a 20 minute ride to the airport. We should have taken a taxi in hindsight. The airport is not air conditioned so be prepared!Ok, the resort was absolutely beautiful. They were constantly working on the grounds in some fashion. We had a 2nd room floor and we had no problems with bugs or anything. The maid did a good job keeping the room clean. In fact, even outside we only encountered the occasional mosquito. In St. John, USVI the noseeums can be brutal!The pool is amazing! We never had a problem getting a chair and hut and there was plenty of room to sunbathe. The beach was very nice...again, no problem getting a hut and chairs. There is some wave action but not so much where it was troublesome. There were lots of water activities to get into it. My husband and I took a Hobie Cat out a couple of times, we went on the snorkeling trip and horseback riding. We also booked a massage on the beach and that was incredible. As for the service, we had no problems. I found the Dominican people to be very helpful and friendly. I found that most of the wait staff understood basic english. The little bind that if they didn't understand me then they would get someone that did. The front desk has no problems speaking english as well. Regarding the food, there is room for improvement. I would classify it as mediocre. I also found that they cater to more of a european palate in the restaurants. If they could get the food up to the level of a cruise food then I think they would have a winner. El Romantico and the mexican restaurants are very good. We went shopping at Plaza Bavaro which is right outside the resort. We weren't sure what to expect but everything went well. Most shops have a guy stationed outside the store to try and entice you inside. We just ignored them and kept walking. After you go in the store, they leave you alone. There's not a lot of selection...all the stores pretty much have the same crap. However, if you go across the street, there is a great store called Zig Zag's that is run by a nice german lady named Petra. She sells hatian ironwork that is very nice and affordable. She also sells some of the neat little statues that you will find on display in the Paradisus lobby. One other little helpful hint...they won't cash traveler's checks into American dollars, only pesos. Overall, we had a very nice time. Looking back, the only thing I would change is to just improve the quality of the food.

<Content>Extremely disappointed I just returned from Punta Cana where I spent one week at the Paradisus All-inclusive resort. The exterior of the resort was actually very beautiful - lush well manicured grounds with an abundance of flowers. The beach was very clean and not too crowded. The lagoon pool was also very beautiful, but did not have ample number of chairs to accomodate guests. In fact, most areas were shaded by palms and tiki-like huts which didn't allow much sun-tanning around the pool unless you sat in the water. The biggest disappointments were the accomodations, food and service.Accomodations - We stayed on the ground floor of building #29. The room was very musty and damp. Although the chambermaids did a great job of cleaning the room each day, they did not have access to linens I would expect at a resort of this type. The bed sheets and covers were frayed and spotted with smoking holes or dirt that didn't wash out after laundering. Bath towels were scarce and extremely worn. Only after we tipped the chambermaid did we get more than one towel per person. (The norm at most resorts is two towels per person, a hand towel and wash cloth.) The air conditioning unit was stuck at a constant 60 degrees - freezing cold! Food - After having experienced Superclub resorts in Jamaica, Sandals in Jamaica, Club Med in Turks and Caicos and several all-inclusive resorts in Cancun, the food at Paradisus was terrible. The only truly edible food was at the Mexican restaurant. The worst - the Japaneese. The buffet was substandard. At most other restaurants and cruises the buffets are wonderful. Other than breakfast, I avoided the buffets.Service - Probably the most troubling was the service. Each morning I would come to the buffet for breakfast around 9:00 am. By then most of the tables were not cleared from the previous diners. I walked around table to table to find a clean fork, knife, napkin and coffee cup. The waiters and waitresses just stood there and watched. Disgusting! At the lobby bar, the bartenders aiting in line - even though I had been waiting longer. Almost comically, I was waiting for a drink when a 15 year-old boy came up to the bar after me. The waiter saw me, ignored me and serviced the young boy. No drinks were served around the beach or pool. you had to go get it yourself. Poolside and beachfront beverage service is quite common at resorts. Not this one! I was extremely disappointed in my vacation. The people of Dominican Republic are not ready for tourists.

<Content>It was very nice In general, it was very nice. On territory everything close:beach, our room, food, bar.Beach was not croudy. We liked almost everything.What we did not like: I could feel suer smell near the entrance to our suit,but not inside.We were on second floor. I don't how it was on first one.At the breakfest, sometimes it was a challenge to get glass of orange juice.But again, overall room,beach, food, service, watersports were very nice and did worth our money.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised My husband and I recently returned from a 5 day day stay at the Paradisus. I had read a number of negative reviews and was apprehensive since I'm sometimes described as too picky. We were pleasantly surprised. The entrance and and reception area is gorgeous. It is all open to the air with water pools, many places for sitting, lots of candles and beautiful plants. The grounds are spectacularly lush and pristine. Our room was spacious and nicely furnished. It was kept spotless each day by Isabel, our maid. The only problem was an insidious musty smell. We dealt with this by keeping the windows open whenever we were in the room. Despite the lack of screens, there were no bugs. There were many reastaurants to choose from which varied in quality. Our favorite food was the pizza which was thin-crust and grilled. The overall best meal of the day was breakfast with a buffet with enough variety to please most people. Lunch/dinner was inconsistent with service that was often uncoordinated. More than once we had 3+ servers for one meal which resulted in sub-par rather than excellent service. The exception to this was at El Romantico, where Kelly, our waiter gave exceptional service. But it wasn't a big deal once we knew what to expect. After all, we were on vacation and had no where to go except the pool or the beach! Both of which were gorgeous. All staff were exceptionally helpful, though many did not speak English (my limited Spanish was helpful). The exception to this was the high-pressure sales people who stop you to try and get you to tour another affiliated hotel to buy a time-share. Obnoxious. All in all it was a relaxing and beautiful place and we thoroughly enjoyed it!

<Content>Beautiful grounds All in all it was a nice experience. The food was sub par but the japanese restaurant was great. There was in my opinion a lack of night life. I don't gamble so the Casino was out and the karaoke bar did not open until 11:00 and so up to then there was not much to do. If you are going to relax and read make sure you bring plenty of reading material. They have very little to read there in English. The grounds and the beaches are superb. The pool area was beautiful as well.One turn off was the people with high pressure sales constantly trying to sell you things particularly time shares. They would not take no for an answer!

<Content>Wonderful Resort We just left that wonderful resort. We had a great stay. I would like to express my compliments about our maid, Rosa, Building 19. She was so sweet! Our room was spotless! What a treasure they have in her! I have only one issue-our bathroom needed repair. I will gladly recommend Paradisus Punta Cana at any time! Wonderful food, great waiters in Hibiscus, BRAVO-to El Romantico, they have the most wonderful food, We really Love the beach! Of course we are goin to come back!! And you should do so, too!

<Content>Great Hotel, Highly Reccommend It! My husband and I visited the Paradisus hotel in October of 2001, right after 9/11. We were nervous about traveling but figured if it was our time to go, then it wouldn't matter where we were. The hotel lobby was beautiful and they had drinks awaiting our arrival. The hotel staff was very courteous and although language was a barrier, it wasn't difficult to convey basic needs. I will say that one should avoid the tour of surrounding hotels because while the lunch and t-shirts are free, the tour takes all darn day (don't let them fool you-- It's really a time share pitch in disguise.) We had a few problems (bugs appeared after I left a fruity drink on the night table-bad move!!) and the bed seemed broke (maybe my husband and I broke it-who knows) but the staff fixed these things promptly. The Japanese restaurant and El Romantico where THE best restuarants there. I did not enjoy the townspeople as I found them to be rude and annoying. i was willing to spend about $400 on liquor and presents but after not receiving back change from the first store I was harrassed to shop in, I had my fill of the locals (the gift shop at the hotel was not that expensive and they were cheerful and friendly) . The main reason I would highly reccomend this hotel is months after my husband and I were back home in the states, I searched in vain on the internet for the Cigar factory (Don Lucas) we had toured while there and couldn't find a link. I emailed the hotel and they provided the link, a contact and phone for the factory the very next day after I emailed them. It just goes to show the level of service that they provide. My husband and I will always view the Paradisus as one of the best hotels we've been to everytime we hold our little souvenir Anayah Michelle, born nine months after our return from Punta Cana! :-)

<Content>Fabulous and Magnificent Resort! We just returned from a week at Paradisus and found it to be truly wonderful! We were so pleasantly surprised because of many of the negative reviews we had read. We were 9 family members ranging in age from 15 months to 70! We have traveled throughout the Carribean to many beautiful and upscale locales (including Nevis, Anguila, St. Barts, Jamaica, St. Thomas, British Virgins, Turks and Caicos, Bahamas, Barbados, etc.). This was clearly one of the most lush and beautiful, with an incredibly gorgeous beach. The people were extremely friendly and accommodating. The food was certainly not Le Cirque, but very good, plentiful, and fresh. While we were told the resort was fully booked, it never seemd crowded. We never waited on lines, we always got lounge chairs and huts at both the beach and the pool, and we were seated at every restaurant without a wait. This was truly a fabulous place. Make sure to check out massages on the beach in the afternoon, beach aerobics and yoga, and Cafe Romantico.

<Content>Fantastic and Fun, Worry Free Vacation First of all, forget all of the bad reviews that you read. I read them all and almost cancelled my trip. They scared the heck out of me. We just returned from 7 wonderful days at the Paradisus. We went through WORRY FREE VACATIONS and we truly had a worry free vacation. Every thing was on time, transportation was seemless and information was helpful. We were at the Paradisus from March 1st to March 8th. It was my sister and I and her (2) daughters 18 and 23. What a great week! The other guests were wonderful and very friendly. We have some great memories with them. So....1st, our room. It was clean, air conditioned, and good water pressure. We also left about $2.00 a day for the maid. Our room was made up every day and was very clean. In fact, everywhere you look in the resort, staff is always cleaning. The grounds are impecable. 2nd, Food is good, not great, but you have several places to choose from everyday. If you don't like one place, get up and go to another. Don't drink the tap water, it is not purified for drinking, only for cleaning and washing. All the resorts serve bottled water and even the ice is made from bottled water. It is very safe. 3rd, Drinks, all liquor is premium, if you enjoy drinking and like to try different drinks, you will love it.4th, the Pool is awsome. Never crowded, very big and clean. We always found chairs. We would put our towels out around 8:00 am and go have breakfast around 9:00. 5th, shopping. We had lots of fun bartering with the shops. We had no idea what things cost, so we did not know what to offer, but it was a fun experience. 6th, Excursion to Catalina Island. It was actually 3 trips in one and was way too much to do in one day. We were gone for 13 hours and we were exhausted. Although it was a great way to see the country, I would recommend a shorter excursion. 7th, Check-in, we arrived about 3:00pm and had to wait about an hour for our room. Big deal, we went and had a drink and looked around at things while we waited. The best part of this resort is that it never seemed crowded. You never really have to wait in line for anything, not even at check-in or check out. The beach was wonderful and you might have to put out your towels early to get a chair. OVERALL, THIS WAS A WONDERFUL TRIP AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THE PARADISUS TO ANYONE AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. REMEMBER TO MAKE YOUR OWN FUN AND ENJOY!!!!

<Content>Paradise Is Very Nice!!!! Surveying the reviews on this website prior to departing on my vacation made me both nervous and excited. The negative feedback about the air conditioning, stray cats and sewage smell was quite daunting. I am pleased to say that both my girlfriend and I have just returned with spectacular reviews of this resort. We stayed for five nights and did not have one complaint about the staff, grounds, smell or room. As long as you don't set your expectations on the food too high (Emeril Lagasse it is not), I think you will be pleasantly surprised. We ate at the Romantico, Japanese, Mexican, Seafood and Italian restaurants. The Italian one you can skip. We stayed in Bungalow 12, which was in close proximity to both the pool and the beach. As far as air conditioning, no problem in this bungalow. It actually got a tad bit cold in the room, which was a welcomed surprise. The cleaning staff was great. I suggest bringing a handful of one-dollar bills and leaving them $2 each morning with a note (in Spanish) asking for extra towels and to restock your fridge. Every time we did so, we got what we asked for.The beaches were beautiful and as long as you get outside around 9-10AM there should be no problem getting a chair. The casino was awesome and we did not have to exchange money once. For American gamblers, they have casino chips that equate to dollar amounts. For other gamblers they have chips that equate to the Dominican Peso. It was really very accommodating that way. The other vacationers were a 50-50 split between American and European. Everyone got along real well, except maybe some obnoxious French guys on the beach volleyball court. They won?t even help us in the United Nations so I didn?t expect them to bump, set or spike well for our team either.As far as other negative reviews, I will say that I did see some stray cats outside on the grounds, but never in a room. Furthermore, there was the slightest smell of garbage on the grounds, but not at all noticeable. Overall, it was an amazing place that I would go back to in a second. As the name suggests, it was truly Paradise.

<Content>The Real Deal.... Want the real deal review. well here you go. My wife and I have traveled to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Aruba, St. Martin, Jamaica, Cancun, Cozumel, St. Barts, St. John and St. Martin. This gives you an idea of what we compare it to. The beach at Punta Cana is one of the nicest I have ever seen. You can walk for miles and have no problems. The ocean is on the atlantic side, so it had some waves but nothing serious (not dead calm like Aruba). The resort has two areas the main entrance (lobby, casino, 2 bars, gift shop, stage) and the bungalow area (bungalows, pool, most dining). The two areas are connected by a 5 minute walk or quick golf cart ride. As any huge resort, the bungalows are spread out. I specifically asked the person at check in to put us close to the ocean, knowing that we wanted to be close to the beach. This was key in my mind, since obtaining a spot on the beach with an hut can be competitive. Lets put it this way, there are 1000 guests and about 30 huts you do the math. Every morning, my wife or I would run outside around 7am and claim our hut and go back to bed until 9. If we were a 5-10 minute walk to the beach this would have been a pain. The food well breakfast and lunch are buffet. What can you expect from buffet food? Not much in my opinion. Breakfast was better than lunch, since they will make eggs to order. We found the Mexican and Japanese were the best. We didnt eat a buffet once for dinner, which was key since we are picky. Although, no meal was mind blowing (again, what do you expect when they make food in mass quantity?) 24 hour room service is a JOKE the menu is horrible. If you are going on this vacation for food, you should go to Aruba where you buy you own meal every night. The room is nice, no problems. Not 5 star like a Ritz or Four Season, but nice. Not one problem with the AC (bungalow 19). We left a couple dollars a day for housekeeping which got us 4 cold beers, extra towels and candles. definitely worth it. I dont want to babble email me with specific questions if you like

<Content>Liked the Paradisus 1) The hotel grounds were equivalent to what we've seen at Ritz Carlton's in California and Naples Fla. ie,extraordinarily maintained and landscaped. 2) The people were very nice and appreciated it if you at least attempted to use Spanish. It did help to know how to speak Spanish since housekeepers, airport people, restaurant staff were not very versed in English at all. 3) The restaurant food was OK but inconsistent. It depended on what was ordered. Meats were very good. Breads and some fruits, other than pineapple were not so good. We liked the Rodizio and Romantico restaurant the best. El Romantico and the Japanese restaurants required reservations. We found it best to fax a reservation before the trip. We did this with Romantico and had it honored on our very first night. Otherwise, you may wait a couple of days for an opening. We ate dinner around 7:00 pm and never had a wait. The Italian restaurant was awful. 4) The beaches are beautiful 5) The pool and swim up bar were terrific. But it is almost impossible to get a lounge chair at the pool. 6) The all inclusive deal, especially with drinks included, was well worth it. If you order a glass of wine at diiner, expect to get an entire bottle. 7) The Punta Cana airport return was confusing. They changed our flight number, nothing was posted. There was no gate information and hardly any indication that the flight was delayed 2 hours. Fortunately, I was able to communicate in Spanish andk new what was happening. A number of older people seemed very lost. We helped as much as possible to direct them. 8) Forgot to mention... Do not use the tap water for drinking. They give you plenty of bottled water. The water used in restaurants is all filtered. We drank it with no problem.9) The water activities were included but there were too many people using them. As a result, it is easy to get shut out. We were told that snorkeling could only be reserved a day prior to our requested date. However, when we returned on Wednesday to book for Thursday, they were filled up for the week. Go figure. No use complaining- it means nada. They know that if you are put off long enough you will be leaving for home

<Content>Kicked out My parents decided that it would be great to take my sister and me to this resort for the family vacation. We arrived for a great 10 day vacation. We had two suites, one of which had no a/c. When we complained it took them two days to come over and that was because I hunted down somebody. The smell of sewage is all over the place. When asked not to put salt on the meals, it could have been the complete opposite. After having 9 days at the resort my parents recieved a phone call stating that we needed to check out. When they where informed that we where staying 10 days they stated that they did not have that information. I went to the front desk and asked to see a copy of the arrival paperwork and there it was. I asked to speak to the manager and he acted like it had been our fault and did not say sorry. I will not go back to this resort again.

<Content>Paradisus=paradise I was at the Paradisus from 1.-15.Feb.2003, and I loved every moment of it. Although I arrived late at night, check in was fast and they immediately took me to my room with a shuttlebus. The room was clean and with a friendly welcome-present.Each day the room was made there was a little gift on the table, a bottle of barcelo rum, a small statue etc.The ground itself is marvelous,you can walk through green woods and mangroves without really seeing any buildings. And the lobby was just gorgeous!The native people/staff were very friendly, even if you can麓t speak spanish you can communicate in english/french/german, it always works somehow. And the guys of the animation all spoke english and/or french. They have a natural cheerfulness and curiosity, although I was there as a single I never really got bothered, but they even tried to take care of me.The evening shows with the dancing group were just fantastic! Next time I should bring a video-camera.The food was ok, and you had the choice between many various restaurants. So anyone could find something he liked.It was a perfect vacation, and I will surely return.

<Content>A wonderful resort This is a wonderful resort. The grounds, room, beach and pool are wonderful. If you go to the pool, order a Ramone or Franco special: both were delicious. Water aerobics, lots of water activity options, and a very reasonable price. The casino was a lot of fun too. I really can't understand the negatives from some of the reviews-- it was a very good value. The food wasn't 5 star, but it was very good. I had an omlette every am for breakfast and it was wonderful. Lunch at the Italian or the grill was also very good. I would recommed this resort to anyone.

<Content>Great for families, couples, conferences My wife, 6 year-old daughter, and I visited for a week-long association conference in mid-February, 2003. The experience was a 9 out of 10. It would have been a 10 if any of us spoke Spanish. The staff tries very hard, but it is still a little bit frustrating at times. An outstanding exception to the above is Marie in the kid's Mini Club. She is fluent in English, French, German, Spanish, and is learning Italian. She and the Mini Club were wonderful for our daughter, even though she was the only English-speaking child until our last day. Kids don't need much communication to play. They provide 2-3 hour activity sessions for the kids (ages 4-12) in late morning, late afternoon, and late evening. It was all our daughter wanted to do! They take care to make sure the kids rejoin their parents. The grounds of the Paradisus are extremely lush and well maintained. Because the vegetation provides so much visual shielding, only at the beach and the primary dining court is there any clue of how many people are there. The rooms are very comfortable, however, the double beds seemed smaller than typical hotel sizes. The food is better than average, and in some cases (especially desserts) a real treat. With most of the restaurants being open-air and arranged around a central courtyard, it was possible to select food from more than one restaurant at a single meal. TIPS: be sure to take plenty of sun screen; take a little bit of insect repellent (we got a few insect bites, but only during three evenings); when you first arrive, take a little time to walk the grounds with a map - although things are well marked, the irregular layout can be a little disorienting at first; take some small US $ bills - tipping is not customary here or with Europeans, so it is not expected and brings out the best in service IF necessary; we tipped our room maid $5.00 US almost every day, but if you cannot hand it to them in person, be sure to put it in a sealed envelope labeled for them - employee security is tight!; pack light - except for the Japanese and Gourmet restaurants, dress codes are relaxed with only a shirt or coverup required over bathing suits, and no bare feet permitted; unless you like to shop or gamble or take off-site excursions, don't bring a lot of cash - $100-200 US in travelers checks per person should be more than enought. ENJOY!!

<Content>Good Weight Loss Clinic... I will start off by saying the grounds were beautiful...like being in the middle of a jungle paradise; however that's where all the positives stop. The A/C like others have noticed, was not functional upon arrival. We changed rooms to find working A/C, but non working refrigeration in the mini refrigerator. The toilet did not work correctly, but the room was very nice overall.The area of major concern to me, is in what appears to me in my opinion, to be the heavy odor of what smelled like raw sewerage on the grounds and again in my opinion, to be a possible contamination of the food supply or what appeared to be a lack of cold enough temperatures of the food and drinks at the food counters. By the second day of the vacation, both my wife and myself became very ill and we were unable to eat anything further without violent results. We switched to eating only small portions of bread followed by bottled beer in order to consume some carbohydrates and sugars. This helped us to make it through, but barely. In all my visits to the Domincan Republic, I have never been ill like this.The food was terrible at best and not consumable at the least, in my opinion. Add in the horrible smells from constant air pollution caused by all of the worn out motors from the trolley's and motorbikes used by the staff and you have the recipe for a difficult vacation. I would find another resort with less traffic and possibly safer food.The beach chairs are extremely uncomfortable, making extended sun tanning difficult unless you lay on the sand. The trash bin plastic bags on the beach where never removed for change; the attendant would only reach in by hand and remove the dumped daily garbage by hand and transfer the contents to his bag, leaving old food matter constantly drying in the receptacles or on the ground around the bins. It is almost impossible to communicate with anyone at any restaurant. My wife has an allergy to garlic and they put garlic in virtually everything. I asked each and every waiter to avoid garlic (in spanish) but I don't even think they know what garlic is. We ended up with garlic in almost any food item ordered or any item offered at the buffet.The only positive result of the trip was the loss of 6 pounds of weight, which now puts me back at my waist size during college. I would also avoid TNT tours, the first class extra we paid for was a joke.Happy vacationing!

<Content>Beautiful Resort, would definitely recommend!!! We visited the Paradisus Feb 8-12, 2003. After reading many of the reviews, I was a little nervous about going. I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by the resort and definitely disagree with the negative reviews. First of all, check in was quick and smooth. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. Very lush and well kept. The beach is awesome. Turqoise water with nice size waves (remember you're on the Atlantic) We walked for miles and were never bothered by anyone trying to sell us stuff. Although we chose to sit in the sun the entire time, there were tons of things we could have done (golfing, horseback riding, catamarans, windsurfing etc, all included). The pool was just as awesome. Even though the resort was at full capacity, it never felt crowded. The food was pretty good (Brazilian stood out probably as the best), but all that we tried were decent. Our room was great. We were in building 9 which was close to everything (only a few steps to the beach, pool or restaurants), but still so hidden and quiet as are all the other bungalows. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Most spoke Spanish, English, French and German (at least a little of each). This was a very European crowd, Americans were a minority. Although some people were complaining of damp, musty rooms, ours was neither. Our A/C worked very well. In fact, we would often have to turn it down because it was too cold!! I rate this resort 4 out of 5 stars because of the OK food and subpar nightly entertainment. Everything else was AWESOME!!! If you're thinking about going, just DO IT! It's worth it...

<Content>Going Back!!! We went for 5 days in February 2002, it was a valentine's trip. We had a great time. We also had the best room on the resort. Sorry, can't tell you the room number. The staff was exteremly friendly. Breakfast is excellent. However, the other dining places are ok. The bar staff is excellent and the beach is really something else. You gotta love the swin-up bar. And those coconut drinks are great. Planters Punch drinks, execellent. We loved it so much, we are going back this year, in February, for 7 days. Also thinking about making it a yearly trip.

<Content>Perfect family vacation. We visited the Paradisus Punta Cana from 1.11.2003 to 1.18.2003. We traveled with a six year old and a three year old. We found the resort to be beautiful, the staff friendly, and the food good. The staff tried hard to speak English and met every request that we made. We loved the resort and would go back.

<Content>Tropical Paradise It is truly a tropical paradise! My husband, son (21), daughter (20) and I just got back - stayed week of Jan. 4, 2003 thru Jan. 11. The grounds and beach are fabulous. The rooms look just like in the brochures. Leave $2.00 a day for housekeeping and they will keep you stocked in your favorite soda's (just leave a note) will leave fresh flowers and extra towels. We ate at the French, Spanish, Mexican, Brazilian, Japaneese, Italian, Grille and the breakfast buffet all were great. Knowing a little spanish will help. All 4 of us took scuba lesson and went on dive. Matt the instructor was terrific, they have a video photographer go on dive and film. Well worth $47.00 for copy of tape. Truly outstanding experience. Will definitely go back.

<Content>Our room was "Gone in 60 seconds!" When we arrived at the Paradisus the rooms were unavailable along with 35 other visitors that day. Apparently, the hotel has a policy with overbooking and shipped us off to another lower quality resort. It could have been worse. A few people were put into accomodations that only had one light bulb for both the bathroom and guest room! Worst of all, when the staff realized that there were no rooms, they avoided us and hid in the office without telling us what was happening. It was only after arrangements had been made (2.5 hours later) that we found out our room was not available. As you can imagine, we were not happy.Be very cautious as another family had an email confirmation from the Paradisus General Manager which seemed to work for them.

<Content>Check-in at 5PM the next day Beautiful grounds, nice rooms.Good luck getting a room. We prepaid for 6 rooms, but upon arrival were given only 2 rooms until 6 PM the next day. They stated that they overbooked 40-70 rooms a night. Over half of the new arrivals were sent elsewhere, but usually they kept one room of large groups so people would return. Completely inexcusable for prepaid rooms. People were furious, but the manager would not see anyone. There was VERY poor communication by the management. The staff tried very hard but could use a LOT more training. In addition, for 1000 guests, they had about 600 beach/pool chairs. You had to steal a chair from one of the restaurants or another guest to sit at the beach/pool!The food was inconsistent. Sometimes great, another time I had a lobster tail so overcooked it was like mashed potatoes.

<Content>Over rated versus Beaches My family of four just returned from a one week vacation to Paradisus Punta Cana. After having been to Beaches Turks and Caicos twice, and Beaches Negril once, my family had great expectations. At best this is a three star resort, with gorgeeous common areas, and nothing else outstanding. The rooms are nice sized, but ordinary. The food is fair to poor. You can always find the odor of garbage or spoiled food, at most restaurants. While the resort is all inclusive, my family of 4, including an 18 year old and 15 year old, found it very difficult to utilize m any water sport activities, like sailing, snorkling, wind surfing, or boating. The water sports areas are administered by a leased party, and the personel have next to no interest in giving insrtuction, or paying attention. We also experienced CATS in our hotel room. Spend slightly more money, and travel to Beaches either T C or Negril. Much better vacation value!!!

<Content>The vacation from hell This was the worst vacation I have ever had! This was our honeymoon, but we ended up leaving the vacation after just two days. The flight down was uncomfortable-small seats, cramped etc. The hotel grounds smell like sewer, although the plants and lobby are very pretty.Our a/c was broken, there was mold growng on the walls, the toliet was broken, the fridge was not cold. The room was filthy--our sheets still had sand in the from the guest that stayed in them before us. People had to check into three or four rooms until they found a room that was not occupied. The hotel did not keep track of who is in what room. Other guests has keys to our room. We were up untill 1:00 AM trying to get the staff to service our room. All we wanted was a clean room. We called 6 or 7 times, and had no response. We talked to the front desk where we saw guests and staff fighting about the hotel. People were sleeping on hotel couches because they had overbooked the hotel. Every guset we spoke to was unhappy. We left the next day for home and spent the rest of the week sick from what we had eaten at that hotel. The food is unsafe and disgusting! DO NOT VACATION HERE!

<Content>Cancel Your Reservation, ASAP! -I hope you like cats because we had 3 STRAY CATS IN OUR ROOM!- The food is unedible. Half of our party became sick. The cafeteria smelled like a hospital. There was absolutly no variation in meals day to day. There wasn't even peanut butter and jelly or bagels. No creative presentation of food. -The rooms were fair HOWEVER...We visited the Paradisus the 2nd week ok Christmas Break and the resort was overbooked. There were not enough rooms for all of the guests (about 15% of the guests). Guests had to stay at other resorts (some resorts up to 20 minutes away by car). Some guests were so outraged that a fight broke out in the lobby and furniture was thrown. Some parties were bumped from the resort for an ENTIRE week.- The pool is nice however it is not deep enough to swim in- Do not get your hair braided. We witnessed the same man who braided someone's hair used the same comb to comb HIS EYEBROWS while we were sitting there!- The only good part about the resort was the grounds. They were beautiful and well maintained.The paradisus was overrated!!

<Content>Beware for overbookings, poor treatment and bad faith! We arrived, my wife, two children and I, at 4 in the morning on Christmas day after an exausting trip (including a five hour flight delay from Miami) to be told that our hotel reservation was not in the hotel's system (notwitstanding us showing a paper copy of our fully confirmed Cititravel reservation). We were asked to wait until things cleared up. By 9:30, the day manager arrived and told us it was the travel agency's fault that never confirmed the reservation. To make a long story short, we eventually managed to learn that the hotel was heavily overbooked and the manager had bet on us not showing up, arbitrarily canceling our well-confirmed reservation ahead of time. Upon threatening to call the police, a room became suddenly available (I have great news for you...), but at twice the rate we had booked for. We understood this was the clean way to get rid of excess, recalcitrant customers and finally left the Paradisus by noon after finding a room at the excellent next door Hodelpa Caribe Club where we were warmly welcomed and had a wonderful time. In the end things turned out much for the better!Alain Ize

<Content>Lovely but not 5*+++ My husband and I spent our 2 week honeymoon at the Paradisus from December 5- December 20. All in all I thought it was a very nice vacation however I did not think it was worth the extra money. We have stayed in many 5*all inclusives in Mexico and have also done a fair amount of traveling in Canada, the US and Europe. The grounds indeed were beautifull and we have some excellent pictures. The tropical birds on the grounds were also nice ie parrots, flamingos, peacocks and finches.We thought the food was quite good but we did not eat at all at the buffet restaurant and instead only ate at the a la carte restaurants. We both thought the Romantica and the Italian restaurants were the best. Neither of us cared for the Brazillian restaurant and the japanese restaurant and chinese restaurants were mediocre. The service we thought was excellent and it certainly did help if you could at least try to speak a little spanish and a few american $$$ went along way!! Room service was 24 hrs a day and was incredibly quick I don't think we ever waited longer than about 15 minutes for anything.The Beaches are breathtaking but very similar to that in Cancun or Play del Carmen. The pool was also very nice. My husband seemed to have more difficulty in ordering from the bars than I did. He sometimes waited up to 10-15minutes for a drink however if I went up I never waited longer than a couple of minutes we figured this out in the first couple of days so it really was not a problem.The rooms were okay they certainly weren't spectacular by any stretch of the imagination. We never had any problems with the air conditioning however we did have a couple of leaks under our bathroom sink and our shower acted up a couple of times. They were very good to come and fix things when you requested this. This hotel is approx 6 years old and I think that if left the way it is, in a few years this won't be a 5 * resort anymore. Things are just on the verge of needing upgrading.If you do go on your honeymoon make certain to stress this to the front desk as you will receive a lovely gift on your nightstand each night you stay. Don't bother trying to book reservations for the restaurants through your travel agent before you go as if you do when you get to the restaurant they will want to see your reservation ticket and the only way to get one of these is to book the restaurants while you are there.All in all a very nice vacation but certainly no nicer than what we have been to in mexico and unfortunately almost 2X the price.

<Content>will never return We just returned from a week at Paradisus and we will never return. I understand that the two weeks surrounding Christmas and New Year's is the busiest time but I found the lack of preparedness by the resort appalling. Several guests who did not book thru a major travel co (e.g. Apple) were left with no rooms with bogus offers to be tranported to other comparable resorts that d never materialized. There was the daily fight for poolside and beach lounges. The survival of the fittest mentality only grew worse as the week went on. Unless you staked out your lounge with a twel, book, sandal, or other object, you could not expect to find a lounge after 8:30 a.m. Beach towels were often not available for long periods during the day. We found ouselves raiding the maid carts for the room towels to take to the beach. Many, if not most, of the employees have limited, if any, understanding of English. I heard parents complaing that drinks ordered wihout alcohol for their children came more often with alcohol as the bartenders did not often seem to comprehend. Forget about the tram drivers or the maids understanding. Activities for the teens to college aged visitors were scarce. Other activities such as snorkeling were limited. As an example, we wanted to go snorkeling. There five in our group. We were told we had to sign up 24-48 hrs in advance and that the two trips ( one hour) were already filled. Each trip had only 8-10 people. It waasn't until we started complaing that all of the sudden another trip was added in the afternoon. Why should we have to grovel for towels, lounges, activities when we are paying very steep price? But still, what was most appalling was the fact that the management, after requiring 100% prepayment, overbooks rooms. To me this is outright dishonesty. I'm not going to get into the restaurant hassles. I will say the beach, pool, and grounds are beautiful (altho they could make the ramps in the lobby more wheelchair accessible--very steep). Our rooaily (this, and my high school spanish and a pocket translator helped me get my needs met). In summary, our group of fifteen adults and kids were unanimous in agreeing we would never return. Management needs a complete overhaul.

<Content>Perfect We got married at the Paradisus in Dec. of 2002. We planned the entire wedding over the internet and were a bit nervous never having seen the resort. We had over 50 family members and friends join. All I can say is that it is truly paradise. Our wedding could not have been more perfect. After our wedding we decided to head up to Bayhiebe (s.p.) to check out some other resorts. We hated it. We immediately called our travel agent and came back to Punta Cana. This time to the Melia Caribe  Tropical which is run by the same company as Paradisus. We loved it there too.

<Content>Great Time Spent 5 nights at this absolutely beautiful hotel. Everything was perfect. The staff is wonderful and really go out of their way to make your stay everything it should be. Although most staff speak very little english, if you try a couple of the spanish words provided in the book given to you at check-in they really respond. The restaurants are good, not great, but their is plenty of everything to please everyone. The pool is like none that I've ever seen and the sit around in water bar is fun, fun. The lobby bar is also great. A different show each night with same group of entertainers. They are fabulous dancers and the costumes are over the top. Audience participation is a real blast.

<Content>A Really Hot Resort First the positives--gorgeous beach and wonderful surf. Restaurants were very good. Very nice pool.However, we spent 12 days with no air=conditioning. Temps were 85-92 with high humidity. Our requests for help were conscientiously ignored. Communication among staff at various restaurants, lobby, customer service is very poor. We love the area and will go back, but probably not to the Paradisus.

<Content>some good, some not so good The positives: beautiful resort, very clean grounds, great beach, and pool. Negatives: coming from NY, maybe we're spoiled, but the food, while abundant, was lousy. Our room was nice, but the AC does not work...in most of the rooms. The refrigerator (for the mini bar), just made the beverages slightly below room temperature--not very refreshing. My wife is fluent in Spanish, but for travelers who do not speak Spanish---good luck. We witnessed several travelers who had problems communicating their needs due to the language barrier. Overall, I think Punta Cana, and The Paradisus will develop in to a true 5 star resort, but it will take a few more years.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation This was our second trip to Punta Cana and we loved it more than the first time. The beaches with the rows of palms trees and calm aquamarie waters are superior to many islands we have visisted. The restaurant selection at the Paradisus for an all inclusive are excellent as are the food selections in them. The staff at the hotel are friendly and will try their hardest to please you. This is a relaxing vacation spot. It is not Cancun with all the action there but it is a wonderul place to unwind and dine.We will definitely go again.
