<Content>Loved the Nadia I stayed at the Nadia with my partner and two friends over 2008 New Year.I booked the hotel mainly due to its location - it is about 5 mins walk behind Dam Square which is great for being able to pop back throughout the day amongst the sightseeing.The Nadia is very warm and welcoming. The stairs on arrival looked daunting but after using them a few times you soon get used to them.The room was very small but it was fine, functional, warm  comfortable. It was also very clean and the room was cleaned daily.I can't fault the Nadia, price location and hospitality were excellent and we will be going back.

<Content>Quaint, friendly and perfectly located. We went to Amsterdam for New Year 2008 and decided to stay at the Hotel Nadia for the third time. Before considering the Hotel Nadia you must consider Amsterdam as a whole. It is a vibrant beautiful city but not the most accessible at times. If you are deciding on which hotel to stay at and are concerned about the size or layout of the hotel then you simply must realise that this is Amsterdam and everything is condensed.With that in mind on with the review....The Hotel Nadia is quite simply the most friendly hotel we have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. The staff are always approachable and will always greet you with a friendly hello. Nothing is too much to ask from them and they have given us some great advice and help over the years. When you arrive at the Hotel you will be greeted not only by a friendly member of staff but also a daunting stairway up into the main reception area. I can not sum up just how daunting the stairs are at first but as mentioned before this is Amsterdam and everywhere is like that here. But I promise you that you do get used to the stairs and the staff are always willing to shuttle your luggage up for you. Once you are up the stairs you are greeted with a complimentary drink (much needed!) We were also greeted in our room by a fantastic bouquet of flowers welcoming us back home and its really apt as staying here is like staying with friends more than staying in a hotel. The rooms are small (again like most hotels in Amsterdam) but furnished wonderfully with some really quirky features. Everything you need in your room is there (Shower, WC, Fridge, Safe, TV with tons of channels etc) but the best rooms are ones with a balcony as the view is tremendous as you can see the stunning Westerkerk from your room but also the canal that runs alongside the building. The location is perfect as its central enough to make most important sights a mere five minute walk (Anne Frank House, Red Light District, Dam Square) and also slap bang in the middle of two supermarkets and a load of little cafes and restaurants that are also reasonably priced as they are slightly off the beaten track. There are also some lovely boutique shops two minutes away along the canal. It is the safest hotel we have ever stayed in too, Amsterdam can be quite boisterous at times what with stag weekends etc but thankfully Nadia is a family hotel that avoids the usual tourist groups due to its location. The hotel manager is also a great security plus in the hotel as he is a lovely man but you certainly wouldn鈥檛 want to get on the wrong side of him!!Breakfast is more than acceptable offering coffee, juices, teas, bread, toast, croissants and various cakes. The breakfast room itself is a sight to behold as it is beautiful. We have dietary requirements when staying in a hotel and this was and never has been a problem for us in the Nadia. All in all I have nothing to say other than good things about the Hotel Nadia. If you are looking for a flashy sterile five star hotel then this probably isn鈥檛 the place for you.But if you are looking for a safe, reasonably priced friendly hotel with awesome five star staff and a wonderful location then I strongly suggest booking the Nadia ASAP. Just don鈥檛 book it when we want to stay here because I don鈥檛 think we could ever stay anywhere else even if it was a five star hotel for free! We would miss the staff here far too much and it would feel like we were cheating on them! That how much we love of this hotel.

<Content>What a wonderful place! A friend of us recommended us very warmly this family-owned hotel located very close to the City Center (Dam).Upon contacting the management for the booking, they reacted in a snap and in a very friendly and customer centric manner. Despite the busy season (Christmas), they accomodated our room wishes. The rates were very competitive, really.Upon arriving we felt immediately at home, the welcome was great, personnalized, focused on our needs. The management and the staff were always available and smiling; the tips about the city were great, accurate; in short it was as if a friend was telling us about his/her city. Small but comfortable and very clean (with all amenities), our room had a wonderful view over the Canal and the Westerkerk. The breakfasts were generous and delicious. Just a note (posted on the hotel's website btw) : this hotel is not really suitable for elderly or disabled people because of the steep access stairs. If you need a very quiet room, you can ask for a courtyard room (the inner garden is charming).Overall, we will go back to the Nadia Hotel without hesitation when we travel to Amsterdam again. It's our turn now to spread the word of mouth and warmly recommend this nice and wonderful place !

<Content>top hotel we stayed for 2 nights at the NADIA in Dec 2008. Excellent hotel with OSAM the manager leading the team of very friendly staff. Nothing was any trouble to any of them, a credit to themselves!! We will definetly use this hotel again should we visit Amsterdam. The only downside to our trip were the prices of the beer.......eg, 2 x pints of guinness 16 euros??? ridiculous. Amsterdam will need to seriously lower its very extortionate beer prices to attract our custom again!!! Dont hesitate to book into the NADIA tho, although small rooms, top service guaranteed!!

<Content>Hotel Nadia was perfect Hotel Nadia was great. I spent the weekend there with my boyfriend. It was really close to Dam Square and easy to find. The staff were great all the way through our stay, really friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying our stay. They carried our bags to the room and we had free welcome drinks. The room was small as expected but it was clean, warm and comfortable. I will definitely stay at Hotel Nadia when I visit Amsterdam in the future.

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent service Charming hotel right in the middle of everything. Reception and other staff were very welcoming and even gave us welcome drinks! Little touches like carrying our bags to our room, welcome drinks, personal recommendations about where to dine etc make this hotel fantastic! I thoroughly recommend this hotel to anybody, and the central location just tops it off!

<Content>wonderfully charming place My boyfriend and I just stayed 3 nights at the Nadia and could not have been happier with our experience. The woman working the reception desk when we arrived was warm and helpful, and our bags were waiting in our room for us by the time we finished checking in. Our room was very small but the wardrobe and plentiful shelving made it feel bigger. The lighting and decor were both very cute -- overall it was incredibly cozy and comfortable, and it could not have been cleaner (same for the bathroom). The breakfast room was delightful, too -- especially since it was decorated for Christmas. There were several ladies working to make sure there was also fresh coffee and juice. The entire staff were always friendly and helpful -- they helped us arrange for a shuttle service to the airport at the end of our visit, and helped us down with our bags. Security at the hotel is very good -- they monitor the always-locked front door via camera and don't allow in anyone who is not a registered guest, so you can be comfortable that there's never anything too shady going on in the rooms around you. The hallways smelled pretty strongly of cigarette smoke at times, which didn't bother us since our room never smelled smoky at all. But people who are extremely sensitive to cigarette smoke might be bothered. Our room was on the interior side of the building (not directly exposed to the street) so outside sound was no problem whatsoever. I do think the walls between the rooms and the hallway must be very thin, because we could hear people passing by and/or talking in the hallway very clearly. It was never particularly bothersome but if we had visited at a more crowded time of year it might have gotten annoying. Though you can always sleep with earplugs.The location could also not have been better -- it is very close to Dam Square but just enough out of the bustle and mayhem that you are able to really relax. We discovered a number of wonderful restaurants and bars within a 5-10 minute walk of the hotel. Overall we were thrilled with the Nadia, and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Amsterdam Experience at Nadia Hotel - 11/20/08 to 12/2/08 My sister and I have been all over the world but our vacation in Amsterdam at the Nadia Hotel has been by far the best ever yet!Nadia Hotel is centrally located in downtown Amsterdam - just walking distance to the Ann Frank House, the Dam Square, the Central Station, Kalverstraat, the deBijenkorf department store, and pretty much all of downtown Amsterdam. Our bedroom overlooked the canal, wich I believe would be a stunning view during the summer, but given the weather situation during our visit, was still a sight to behold. The charming little kitchen (with a balcony and overlooking the canal), serves breakfast from 7:30 to 10:30. Breakfast was something we never missed as it made dining so much more enjoyable. What a way to start your day! Mr. Osam, the owner, and his wonderful staff, were always at our beck and call. Their boundless hospitality made leaving Nadia Hotel even much more difficult. My sister always said that she would never go back to the same place twice, but given the royal treatment we received, she would make an exception to this case. We would definitely recommend Nadia Hotel to all future travelers, if they make Amsterdam their next vacation choice. For me, this hotel deserves a 5 star.

<Content>Wonderful Stay A big Thank You to the owner and staff of Nadia Hotel. This hotel is clean, safe, cozy, and romantic. It is in a great location, so walking to many places of interest is easy and fun. Even though I liked the hotel very much, my favorite part about it (besides the cleanliness and overall pleasing atmosphere) is the superb staff. They are very friendly, helpful, and generous. I am especially grateful to the owner and his very kind and respectful son. They were both gracious. So even though the room was small, and yes, the staircase is steep, I will always stay at this hotel when visiting Amsterdam, and have already highly recommended it to family and friends.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Just returned from an eight day stay at Nadia. This was my fourth stay at Nadia in two years. The hotel is very conveniently situated - 5 min. walk from Dam Square, 10 min, from Centraal Station, Tram 14 stops in front of hotel, the Anne Frank House is 1-1/2 blocks away. Although the rooms are small and the stairs are steep and numerous, the rooms very clean, and quite cozy. Each room is equipped with a fridge, TV, safe, and free WIFI . They serve a more than adequate continental breakfast in the charming breakfast room. If you desire a more substantial breakfast, Sara's Pancake House next door has wonderful pancakes and omelets. The best selling point for Nadia is the 4-star service you receive in this 2-star hotel from the wonderful staff and manager, Osam. They are most helpful in providing information about the city and no request is too much for them. They treat each and every one of their guests as royalty. I highly recommend Nadia Hotel.

<Content>Nice accomodations Hotel Nadia is a great choice for accomodations in a city known for lots of crappy hotels. Nadia is in a beautiful building a short 5 min walk from Dam square. You can pretty much get to every landmark in this happening city from Hotel Nadia within a 20 min walk, or even quicker from a tram that stops 2 minutes away from the hotel. The front desk is staffed 24 hours a day with very helpful personnel, especially Osam, the property manager.Though rooms are really tiny (expected for the price and for Amsterdam), there is ample shelving for luggage; every room is equipped with a private shower and toilets; free breakfast is sufficient and included in the price. The quad room has a spectacular view and lots of room to hang out. For the reasonable price and excellent location, Hotel Nadia is a very good choice for Amsterdam!

<Content>Small but nice The location is great...you can easily walk to Centraal Station in about 10 minutes. The staff was very nice and helpful with directions to different places around the city.The rooms are really small- almost like staying in a train car! But if you are not planning to spend a lot of time in the room it is fine. The room was clean and quiet- I would stay here again.

<Content>Great Location but very small room The location of this hotel is perfect. Walking distance to so many attractions in Amsterdam. You can hear the bells of the Westkerk from your hotel room. However, I found the bathroom extremely small. It was like being in an airplane bathroom. There also appeared to be some sort of plumbing problem which resulted in a foul odor coming from the bathroom. Housekeeping was able to temporarily improve this problem, but the odor returned the next day. The staff was very friendly and helpful, except for one instance where the front desk disconnected my friend who was trying to call me.

<Content>Great Hotel and good location Stayed at the Hotel Nadia this week with 16 other people. When booking a hotel for so many people you have to do your homework and I trawled through tripadvisor and was concerned finding that the standard of hotels in Amsterdam had a lot to be desired and prices were really unreasonable. Then I came across the Nadia which had great reviews and good prices and within minutes of a reservation request online I had prices and availability confirmed and even a phone call. My only concern was I was unable to pay a deposit and I know I had confirmation e-mails but a deposit gives you that piece of mind (just a suggestion).Upon arrival and during our stay we were looked after really well so full marks to the staff - Thank you. As in all hotels in Amsterdam the rooms are small but they had everything you need for a short city break and most importantly they were very clean.Breakfast was standard continental and available for 3 hours.The hotel is located in a great location just a few minutes walk from Dam Square and all of Amsterdam's attractions can be reached easily on foot.One place you must visit is the Ice Bar - 15 euros and includes a drink, but its the experience of standing in a deep freeze with glasses and seating made of ice and you get great coats and hats to wear !! If you have spare time go on the half day trip to the windmills of Zaanse Sans and then onto the cheese factory (don't buy the cheese - if you really want some its half price at airport) and then to fishing village of Volendam. In these few hours you see the real Holland. Osam at reception can help you organise this trip.

<Content>great stay very enjoyable stay for both me and my girlfriend....had a lovly little room overlooking the canal. The hotel can best be described as quaint...its comfortable and clean but by far the biggest highlight was the service. Honestly the staff are very friendly and try to be as helpful as possible. its a 15 minute walk to the train station but the location is very central, next to dam square ten mins to red light and 15 mins to ledisplein square. Definately would stay here again.

<Content>Charming Hotel Nadia Hotel Nadia is a charming place to stay at the center of Amsterdam. Lovely small rooms but well equiped with comfortable bathroom (we stayed in room 7). Nice view on the Westerkerk and Keizersgracht. Warm welcome (nice flowers), friendly staff and good breakfast.Many highlights of Amsterdam on walking distance.The hotel is not suitable for disabled people because of the steep stairway.Remark : window(s) may need a replacement (difficult to open/close).

<Content>My second home I was welcomed again very friendly and warm. They gave me the feeling being at home. Nadia is a very nice and familial hotel, they fulfilled all my wishes, helped and gave very good hints of Amsterdam.My next stay in Amsterdam is for sure again at Nadia Hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel in Amsterdam Nadia is a nice hotel in the middle of downtown, clean, well distributed, wonderful coffee/breakfast rum, nice people at the reception desk. I really recommend it to all of you who want a good price hotel in Amsterdam. The only negative thing could be that they don't have any elevator and you have long stairs to go up for but on the other hand so are many hotels in Amsterdam!

<Content>Could'nt be more helpfull The Nadia hotel and it's staff especially ''Osam''(manager) were most friendly and helpful. As there was eight of us (4 couples) staying all the rooms were different, small, clean but comfortable. Breakfast was continental and plenty of it. The only draw back would be the stairs (not suitable for elderly) but this was not a problem for us even-though we had a room on the top floor. Ideally located close to Anne Frank's house, Dam square and Canal boat pickup Central Station 10 minutes on Tram would have no problem recommending this hotel. Richie. Sept /08Waterford Ireland.

<Content>Heading for Amsterdam? Choose the Nadia! I was headed to Amsterdam for an academic conference and, with no recommendations from the organizers, was falling victim to the pin-in-the-map method. My best friend's daughter, a travel agent, rescued me with the Nadia! What a terrific location: two blocks from the Anne Frank House, down the street from the gorgeous tower of the Westerkerk, and backing directly onto the famous Nine Streets. I found a delightful cafe with a tasty menu a few steps away (The Panorama), and a block beyond that, a post office (important to me) and a supermarche !! And just beyond that, the Dam itself. Couldn't be better--and the first day I walked along the Prinsengracht Canal from the Anne Frank House to the Rijkmuseum-- thirty minutes of wonderful scenes: that is, the Nadia is close to all the important Tram lines, but one can also stroll from its location in the Centrum quarter to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum in the Museum quarter.I paid around 100 Euros a night for my seven-day stay. My room was a single--compact, but everything well organized and placed: television; microwave; coffee machine--and VERY important for me, a truly useable DESK with an excellent READING LIGHT--so rare in any kind of hotel. The staff at the Nadia strives to personalize service; by day three, I could find my room key awaiting me at the top of the 37 steps to the reception area (this IS Amsterdam, after all--great for physical fitness!). By the time I left, I felt I had a personal relationship with at least four members of the staff (including the owner and not mentioning the two gorgeous cats). I travel alone to these conferences, and the Nadia made me feel I really did have a 'home away from home,' if you don't mind me sinking into cliche. A highlight was receiving a bouquet from the owner on the day I delivered my paper!If you are looking for a luxury hotel, the Nadia is not it--the fitness/spa aspect is the Stairs. But it you want a centrally located, reasonable, very pleasant and personalized hotel experience--the Nadia is for you! Happy Travels.terry

<Content>The Nadia gets better every time. This was our third visit and the welcome we get at the Nadia makes us feel as if we are visiting a Home from Home.All the staff seem to get along so well with each other and this is reflected in they way they treat their guests.Hopefully I can vsit there again while I am still young enough to climb the stairs!

<Content>We loved the Nadia! Great hotel! Staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The maid service was above and beyond the call of duty. The room was spotless and the heating was great which is important in wintertime. Nice and toasty when you get home after a night on the town. We would recommend the Nadia and will definitely be returning.There is a reason we did not give 5 stars. We booked a delux room. There were flowers in the room on arrival but there wasn't that little extra touch. In comparable hotels we have had things like chocolates on the pillow or a bottle of wine on arrival. This is not a complaint! Just explaining why its not 5 stars to us. Maybe we've been spoiled. Who knows? We loved the Nadia and will be booking here whenever we return to Amsterdam. Thanks again for a great stay guys!

<Content>Great Value Hotel with friendly and helpful staff My husband and I have just come back from a two night enjoyable stay at the Nadia Hotel in Amsterdam. The hotel and the staff are warm and welcoming nothing was too much trouble at anytime of the day. We had a lovely double room at the front of the hotel with our own balcony.For a two star hotel it was exceptional would rate it higher. We would definately stay there again. It was close to Dam Square and the major sites of the city everything was within walking distance, there are a couple of nice bars near to the hotel. Everything about this hotel was excellent and we would have no hesitation to recommend it to anyone.

<Content>What a little gem of a hotel! We have stayed in Amsterdam many times before, at a wide variety of hotels, but this was our first stay at the Nadia .....and it won't be our last! From the very onset of our stay, the hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly and really couldn't do more for us. We arrived early so our room wasn't ready but the Nadia is more than happy to look after your belongings until your room is available. Be advised, like many hotels in Amsterdam, the Nadia has very steep stairs and no lift, but once again the hotel staff insist on carrying your cases up and down any stairs for you, making life much easier. Remember to leave your cases at the bottom of the stairs when you first arrive (reception is on the first floor) and they will collect them for you.The hotel is very well situated. It is directly across the street from Westekerk (near Anne Frank's house) and trams stop there regularly throughout the day (although Amsterdam is best experienced by foot - there are some great finds down the little side streets) It is a few minutes walk to some of the best shopping areas in the city.Our modest room was very clean, comfortable and had everything we would need for our three night stay. Breakfast (breads cheese, cakes, croissants, yoghurt, juice and tea or coffee) takes place in a lovely balcony breakfast room where again the staff are very helpful and friendly. We celebrated our first wedding anniversary while we were there and the staff left a beautiful bouquet of flowers for us - we believe it is the touches like this that make a hotel stand out amongst the rest and helped to make our stay so enjoyable. When we next plan a visit to Amsterdam we will phone the hotel directly for their special deals as advised by the hotel staff. A lovely hotel and great value for money.

Yes, the rooms are very compact but they are very clean and have all the usual facilities and the location is great - just a stone's throw from the Anne Frank House and a few minutes walk from Dam square. The staff were extrememly friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them. For the location and service the hotel is excellent value.

<Content>cosy spot Good, central location. Cosy room , excellent shower. Clean. Secure. Welcoming staff, especially kind to our child. Great coffee, good breakfast....a long wait for croissants at times. Some traffic noise at the front and single-glazed windows do not provide sound-proofing and are thermally inefficient. Very nice touch - bouquet of flowers sent to room on arrival, usually unheard of in a 2 star hotel. No hassle exit, kept luggage in room until we needed to leave town after check-out. Would consider returning.

<Content>Great Hotel!! Friendly attentive and clean This was the greatest hotel... the rooms were very small but well set up so that you had the feeling that they were larger. The rooms themselves were nicely decorated... we had a room with a balcony which is a must in Amsterdam! The staff could not have been friendlier and they were attentive to our every need... There was construction outside and they offered to switch us to another room (it was not really that much of a bother so we stayed) Overall I could not have been happier and I will stay here every time I come to Amsterdam.. Hotel Nadia I love you! I will be back soon.

<Content>querky hotel - love the stairs On arrival at the door way under the arcade I pressed the door entry buzzer, and the door lock was released, we started to walk up the stairs, an oh boy were they steep - but then it was a traditional Amsterdam building and I knew it would have steep stairs - it was one of the reasons we choose to stay there. A lovely surprise was the bouquet of fresh flowers in the room. The shower room was very economical with space, but all aspects, shower, toilet and sink were in working order and clean. Will definately stay there again.

<Content>recommended 100% 5 mins from central station, 鈧?7.50 taxi fare from station, 5 mins from dam square, ticks all the right boxes, i would have qualms about stopping here again the next time i'm in amsterdam, the hotel was run by friendly staff and the rooms where cleaned daily, rooms where reasonably priced and comfortable, if your considering stopping then you have no worries that you will be dissapointed.

We just arrived home to Denmark from a 3 night stay at the hotel Nadia.It was very good and the location was central, we had a good canal view - we stayed in a deluxe twin bed room. The staff there was so great and extremely helpful. loved the flowers there was in the room on arrival.Even though the room was a bit small , it was charming and had everything we needed.Very good value for money and we will definately come back another time.Best regards Steen and Tina

<Content>A room with a canal view Located within 10 minutes walking distance of the Dam this quaint hotel offered us comfort and ambience. After roaming along the canals for hours it was such a relief to get back to our room. Here, we could could relax on our beds and watch the passing traffic. Boats, small and large, old and new, slid pass our window along the Keizers Gracht canal while bikes with odd attachments to carry kids or shopping plied the canal roadsides.Our room was clean, adequate in size, beds slightly narrow but comfortable with a bar fridge and coffee/tea making facilities which we did not have in most hotels in Germany, Switzerland and France. A substantial continental breakfast was included - cheeses, meats, jams, bread, toast, coffee, tea. We ate in a breakfast room high above the street with views to the canal. The staff were friendly and helpful. Nadia is located across the canal from the Westerkerk where a carillon rings every 15 minutes. We did have ear plugs but we liked the sound and it seemed to merge into the background after a day or so. We stayed for 7 nights. The cost of a room with a canal view is extra and you need to request this when booking.

<Content>Solid hotel, great location Hotel Nadia is an excellent hotel in the heart of Amsterdam, right around the corner from the Anne Frank House and within walking distance of numeruos sights including Dam Square, the RLD, Centraal Station, and countless shops and restaurants. I booked one of the doubles that comes with a balcony. Free wireless was also a definite plus. I booked my stay for 6 nights through the hotel directly and they respond very quickly. Note that they normally offer a 6% discount if you pay in cash. My rate was around 670E for 6 nights so a great price for the location and service.The onyl drawback is the size of the rooms, but a visitor should use the same mentality as in New York City...if you are spending that much time in your hotel room that the size of the room becomes an issue, you are not having a good vacation.In the end, safe, clean and amazingly reasonably priced hotel in the heart of Amsterdam. Can't be beat.Note that at the moment there's scaffolding and a large screen on the canal side...not sure how much of an effect this has but for balconies on the street side there was no noticeable difference as there is no screen.

<Content>Great staff, good value With the exchange rate what it is for us Americans, I was really looking for a good value, and got it at Hotel Nadia. And the staff is very friendly. As you'd expect, the rooms are nothing fancy, but provided a good sleep. I asked for a quiet room, and got it ! Much quieter than expected, given the buzz of the city, cable cars, etc. I liked that the rooms have a frig, TV, safe, and remodeled bathrooms. However, the shower head spray in room 518 is a bit interesting / difficult --- No complaints at all on the WC in the first night's room. (we started and ended our trip with 1-night in Amsterdam); As you have probably already read, there is no elevator. The staff helps with the bags, thank goodness. Please know for older people or those who are not active at all, the stairs can be tiring -- We were on the top floor; that's 73 curvy steps up. At 40 yrs old, I'm glad that I was hitting the gym, before the trip ! Of course there are rooms on lower levels, but still more stairs than one typically climbs in the U.S. It's hard for me to rate it, as my only other hotel experience (over the past 8-yrs) has been at a much more expensive hotel. For this category of hotel, I recommend Hotel Nadia to anyone looking for a value in my favorite city.

<Content>Unbelievably friendly staff - highly recommend Excellent hotel - service beyond our wildest dreams. Osam and his staff was really friendly, helpful and accommodating. They treated our children like royalty for our short stay, and we really appreciate that. The steps up to reception look daunting, but it adds to the authenticity of the building in my view. The only downside was the weather, and I can't blame the hotel for that!!!

<Content>Compact but cosy The hotels website is a little misleading as the pictures seem to have been taken with a special magnifying lens which makes the rooms appear a lot bigger. So as you can imagine we were a little disappointed with the room size, particularly the shower room which was tiny. However the hotel was clean and the staff were really friendly and helpful all week. The location was excellent - right by the main square. Overall the hotel was lovely and the staff were welcoming - I would definitely recommend to fellow travellers.

<Content>small hotel great stay This is a small boutique hotel a ten minute walk from the central station. Location is good, exept for a bit of noice from the tram and traffic. Lots of steep stairs, but no problem if in average shape. Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff that made us feel very welcome. Small rooms, but the room and bathroom was in good condition. Overall, a lot better than what you would expect from a 2 * hotel.

The room we stayed in was a little on the small side but it had everything it said it had and a great little balcony overlooking the canal. Were already talking about going back at Easter 09 and will hopefully be staying at hotel Nadia.

<Content>A great place to stay Stayed at the Hotel Nadia for 2 nights before leaving on a cruise from Amsterdam this past May. A perfect place to stay, and the perfect location--central to everything. The Hotel staff were pleasant and most accommodating. We had a small but very clean room with a balcony--couldn't ask for more. A very enjoyable experience. Flowers were sent to our room after the staff learned when we were checking in that it was my husbands birthday. What a nice touch!

<Content>The best kept secret in Amsterdam! My husband and I stayed at the Nadia Hotel for 4 days prior to our African Safari in Tanzania and 2 days on our return, this past September, 2008.The staff at the hotel is very friendly, caring and helpful , especially Michelle and Tess. Upon our arrival we were surprised to have a lovely welcome vase of flowers in our room! On our return visit, a welcome back home vase of flowers was there to greet us. Free bottled water was available whenever it was needed. This hotel is a gem with lovely rooms canalside.I highly recommend Nadia Hotel and know your stay will be very pleasant.Olivia Evans

<Content>Adorable hotel in an Amazing city It was our first time to Amsterdam and we definately picked a perfect hotel! It was very central, a close walk to everywhere, but still very quiet. We had a corner room on the top floor, so we could see over the river and the church in front of Anne Frank's house. The staff at the hotel were very friendly, polite and helpful. They offered us refreshments from the fridge almost every time we came through. As well, they remembered which room we were staying in and had our key ready by the time we got to the office. They also let us use their own computer to checkin for our flight home.The breakfast was ok, the room was quite crowded but had a nice view. The room was quite large and very unique. We loved it from the minute we walked in. One of the most charming hotels we've stayed in. The only complaint I have is how uncomfortable the beds are. For that price, I truly believe the hotel should upgrade the beds. Then it will easily be a 4* stay. The stairs were not a problem for us, even after walking around Amsterdam all day.All in all, it was a wonderful stay and we will definately consider staying there again. Amsterdam was an amazing city too and we can't wait to get back!

<Content>Central location, polite staff but equipment needs a refreshing The hotel has a very central location, which is very convenient for touring around the city. The staff is very helpful and polite. However, the rooms and the bathroom are really small and the towels and the bath curtain surely need to be changed with new ones. For the price we paid (over 100 euro per night), we surely expected more. Also, if you are disabled or elderly person, or with kids, this hotel is not for you because the stairs are very tough and there is no lift. Anyway, given the overpriced hotels in Amsterdam and the overall impression from previous visitors' remarks about the tininess of most hotels there, this one can do a job for a night or two.

<Content>Hotel Nadia - klein aber fein - immer wieder gern The first impression was that the hotel is pretty small - but really nice and typically for Amsterdam. Situated in the centre of Amsterdam you can walk around in the city and visit all the nice shopping streets and sights. Staff is very nice and if you need recommandations for shopping or something else just ask the nice guys at the reception. You can enjoy the lovely breakfast in a nice breakfast room. Rooms are rather small but everything is super-clean!!!!

<Content>Friendly, central hotel Nice, friendly, smallish, fairly cheap, central hotel. Clean  good value for money. Rooms a bit small but very convenient for most of the tourist attractions in the area. Friendly  helpful staff. Near to Anne Frank House and Dam Square, and a 10-15 minute walk to Central Station. Lots of stairs and no lift so may not be suitable for people with disabilities (although this is the same for many buildings in Amsterdam). Continental breakfast included.

<Content>Loved the Customer Service and Location If you are looking for a great location, and the best customer service money can buy, you must stay at the Hotel Nadia. Upon our arrival, I realized that the stairs were a little to steep for me and my husband. Osam, the Manager of the Hotel Nadia, immediately changed the location of our room. Throughout our visit, we had several other requests that were handled with a smile and can do attitude. In addition, the rooms were very clean and well kept. Breakfast was plentiful and was served in the most charming breakfast room overlooking the city. If you ever have the opportunity, and good fortune to visit this charming city, I highly recommend the Hotel Nadia. You will not be disappointed.Mae  Richard, Los Angeles, California

<Content>a very nice stay When we first arribed to the hotel (which we easily found, Holland is really good indicated, not as Spain) we couldn't believe the stairs. We knew there were terrible stairs there (because we came with the recomendation of my brother who stayed here a year before), nevertheless, we'd never seen such high steps (but during the week, we saw this kind of steps are everywhere in Amsterdam). However, the staff are so nice they carried our luggagge up at the moment we arribed. The breakfast is good, I falled in love with the breakfast room and its views. The rooms are confortable and the cleaning is very good.I'd like to thank the staff of the hotel because they were very nice and hepled us by telling how to get to everywhere!

<Content>Well recommended for a 2-star hotel - can't wait to go back ! Just had 3 nights with the wife at the Nadia and loved it.The hotel is very well situated for eveything really, just a short walk to Dam Square, The Jordaan, Anne Frank House, RLD, Spui square etc. Trams run directly outside the hotel and also just out of the hotel to the right for trams towards the museums and Leidseplein.The hotel itself is excellent for a 2 star rated hotel.The rooms are small, but we expected that and booked a room with a balcony so we could sit out with a coffee. I would recommend this, it's not that much extra.As has been said previously, the stairs are very steep, but the staff do carry your luggage up and down for you. We were also able to leave our bags when we arrived early in the morning and they were delivered to our room when we checked in later.Breakfast is included, which was fine for our purposes - a coffee and juice and maybe a croissant just to set us up for our next day out round Amsterdam. However, for me, the best thing about the hotel was the friendliness and hospitality of the staff. They were unfailingly cheerful, polite and helpful. On the morning of our departure the gentleman on reception even went and set up the breakfast room an hour early so we could have something to eat before leaving.We will be back next time we visit Amsterdam.

<Content>A Wonderful Place to Stay I was with a group of five couples that stayed at Hotel Nadia in early August 2008. We all loved the hotel. It is not for everyone but if you are looking for a well-located, clean, friendly place to stay, this is for you. If you have trouble climbing stairs you would be better off going someplace else as the stairs are steep and there is no elevator. The rooms are small but clean. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. I don't think any of us have ever been to a friendlier hotel. The rooms are small but have everything you need. We were there for two days before a cruise and had decided to put what we thought we would need for our Amsterdam stay in our overnight bags. That turned out to be a very good idea because of the small rooms. We stored the larger suitcase. We wanted to find a good, clean hotel that was well-located so that we could walk or take the tram and this was the perfect hotel for that. We also wanted something that was what we call a local type hotel and not something that was just like at home. Hotel Nadia was perfect and exceeded our expectations. We loved everything about it.

<Content>Even better second time around Its the second time I have stayed at Hotel Nadia and I very much hope it won't be my last.I had a lovely stay, I was well looked after by all the staff.The hotel is ideally situated next to all the major attractions and only a short walk from the station.The hotel itself is small, however there is everything and more that you could possible need. The rooms are very clean and tidy, theres a good sized fridge, tea and coffee facilities, beds are very comfy. There is a safe in the room, however you probably don't have to use it as the security in the hotel is extremely good as the front door is always locked and you need to buzz your way in each time.The hotel dosn't allow noisy stag holiday makers which is good as Amsterdam has plenty of those, so you won't be woken up at 3 in the morning by a gang of drunken men. I suppose if you want a really quiet night sleep then you may want to ask for a room away from the main street.Overall a really brilliant stay and I look forward to going back again sometime next year.

<Content>Noisy Rooms We were given a room at the front of the hotel and the noise from the traffic was horrendous for 24 hours of the day. The noise made a good night's sleep impossible and the lack of sleep significantly affected our stay in Amsterdam.The rooms really are very small indeed, but our room was clean. The staff are extremely friendly and most helpful, but light sleepers beware!

<Content>We liked Nadia We have just returned from a few days stay at Amsterdam Nadia hotel. It was family travel: me, my husband, two children and baby. The hotel stuff was great. At the moment we arrived they offered us cold drinks and sweets, chidred were excited of that. Also they recomended us the hot spots of the city, they know all about the transport traffic, working hours and even the weather prognose. Exept the climbing numerous steps at the hotel, we were happy during all the stay at the hotel. It was not expensive, bet very cute, very well located, also family friendly. Thanks the working stuff for our pleasant experience staying in Amsterdam.

<Content>Hotel Nadia - A Hidden Gem The hotel was perfectly situated for our needs It is on several bus/trolley lines and is within walking distance to many churches and museums on our list. There were lots of restaurants close by plus stores and stores and stores.The hotel is located above shops and the stairs are extremely steep so it is not the best place for babies or small children and individuals not able to climb a steep staircase. They do not have an elevator but do offer to have your bags brought to your room.Our room was a typical small hotel room - and we managed quite nicely once we realized just how much space we had. Luickly they had planned well and one wall held numerous shelves which made it quite easy to live out of our suit cases and still have lots of space to put stuff we used often (cameras, backpacks, etc.)The hotel is very clean and the staff is delightful and most helpful. Breakfasts were great and the dining room is so pleasant with many hanging plants and flowers decorating the room.We felt that the hotel is a hidden gem because from the street you would have no idea that it even existed a floor above the shops.

<Content>"The" hotel you want to stay in. This is simply one of the best hotels available in Amsterdam for its price range.My girlfriend and I stayed for 2 nights in Amsterdam at hotel Nadia and after hearing nothing but horror stories about the accommodation from friends who have travelled there before we did a lot of research and decided to stay in this hotel and it was a good choice.From the moment we arrived, the staff where as helpful as possible and carried all our bags up to our room and got us sorted out with maps and information.We stayed on the top floor in a lovely room with a private balcony overlooking 2 streets and a canal. The room was clean, comfortable and decorated in a lovely traditional manner.At night the room was quiet and breakfast the following morning was excellent.The hotel is easy walking distance from the main train station and the dam is a quick stroll away so the cities nightlife is only a few minutes away.We will defiantly stay here again.

<Content>Great value Pro's- Nadia has a great central location, tram stop is in front of the hotel. it's a short two minute walk to the Anne Frank house and a 10 minute walk to the square. Excellent customer service. We arrived early after an overnight flight and they went the extra mile to get us into a room right away. Room was clean and comfortable for two- had a deluxe canal view room. Secure- have to buzz to get in the hotel. Overall an excellent value and you won't find better attention to your needs anywhere else in Amsterdam.Con's- none really. Yes, the stairs are steep so if you have issues with this please take it seriously. Breakfast was good- not great. and there is a very good pancake house right next door.Overall: I would no doubt stay with Nadia again

<Content>Fantastic location, immaculately clean, tiny room! We stayed here for two nights last weekend. It's a funny looking place, accessed from a door on the street where you scale a mountain-like staircase to the reception. The welcome is super friendly, highly organised and we were checked-in and out on the town within ten minutes. We were also offered free drinks on arrival - nice touch. The room though was absolutely tiny. Bed pushed up against the wall and the smallest bathroom I have ever experienced. However everything worked and there were carefully thought-out features like hooks on the doors, shelves where there's no space for a bedside cabinet etc. The weather was extremely hot and the hotel has no AC but this was not a problem. It's an old, naturally cool hotel and the room was also kitted-out with a fan. We were also plagued by mosquitos on the first night - annoying but not really the fault of the hotel. Breakfast is included but hardly worth bothering with. Average coffee, juice and a mediocre selection of soggy croissants, bread rolls, cheese and preserves are all that's offered. The breakfast room is also ridiculously small!All-in-all I would recommend this place even though it's quite expensive for the facilities offered.

<Content>Delightful gem We travelled to Amsterdam to see our son perform with the Halle Youth Orchestra at a lunchtime concert in the Westerkerk. The Nadia is a charming hotel, occupying the end part of a very historic building. The location is absolutely fantastic, with the Westerkerk opposite, Anne Frank's house around the corner and the stop for the Canalbus just over the road. We had read about the friendly staff before we arrived and were not disappointed. Nothing is too much trouble for this family. They are welcoming, provide valuable tourist information and go the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. It is true that the rooms are snug - my husband felt that he was in the cabin on a ship! Everything is there to hand though - tv, fridge, fan and a safety deposit box, which is invaluable in a city hotel. Everything is perfectly kept, with fresh towels daily. The owners seem to know exactly what makes a difference to customers and the service reflects that. Breakfasts were good, with fresh juice and the usual continental fayre. The dining room is in period style, with lots of plants and fresh flowers. It too is tiny for the number of rooms, but seems to be able to accommodate the people it serves and we never had to wait on the three days of our stay. What is not to like about the Nadia? The only problem could be the stairs for the less mobile. They are certainly a challenge, but help to burn off the calories and are good exercise! Staff anticipate difficulties and carry bags etc., so the only thing you have to worry about is yourself. This is Amsterdam and the Nadia reflects the typical style of the buildings! We had a lovely stay, would definitely stay here again and will recommend the Nadia to our friends.

<Content>Hotel Nadia - great for family with teenagers We stayed two nights at Hotel Nadia with our three teenage children plus one girlfriend. We found it great particularly the location near Anne Frank House but also the character (loved the long, steep stairs) and the friendliness/helpfulness of the staff. Nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are 'cosy' though and there is some street noise. But it was perfect for our purposes.

<Content>Nadia Hotel The Nadia provided a welcoming, safe and friendl;y stay. They were able to store my bicycle, and were flexible and helpful during our stay.An excellent service, both from Osam and all the staff, reception, catering and cleaning .Highly recommended as a good value hotel near to central Amsterdam, with canal views and a genuine family-style service.David.

<Content>a great Amsterdam Hotel I stayed for three nights in Hotel Nadia. I am Dutch, I know Amsterdam and I can tell you that this was a great hotel.Very helpful when checking in. They will bring your luggage to your room. With the steep stairs, you will be gratefull!!The breakfast, which is included, is so delightfully dutch.The location is ideal, at the Keizers Gracht en Wester Toren, you can walk everywhere and the Tram stops are almost in front of the hotel.If your budget is not for the Pullitzer Hotel, which is not a dutch experience, the Nadia Hotel I can highly recommend.The owner of the hotel was so helpful and kind, it added to a great stay in Amsterdam. And next year I definately plan to return to Nadia Hotel.

<Content>Two days in Amsterdam We had a great stay at the Nadia Hotel. The staff were very welcoming and when we arrived early it was great to be able to leave our bags in a safe place while we looked around Amsterdam. Our bags were waiting for us in our room when we got back.We found it very awkward that we only had one key for our room but two doors to go through (one door to go into the corridor, then our room door) , this meant that the three of us had to go everywhere together otherwise we couldnt get into the room.The room was very clean and had everything we needed.Our only problem was that it was a bit noisy due to being at the front of the hotel, the next time I would ask for a room away from the main road. Breakfast was good, plenty of bread, cheese, jam etc and hot drinks. We made good use of the maps and information brochures that were available at the reception desk. The hotel is in a very central position,so we could walk to most places, but we could have taken the tram or bus as they were just outside.

<Content>Cute and Cosy Hotel Nadia is in a great location close to a canal. It's quite central and all of the tourist attractions were within walking distance. The staff were friendly and helpful. It was one of the few hotels that acknowledged that we were on our honeymoon by leaving a lovely bunch of flowers in our room. The rooms are small but adequate.The stairs are very long, steep and narrow ( not for the faint hearted! ) However, the staff are happy to help you with your baggage and they offered us a complimentary drink on arrival.

<Content>Hotel Nadia: Lovely staff  We stayed 5 nights at the Hotel Nadia and had a lovely time.The location is very central, just a few minutes from Dam Square, not far (short walk) to most main areas and quite near the Jordaan district with its lovely shops, restaurants,  cafes, but far enough away from the late night noisy city-centre activity. The staff were lovely, exceedingly friendly  helpful. The rooms are small and the stairs are steep so be prepared, but this is a traditional Dutch building and is part of the charm and there's so much to do in Amsterdam how much time do you want to spend in your hotel room? You're provided with a free drink on arrival and any suitcases are carried to room so you don't need to struggle up the stairs with them yourself.There's no air conditioning, but electric fans are provided and putting the fan on with the window open made the room perfectly comfortable even on a hot summer night.It's an easy to walk to the central station but if you have luggage the tram stops is very close by.Breakfast is served until 10 and if that's too early for you, there are some lovely cafes for yummy Dutch pancakes very close by. You can leave your luggage safely in their secure luggage room after you've check out, which if you have a late flight means you can enjoy your last day without having to carry all your luggage with you.We will certainly stay there again.

<Content>Great Service and Location I have stayed at Hotel Nadia twice now and enjoyed my stay each time. The owner is very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect for access to all attractions. The rooms are typical Dutch, small but cozy. Free wifi is also a plus since most hotels make you pay and it is expensive. I highly recommed Hotel Nadia. It is a great value for the price.

<Content>Much better than expected! I was worried, having never been to Amsterdam and staying in a lowly rated hotel, but the reviews from the travelers were good. I always trust fellow travelers over travel critics. I was pleasantly surprised when we got there, we got there way before check-in and they held our bags for us so that we didn't have to walk around the city with them and offered us complimentary breakfast even though we weren't checked in yet. The staff was amazingly friendly, everyone was very nice and gave us recommendations of places to go. The rooms were small with a tv, minifridge, and a private bathroom. They had the most amazing windows, I loved sitting on the window sill just watching the city in motion. The free breakfast was great and in a cute little room. The best part was the location. It was within walking distance of most places. If you are looking for a five-star hotel this isn't it, but if you are looking for a clean, safe, convenient, cheap hotel this is the pick!Warning: If stairs are a problem for you, don't stay here. Depending on you floor you will easily be required to climb at least 100 steps if not more.

<Content>An interesting, quirky, very friendly little hotel. Great location PositivesThe location of this hotel is perfect. 100 yards from Anne Frank's house and on the edge of the beautiful Jordaan area. Also only 5 minute walk down to the Dam.Really friendly staff, who thankfully carried our bags up and down the stairs, remembered our names and provided us with plenty of free drinks.NegativesWe had a deluxe room and it was quite small, pretty basic and the smallest single bed I have ever slept in (since I was about 5 anyway). Breakfast not overly exciting, but there is a great pancake shop below the hotel which I would recommend.The stairs are very steep (as I suspect is the case with many hotels in Amsterdam), no lift, not really a problem for us but would be if you had young children or weren't too mobile.Overall a nice little hotel, very clean, very friendly. I would def stay here again as it's a great location and the staff are so friendly. Rooms are a little quirky and small so don't expect too much but it is definitely value for money.

<Content>Another great stay at the Nadia Reviewer: Geordie Northumberland UKDate: 8 July 2008Having stayed at Hotel Nadia for each of the last 4 years (most recently at the end of June) I would strongly recommend it to others - I visit Amsterdam quite regularly (and have done for almost 30 years) and no longer consider staying anywhere else!The biggest selling point of this hotel is actually the manager and staff - all of them are extremely friendly, courteous and helpful - they really make you feel very much at home throughout your stay.I always use the hotel website to make my reservation and find it a stress free experience as e mail enquiries and reservations are answered quickly and effectively.Anyone preferring a delux room (with great canal views) or balcony room should book early as these are usually snapped up well in advance.Hotel Nadia is in an excellent location and well within walking distance of many of the most popular visitor sights and attractions. The Jordaan district (my favourite area of the city) is only a few minutes walk away.It is a great value for money hotel - hence my high rating. I only wish that I was just about to arrive rather than having just returned from another great weekend stay.

<Content>Great location and place to rest your head Stayed here for 3 nights after looking widely for a good place to stay in central Amsterdam but without breaking the bank. The Nadia fitted the requirements exactly. Located just 5 mins from Dam Square but away from the hustel and bustle late at night. 10 - 15 mins walk to all main areas and easily found from central station. I walked it as only had small case on wheeels, but if heavy luggage - take a tram.Stairs are steep, but we were ready! Great welcome, free drink on arrival, cases carried to room... Room was small by comparison to some but again we were pleasantly surprised after reading about the rooms on here. Very clean, view of canal, small balcony, powerful shower (bathroom small but was fine), free wi fi, TV, kellte and coffee in room - all in all if its just a bed you want - why pay more? Also, everytime we came back, we were offered a drink from the fridge in reception.Breakfast was basic, bread, croissant, coffee etc. but again was fine for usStaff very friendly and helpful.Can leave luggage securely after check out.Would certainly stay there again

<Content>Loved the Nadia! The Nadia is a great little hotel on the Radhuisstraat, right near the Anne Frank House and right near the center of Centrum - a perfect location to have a home base for exploration of Amsterdam's historic center. The hotel is very comfortable, and the staff is superb - friendly and efficient. Osam, the manager, is a wonderful man - very kind, helpful and eager to make sure your needs are met. A top notch choice of hotel that belies its two-star status. A real treat!

<Content>"Okay" hotel From what I read on the website, I expected the room to be better. We stayed at the Nadia for 3 nights at the end of a 4 city tour in Europe. Compared to the other hotels we stayed in, which were all in the same price range (although in different cities), I thought the Nadia was the least enjoyable. As others have mentioned, the rooms were small; we had a real hard time even trying to find places to lie down our suitcases. We resorted to moving the chairs from under the desk and placing our cases below the desk. The room didn't appear as clean as I would have liked. The drapes appeared dirty and I noticed holes in the bed linens. On the positive side, the location was nice and close to main attractions and the staff was very friendly and helpful. If I return to Amsterdam, I would look into other hotels before re-booking at the Nadia.

<Content>A++ Hotel Great hotel. I was looking for a quad room, reasonably price and a good location. The Nadia meet all my requirements. The room was a decent size with a private bath, refrigerator and a canal view. It wasn't fancy but was clean and comfortable. The staff is outstanding and very friendly and helpful. I had to book this room directly with the hotel. The internet travel sites I used did not offer an option for a quad room. I contacted the hotel directly and submitted a request for a quad room and the dates I wanted. They responded very quickly with a room rate. The hotel is in a great location - within walking distance of the Anne Frank house. The entryway has very steep stairs to climb and if you have trouble walking or climbing this hotel is not for you. Luckily the staff carries your luggage to your room for you! The location is great but it can be a little noisy because the hotel is located on a main road. One night I had to wear my ear plugs but the Dutch had just won a World Cup match and cars honked their horns and people partied until early morning! I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would highly reommend it.

<Content>Loved the Nadia I have just come back from staying at the Nadia Hotel for two nights with my husband. I really can't fault it. Our room was lovely and clean with a beautiful view over the canal and city below. The shower room was small, but was spotless and the shower was really powerful. The location was perfect - very central to all attractions and for the money, I was very impressed. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful and although the stairs are a bit daunting, they really weren't a problem for us. The breakfast room is a lot smaller than it looks on the website, but again it didn't cause any problems in the mornings.We are hoping to return to Amsterdam next year and would certainly stay at the Nadia again.

<Content>Good budget hotel and friendly staff The Nadia, is a good budget hotel. Ignore the bad comments from other people - they clearly only make complaints and would not dream of writing a good report. As other reviewers have said, the rooms are small, which is the norm in Europe. The manager and staff are great and friendly and most importantly the hotel is clean. If you plan on sitting in your room for most of your stay while in Amsterdam then stay elsewhere, but if you want a good, clean hotel to be used as a place to sleep/base while exploring the city then you can't go wrong with the Nadia.My only criticism is that the bathrooms were a bit too small but again it did the job.

<Content>love tour The hotel is in an excellent position because it's near the centre, the station and the most famous Amsterdam's monuments. The owners of the Nadia hotel are very friendly and expert, but the breakfast should be more various and bigger. Amsterdam is a beautiful city with good services and the Nadia hotel is a good place to stay. P.S: sorry for our bad english.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel, friendlly staff, great location  We were in a triple room for 2 nights. There was nothing that you can fault in this lovely hotel. We arrived early on the Saturday morning and were welcomed into the hotel and invited for a lovely complimentary breakfast and coffee. Our bags were moved into our room when we were able to officially check in. Breakfast is simple and delicious. There was plenty food and staff kept bringing more out. The breakfast room is quaint and cosy - a lovely way to start your day. The rooms were extremely clean and well serviced. Each room has a private bathroom. The shower has great water pressure and a proper shower door 鈥?thus there is no mucky shower curtain to cope with!Beds sleep well and have lovely white sheets and duvets - no old blankets that get used for each guest. Good quality tea and coffee in your room and is filled up every morning. Should you require more - simply ask at the breakfast area and nothing is too much trouble. Each time we went to drop our key at reception - we were invited to take a complimentary cold drink / bottled water. Finer details like these make a really good impression on guests and instantly make you feel at home. We walked every where from the hotel. It is close to all the sights and is walking distance from the main station. It is on the tram routes 鈥?however we never used the trams as Amsterdam is lovely to walk though. I would highly recommend this hotel for the average traveller. It is more than a budget hotel and falls in the budget price range. Treat yourself to a stunning stay at Hotel Nadia.

<Content>Location Location Location! I just returned from my 4 night stay at the Hotel Nadia and I would recommend for those of you going to Amsterdam for a short trip of a couple of days, not for a long-term stay. The hotel team was extremely welcoming, nice, helpful, and funny. The location cannot be beat. It is central to everything. No need to take a cab from Central Station since it's (literally) a 5 minute tram ride with the tram stopping on the same street as the hotel. With the current exchange rate between the dollar and the euro, this is a great bargain. Hotel is very clean and has all the amenities a person from the USA is used to.But be forewarned that the room I had was small. I'm used to small, but this was really small. Thank god I had a room with a balcony (which I highly recommend). And the bed I had was lumpy, but was able to sleep once I found the perfect spot to sleep on.Overall, I would recommend this hotel and actually stay here again for any future visits to Amsterdam. :0)

<Content>Excellent staff What really makes this hotel stand out is the people at the front desk who are very helpful and the manager, who is extremely helpful as well. They went out of their way to help me contact my daughter who was delayed and could not call me because my cellphone was not working. they were also very nice about getting me into my room fairly soon after arrival even though I arrived quire early. I really can't say enough about them. the location is extremely convenient. We walked to and from the train stations and to the museums. the stairs are quite steep. I was unprepared for this, but the staff carries the luggage so it is no problem except for people with physical limitations. The room was rather small, as is typical in European cities, but very clean and comfortable.

<Content>Friendly, clean but not for everyone I stayed in a single room (with balcony) for 3 nights while on business in Amsterdam. Everything was spotless; there was good linen on the bed (2 single beds in my room) and good towels in the very tiny bathroom. I am used to the high price to quality ratio in hotels in Europe's major cities so was not surprised by the rather cramped quarters but felt I could have done better. The door to the room, for example, bumped the table when opened so couldn't open fully and the door to the bathroom was more like half a door, requiring me to turn sideways to get thru (and I'm thin). The stairs up to reception were, as others have mentioned, extremely steep and it felt like mountaineering to climb them. Friends staying in an apartment in Amsterdam had a similar situation so this is common in these old narrow buildings but I've noticed that some small hotels do have lifts.. The Nadia staff carry your luggage up  down but be aware that this hotel is not for everyone for these reasons. Extremely friendly staff on the reception and, like almost everyone in Amsterdam, they spoke excellent English. There was a long wait before I could get into my room which was irritating as I had business to do. I was invited to sit in the tiny breakfast room while, presumably, someone made the room ready. Not sure about this - it was never explained. As this was mid afternoon, I felt this was a slip-up on the hotel's part.Breakfast was fairly basic but included in the room rate so I can't really complain about that. You couldn't expect breakfast in this standard of hotel to be lavish.I did not particularly like the area in which the hotel was situated but I'd be hard pressed to say which would be a better area (except perhaps further into the Jordaan area?) In my opinion Amsterdam is a scruffy city and the charm of the canals is tempered by the amount of litter, graffiti, and the general down-at-heel look of the place and the people (inhabitants and visitors!). Just my opinion after a year of quite extensive travelling in Europe... and I thought the same when I was last in Amsterdam about 20 years ago. My husband and I are planning to return for a couple of days in October to catch up with friends from Australia who will be ending a Danube cruise there and I will be looking for another hotel. I don't want to be hard on the Nadia which is OK for its price bracket but I know that, with my husband in tow, we will need to move up a notch for him to be happy. We both like the old style of architecture and fairly small hotels so I am considering some of the other suggestions in trip advisor reviews such as Hotel Brouwer and Hotel Fita.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel - Fabulous Stay This was our second visit to Amsterdam and our first stay at the Hotel Nadia. Its location is perfect 鈥?everything you want is so near and it offers great canal views.We were very much looking for a true Netherlands experience and found exactly that at the Nadia. We were lucky to be upgraded to a brilliant room (with balcony) with magnificent views of the canal and City . The staff and management were genuinely warm, friendly and helpful 鈥?right from when we booked (over the internet) and throughout our stay.Yes the stairs are steep but that is all part of the hotel鈥檚 charm and the 24 hour security is excellent.A continental style, self service breakfast was included in the price and what was on offer was tasty and served with good coffee.Staying at the Hotel Nadia was a great experience for us - we would definitely return and recommend it to others. The Hotel and its staff really made our stay!Donna and David, Perth - Western Australia

<Content>Great service I had read a lot about this hotel on tripadvisor and had certain expectations. I was not disappointed. The hotel it self could be a standard Amsterdam BB. I have stayed in similar hotels there and know what to expect for the price range, which is a clean comfortable, tiny room with basic amenities. However this hotel is all about the little things that the staff do to make your stay pleasant. They generally seem to be interested in making your stay comfortable without seeming fake.A few days before I was due to arrive I emailed the hotel with a query and they actually called me on my mobile phone to respond. When we arrived early, they assisted with carrying our bags up the mountain (which is the traditionally steep stairs), they offered us free breakfast and throughout our stay they made us feel welcome without going overbroad. It was just right. I can tell they are the type of hotel that understand their various types of clientele and treat them accordingly.The only one thing I was slightly disappointed in was the lack of variety offered for breakfast. I stayed at a similar hotel a few doors down from the Nadia, and they had a wider variety including ham cheese, boiled egg and a toaster for bread. The breakfast at Nadia was even more basic consisting of croissants, rolls and bread (no toaster). By no means did this ruin our excellent stay, I was just expecting more as I had something to compare it to.I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting for a few days and do not want to splash out. It is by far the best in its category

<Content>Great location  Staying at the Hotel Nadia was a great experience for us. The staff couldn't be more accomodating - they will insist on making the check in and check out process easy. There are steep stairs up to the check in desk, but for a true Netherlands experience, the steep stairs are worth it. The breakfast is mostly bread, coffee, and juice, but it's presented well and the breakfast room was clean. The bedroom was clean as was the bath. One of the best things about the hotel is the security - there is a buzzer to get in and the front desk is manned 24 hours. The hotel is ideally located with a great view of Westerkirk church and within easy walking distance to some worthwhile stops such as the Anne Frank House  the Theater museum.

<Content>Hotel Nadia is very good value for the money. The rooms, although small, were quite comfortable and clean. Breakfast was included in the room price and was good. The staff were most helpful, friendly and accommodating. I would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>beautiful and charming Our stay at Nadia Hotel was great and exactly what I had hoped for. I was looking for character and charm over sterile chain-like hotel. Nadia was perfect......the decor and the ambiance and location are great! The deep reds and dark wood and antique lamps and ironworks gave the place a musty romantic feel. It has character for sure! (and hotel cats!) Other reviews note the small rooms and dreadful stairs, but that was not a problem for us. I was pleasantly surprised to find that in addition to the charm, It was clean, the bed comfortable, nice towels, sheets and pillows great too. Our balcony overlooked the street/canal and was awesome. The location was great too.....right by a big church with a giant obelisk at top so wherever you were in the city, you just have to look up and follow the big blue orb and it will lead you home! The staff was very friendly and very helpful!

<Content>Very disappointing, poor value hotel I've traveled around the world and lived in many countries, and I have to say that the Nadia Hotel is one of the most disappointing experiences of my entire travel life. I booked two rooms, one for myself and one for two friends. Each room was about $225, so I expected far more than we actually got. The only way that I can describe the decor of the Nadia is that it reminded me of the many Intourist hotels that I've stayed at in the former USSR. This is not a compliment. Cheap furnishings, heavily-varnished woods, small TVs, and the worst of all -- a pervasive musty, rubbery smell. As many others have commented, the rooms are no bigger than large closets. The bathrooms are OK, but with extremely small sinks and no shelves. The breakfast was also very disappointing -- essentially various pastries, bread, one kind of cheese, juice, coffee, and tea. No eggs, no fruit, no yoghurt -- in short, nothing of distinction for the price.The staff seemed to be caring and well-meaning, but there's not much they can do to improve the experience given the overall substandard nature of the property.

<Content>Good job we weren't health and safety inspectors! We had been looking forward to our three days in Amsterdam for months, unfortunately the hotel was a let down to our holiday. First off, the room was not ready when we arrived. After returning later in the day to settle in, we were shocked to find....1) The amount of steep stairs to access the hotel2) The overall lack of cleanliness- the room was literally caked in dust, including in the cracks in the wall. You were not only looking at dust through the window, it flew around the room visibly in the sunlight! The safe was covered in dust and so was the fan, and the carpet did not look like it had been vacuumed since it has been opened. 3) The size of the room- you could not fully open the door as it hit the desk, and you couldn't even get your case through! The walkway between both beds was literally a matter of inches.4) The beds: One's mattress was larger than the base so that it pushed you out of bed and forced you onto the floor due to such worn springs. The other was literally hanging out of the window and the blanket got lost down the gap! They seemed itchy and infested- the place felt alive with bugs and no matter how long you spent in the shower, you didn't feel clean5) The breakfast consisted of cold bread, crackers, and cake. Anyone with a wheat intolerance would go hungry! No hot food was offered at all6) The bathroom was like a portacabin but smaller, with a shower which flooded and a toilet which broke during our stay7) The TV remote didn't work properly and was constantly stuck on one settingWe were always offered free drinks from the bar, almost as if the staff felt embarrassed by the hotel. We also had our picture taken with reception staff with the promise that it would be emailed to us when we returned to England. However, since being back we have received nothing and feel this is the last insult from this hotel. DEFINITELY one to avoid for all travellers who like a clean place to stay.

<Content>Good Location Stayed at the Nadia Hotel for 2 nights, very nice, clean and excellent location. You might find the rooms are very small but alot of the hotels in Amsterdam are the same. Breakfast could be abit better as all they have is bread, cheese, butter orange juice and coffee. Staff are very nice and helpful, would stay here again!!

<Content>charming nadia Me and my husband just came back from a weekend-trip in amsterdam, a wonderful, fascinating city! Our enthusiasm about our stay has also to do with the choice of our hotel: a lucky choice! hotel nadia is a charming little hotel, located in the Jordaan Quarter, one of the most beautyful quarters of Amsterdam. the room we had was not big, but quite enough for us two. we paid 260 Euro for two nights, breakfast incl. we had our own bathroom (very clean!), fridge, safe, etc. and tv (if somebody needs鈥?. we prefered the canal view (and the quitness in the nights). but above all: not only our room, the whole hotel is really pretty and tasteful furnished. the hotelmanager and his staff was very nice, always helpful, with an extraordinary kindness. we enjoyed also the two housecats, one is called 芦hello禄 and the other 芦goodbye禄. isn't that lovely? in the end: we really can recommend the hotel nadia and for us it's sure, that we will stay there again during our next visit in amsterdam!

<Content>Hotel nadia was great value in the centre of Amsterdam We stayed in Amsterdam for 3 nights at Hotel Nadia based on reviews here. A little apprehensive as we rang the bell of the tiny door in the street but our welcome was fantastic . We were a little early but were offered a cold drink, coffee as we relaxed in the breakfast room getting our first glimpse of the Amsterdam canals. The staff also insisted on carrying our bags up the stairs for us. Our room was small but very clean and perfect for our needs - it also looked out to the canal in the side street - the fridge also meant we could stock up on some food from the nearby supermarket for picnics by the canals. Breakfast was adequate - rolls, cheese, coffee, tea, croissants, juice. Perfect location with easy tram ride from station (the tram numbers are on their web site) and 5 minute walk to the main square, 10 minute walk to red light district and many restaurants and bars in between. Amsterdam is a very interesting and perhaps unique city and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We hired bikes for the day from Yellow Bike and they pointed us in the direction of the farming area by catching the ferry across the water at main train station - spent about 5 hours leisurely exploring the farms, dykes and villages. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel and its staff who continued to be extremely helpful right throughout our stay.

<Content>Great service We stayed in the Nadia on the recomendation of my daughter who had stayed there on several occasions.The basic room we had for the first 2 nights was rather small and cramped for our needs but an upgrade to a better and larger room overlooking the canal was very satisfactory.The stairs are rather daunting on first appearance,not suited for the faint hearted!!.The flowers in the rooms are a nice touch as were the complimentary soft drinks.The service was both friendly and courteous and the price not overboard.We will definately visit again.

<Content>A room with a view. Michael  PatriciaN.IrelandA lot of reviews would say you get what you pay for, in the case of the Nadia we certainly got a lot more. Our room may have been on the small side but it had everything you would need and it was spotless and had a lovely view of the canal and church also the location of the hotel was perfect for the sights of the city.Hamid in reception was a first class host along with owners they made us feel very welcome they also provided flowers for my wife on her birthday (nice one). I would recommend this hotel and hope to return. A BIG THANKYOU TO THE NADIA FOR A LOVELY STAY IN AMSTERDAM.

<Content>Nadia, the place to stay in Amsterdam The Nadia Hotel is a comfortable place in the center of Amsterdam. The staff is very professional and and a wealth of information. Everyone speaks english and are eager to help you in any way. We had the misfortune of breaking our camera and the staff suggested a place where we could buy a new one. The price was well below the tourist traps. There are two Tram stops very close to the hotel that will get you to anyplace the city. Ann Franks' museum house is a three minute walk from the front door of the hotel. There are restaurants, bars, and a coffee shop in the neighborhood. We will return to Amsterdam in the next few years and The Nadia will be our first choice.

<Content>Wonderful Place to Stay! I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. My husband and I rented a private apartment in Amsterdam and when we arrived, it was dirty  awful. I frantically emailed 5 or 6 highly-rated reasonably priced hotels and found the Nadia. From the moment we arrived, I felt at home. Although the hotel had 50 rooms, the owner and people that worked there treated us like family and sympathized with the bad experience we had had at the last place. Anything we wanted- we just had to ask. The room we had was very small, but as people checked out, we were upgraded to a larger room with a balcony and view of the canal, at no extra charge. As for the hotel itself, it was spotlessly clean. A basic but delicious breakfast was included and was served in a beautiful room overlooking the canal. The location was also perfect and was within walking distance of all the sites. We could not have found a better place!

<Content>Small but all you need We just returned yesterday (Friday 9th May) from a few days in Amsterdam which could not have been better. Weather was perfect and our Hotel (Nadia) was located ideally. Only minutes from Dam Square. In the Hotel you get what you see on their site. Room was very small but clean and with its own shower and wc was all we needed for our short stay. The Staff could not have been nicer if we were staying in the Ritz.Thank you all again.Martha Walsh Dowdall

<Content>Excellent Staff...Great Location...Tiny, but Clean Rooms I recently stayed at the Hotel Nadia for two nights, in a single and a double room. I have to say that the staff is excellent...better than most 4 or 5 star hotels. Just as everyone else has said, the stairs are steep (but manageable), the rooms are super tiny (but I was only there to sleep), and the breakfast is exactly what I expected for the price. I paid 80 euro a night and feel like the price is fair. On my second night the owner suggested that I move to another room. I was in a single on the 4th floor and my room faced the sun all day. He said a room facing the street would be much cooler...and it was! I didn't even have to ask to be moved. Everyone there was great!!! I am a female and was traveling alone. I always felt very safe and never worried about strange people in the hotel, as everyone must be buzzed in.If you're trying to save money I would suggest staying at Hotel Nadia. Just know that the rooms are small, but being steps away from everything more than makes up for it. I had a wonderful time in Amsterdam and should I ever return I will stay at Hotel Nadia! Bravo!

<Content>Hotel Nadia is wonderful! Since finding the Hotel Nadia last year, I have never considered staying anywhere else! The rooms have absolutely everything I need to either work or relax while on a business trip. I work in fashion, and do a lot of photography of clothing and jewelry. Some of the best pictures I've ever taken were on the balcony of Hotel Nadia! Even when I'm not lucky enough to get a balcony room, I really don't mind because I always have a room with large windows that open wide for fresh air, and let in lots of sunlight, which I love! The building itself is so charming and historic, I really feel like I am part of Old Amsterdam when I stay at Hotel Nadia! The staff is super friendly and attentive to my specific needs and requests. I always find the bathrooms squeaky clean and the shower very inviting after a long train ride. The beautiful breakfast room is a lovely indoor garden. It is open all day and night for guests like me who like to sit in peace and watch the water in the canal, or read a book and have some coffee. I always feel very welcome and comfortable at Hotel Nadia!

<Content>Doll house digs at down home price" The Nadia! Returned this afternoon from another delightful stay at The Nadia Hotel in Amsterdam. Received warm welcome from Osam and staff. As usual my bags were ferried up to the room by a cheerful staff member. Weather was beautiful and the room's balcony with wicker chairs was a great place to relax between trips around Amsterdam, sipping a cold drink and watching the people on the street below. On arrival you get a complimentary soft drink, and the Albert Heim market is down the block where you can stock up on juice and soft drinks to store in the room's refrigerator. I love the Nadia for it's lovely old exterior, it's quirky doll house sized rooms, elegant Victorian breakfast room, reasonable rates for a cosmopolitan city, and the very friendly staff who want guests to enjoy their stay. Holland is a country of small things, and the rooms at The Nadia are very Dutch! The value of what you get for the price is exceptional. I'll be back to stay in three weeks, and then again at Christmas.

<Content>Excellent Service, Friendly Staff I cannot fault the staff and service that we received at this hotel, everyone was so friendly and nothing was too much for them.The rooms are small but are equipped with everything you need including a fridge and reception will provide hairdryer, iron etc on request.I found the room we had to be a bit noisy as we were on the street side as we requested a balcony and it is a very busy road.Please be advised that there are steep stairs leading in to this hotel so it would not be suitable for anyone with walking difficulties but dont worry about having to drag your cases up the stairs as the staff are only too happy to do this.Overall a great stay in a reasonably priced hotel with great location (near Dam square  Anne Frank House) and only a short walk from central station.

<Content>Excellent service and location As the phrase goes, it does exactly what it says on the tin! Previous reviews were accurate: the stairs are steep and narrow, the rooms are small, but the service couldn't be better. A few people commented on how good it was to get a welcome (soft) drink on arrival. We were fortunate enough to stay during a mini-heatwave, and were offered drinks a few times on returning to the hotel.Location is superb, whether you want to walk everywhere or hop on and off the canalbus. (Highly recommended for a great way of seeing Amsterdam.) The Anne Frank House is just across the street, but beware the queues, which are very long, even first thing in the morning.Don't expect plush accomodation. That's not what you'll get at Nadia, but the rooms are cleaned every day, and the service is better than many more expensive hotels that we've stayed in!Definitely recommended as a base to see Amsterdam. Thank you everyone at Nadia!

<Content>Great stay This is the second time I have stayed at the Nadia I really don't have a bad thing to say about it, the staff are really friendly help you with anything you need rooms are clean. I've stayed in 4 stars that aren't as good. Its a 5 minute walk from the centre and is located in what I call the nice part of town. I try and visit Amsterdam every year and this is where I will be staying.

<Content>Read the reviews before you decide! We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hotel Nadia with friends - apparently we paid for a twin de-luxe room! The room was more like a corridor and there was no wardrobe or anywhere else to put clothes. My bed was pressed right up against the window, my husband was right up against a wooden partition - we had a 6 gap between the beds and it was impossible to walk in the room unless one or other of us went into the en-suite bathroom or sat on a bed. I think the room would be impossibly hot during the summer months, and we were unable to open the window except for about 1 at the top. There was a very small fan that was placed high up on a shelf and had no effect whatsoever. (A word of caution - if offered the key to room 7 have a look first before you decide). The stairs were certainly VERY steep but not too much of a problem and if I was strictly honest the plusses probably just about out-weighed the minuses. The staff were excellent, the breakfast was unexciting but adequate, the room was fairly clean and quiet, no passing traffic inside the hotel and there was not a great deal of noise from the street or canal. We are all in our 60s and I would not recommend this hotel for people who are not in reasonably good health and fitness (luckily we are!).

<Content>Love to Lounge at the Nadia I will not be able to say enough about the hotel and the staff. Travelling from Nova Scotia, Canada, we arrived, and as advised, our bags were taken immediately to our awaiting room - 4th floor (top floor). We were greeted with a free non-alchohol beverage and very warm smiles. After a tour of the breakfast room, we were advised our room was ready. We were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary and my husband casually mentioned this when booking the hotel, late in 2007. Though we didn't send a reminder, there was a fresh flower bouquet with a Happy Anniversary message from the Nadia. That was the first of many surprises.Our room was small, but the celings were very high, there was plenty of shelving and a closet. There was also an in room safe. The room was immaculately clean. Our bedspread had the most terrific message - Lounge. We had a balcony, which was a wonderful added touch -like another room altogether.The breakfast was a perfect start to the day - a variety of breads/pastry and cheese - tea/coffee/orange juice. Lots of choice for spreads - loved the nutella and croissants - and the coffee - Wow!The in room fridge was put to good use as was the in room kettle and tea supplies.There was a very powerful fan, for any one who likes to partake in the greenery of Amsterdam - this worked well to keep our room smelling fresh.The bathoom was also extremely clean, and the shower was powerful and HOT! Just the way I like it. The cleaning staff was excellent, even calling our room to make sure everything was okay.The customer service desk was open 24 hrs/day - with a buzz to get in rule, it is best to get a 24 hr hotel instead of one that will put a curfew on your evening out.Yes, it was rough to walk up four flights of stairs after a full day of walking but it was so satisfying to get up there and take a load off.I would recommend this hotel to any one who is able to handle the stairs. I must assume though, that a lot of the hotels in the area would have the same steep stairs.Thank you to the Nadia for helping to make our first visit to Amsterdam the best it could be. We miss you.

<Content>Less than what I expected The Hotel Nadia was okay. Just okay. The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed at in my life! I couldn't dream of unpacking a thing. Not a thing. And the breakfast was very basic; bread, cheese, croissant, coffee...that's it. I have stayed in Amsterdam before and have paid less for more...much more. The staff however was very nice and very helpful. I do feel though that they were obsessed with what their rating from me would be. It's amazing what the Travel Site ratings impact is on hotels now. I think they get terrified of getting a negative review. Sometimes I wonder how much these reviews are 'rigged'. So, I will give them a neutral.

<Content>rooms too small All the reviews about the staff are true they are so friendly and helpful. While we were there my husband was unwell and the manager and staff went out of their way to help us.A word of warning dont try the hash unless you are used to it, it was our first time and we had a very bad experience had to spend the first evening in the room which was much too small for two people . The breakfast was fine and free tea and coffee all day was nice touch. Stairs not as bad as I thought they would be. Try to get a room with a balcony or could get claustrophobic . Great location could walk everywhere. Get train from airport then no. 13 tram stops outside hotel.

<Content>Woonderful place to stay! This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in; the room was beautiful with an exquisite view over the canal. Walking distance of all the main sites plus tram and canal tour stops almost immediately outside the door. The staff were friendly, helpful and genuinely kind; the breakfasts were delicious and the beds were comfy. I have already recommended this hotel to friends travelling to Amsterdam and I would recommend it to anybody!

<Content>A Plsant Stay My friend and I originally booked a hotel, which is in the same building but 4 doors down the street from Hotel Nadia. But we had to move to Hotel Nadia because our booked room was too small. We were so happy we found Hotel Nadia. The staffs were super friendly and helpful with tourist information and day trip ideas. The room although small, can be considered a decent size, as in Amsterdam standard. The beds are very comfortable. We have a shower/toilet in the room, as well as a fridge, a safe, a TV and a desk with 2 chairs. Breakfast was served in a beautiful petit dining area on the 2ned floor. The buffet style breakfast isn鈥檛 fancy but has all the basic items. The location is perfect!!!!! A short 3 minutes walk to Anne Frank鈥檚 house and the trendy Jordaan neighborhood. 10-15 mins walk to Central station, Dam Square and Red light district. 15-20 mins walk to the museum area. I would stay at Hotel Nadia again on my next trip to Amsterdam!

<Content>Fantastic Location, Friendly Staff Honestly, I'm kind of mixed about the Nadia. While I found the location to be perfect and the staff super friendly, the rooms are tiny (which I know is par for the course in Europe) and the beds were so uncomfortable - the sheets are like sandpaper. We had 2 separate stays while in town and the first half we were upgraded to the suite. I'm not sure how much that normally costs, but it was a good sized room with a nice view and a balcony. The stairs are rather daunting, around 75 total to the 4th floor, but it was our daily exercise. The second stay was in a room that was really small and almost had no place for 2 people to put their luggage, and we traveled lightly. The rooms were both clean and each came with a fridge, and coffee/tea maker, which was nice. The staff was always helpful. I can't comment on breakfast since we wanted to enjoy those delicious Dutch pancakes in town.If I didn't have to sleep in those beds again, I would recommend the Nadia. Again, the location can't be beat.

<Content>really nice little hotel, idealy situated for city break We booked directly on their website. We found that the prices were the best available anywhere at the time, especially seeing as it was slap bang in the middle of the city. The staff were all really friendly and helpful. The rooms were small, but everything you need was in there (shower room, safe, cable TV, fridge, Tea and coffee etc) and when you are on a city break, you are out most of the time anyway. The breakfast was fine, nice break and cheese. not much variety. Overall my Wife and I found it very quaint and really really nice. If we return to Amsterdam ( and we probably will ) we will certainly stay at the hotel. Brett and Kerrie Robinson

<Content>Small but perfectly formed I have been coming to Amsterdam every week for some months now with work. It's been the Easter holidays so I've found many of the hotels booked out.I had been checking Tripadvisor and Hotel Nadia was quite high up the list. I like my creature comforts when I'm away and to be honest with you, my heart sank when I walked up to the front of the hotel, it didn't look great... I always think you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover though.The people on reception were very friendly and helpful. The room was small, and a little noisy (it was at the front of the hotel next to the main road), if you get a chance ask for a room with a canal view as it will be on the side of the hotel where there's less traffic.Other than being small the room had everything you'd need, there was also free wi-fi which is hard to find in Amsterdam. It's really close and easy to walk to Centraal Station as well as all of the tourist spots nearby.All in all a very pleasant (and cheap) stay, I'm sure I will be back there.

<Content>Lovely days We were 8 adults staying at the hotel for 3 nights. The service was exellent. The staff were smiling, helpful and very nice, so we had 3 very fine days. Our rooms were small, but clean and well-equipped. The hotel has a good atmosphere and is situated near shopping-areas and the center of the city.Birgit B. JepsenDenmark

<Content>Nadia Hotel....Love or Leave it? I've traveled throughout Europe quite a bit and stayed at several different hotels. I know that most older hotels in Europe are not as big as what we're accustomed to in the States, and prepare myself for this ahead of time. The Bad Stuff-The photos used on Nadia's website are very misleading. A panaromic view is shown which gives the viewer an illusion that the rooms are bigger. We had a triple room with a balcony. The room was ridiculously small! Two people would've fit comfortably in this room. The bathroom/shower was a joke! The shower leaked throughout the bathroom which made the situation even worse. If you're not young  in decent health, I would leave this hotel alone because of the most treacherous stairs! The Good Points-The hotel staff is most delightful! They were all very eager to help  gave us great advice. Although they were pleasant it's still not enough for me to go back. The balcony was fabulous. As far as the location, it was great. Not far from Dam Square  the Red Light District. The price was fair considering what we lived with for 4 days. If you don't mind being in small spaces, climbing like 80 stairs  sleeping on a rock hard bed with matching pillow, then this is the place for you.

<Content>Great staff, great location I stayed at the hotel Nadia for two nights with my boyfriend and really enjoyed the experience.We stayed in a double room with balcony, on the top floor. The stairs were a bit of a mission (but you soon get used to them!) the room was an awkward shape and the en suite made it quite small, but my boyfriend and i both felt the lovely view from the balcony outweighed these negative points.The staff on the front desk were lovely - we came into contact with three different people on reception and each were polite,friendly and very helpful in giving directions and recommendations.The breakfast was simple but adequate, and served in a lovely breakfast room with views over the canal and the catherdral.All in all, a lovely hotel with character and a great base for those wanting to explore amsterdam.**WORD OF ADVICE** there is an italian restaurant quite near the hotel called Venezia del nord...horrible food,atmosphere and service-i would avoid at all costs!!instead there is a lovely indian restaurant opposite catherdral which is definitley worth a visit!!Also, there is a airport shuttle bus, run by connexxions, which is a cheap and quick way to get door to door service between the hotel and airport.

<Content>Friendly, convenient, reliable (and small) I booked two nights at the Nadia in early April just 36h before turning up - it was one of the last rooms available in such a central location, just off Dam Square and in the Western Canal cafe and shopping belt.The hotel is in a building on Keizersgracht canal up some very steep stairs, but they'll bring all your bags up and down; and the rest of the time...I guess it makes up for the lack of a gym...and all those pancakes.The other downsides are that the rooms are tiny and they can be strict on the no-visitors rule. They are cosy, spotless, warm and quiet though. Also, the attention to detail makes a difference: the fridge is great to stock up on drinks from the nearby Albert Heijn supermarket, and the kettle was good for a cuppa coming in from the unseasonable cold. The shower heads are cordoned off quite effectively from the rest of the mini bathroom so the floor might get wet, but little else will. For the record, water pressure and heat were excellent - even on the fourth floor in the primetime chilly morning rush.Other perks included wireless internet and super management (welcome drinks, plasters for blisters, a toothbrush at midnight, taxi to the airport...you name it, it was taken care of with a smile).Summary: I had called a million places and Nadia's rates on absolute terms are about as low as Amsterdam gets. You might be able to find a larger place if you try earlier, but Nadia is tough to beat for convenience, reliability, friendliness and last-minute availability.

<Content>See Both Sides of the Coin in Amsterdam In the beginning it seemed very hectic when we arrived, but the staff handled everything very well. The staff let us check in way before check-in time which is rarely seen. The location is great! It gives you the opportunity as a traveler to see both sides of the coin in amsterdam. The rooms are a little bit outdated, but very clean, cozy, and affordable. It is a very secure hotel, and would definitely recommend returning...

<Content>Excellent location; good value for money Very friendly and competent staff; very clean; free wifi access to the internet is a definite bonus; truly lilliputian rooms (at least the single room I had) but then this is Amsterdam...; breakfast OK but nothing to write home about; thin-walled so earplugs are a must if you have no desire to listen to your neighbour's tv programmes; overall good enough value for money for Amsterdam (in absolute terms though 90 euros per night is really expensive for such a small room... it really is just for sleeping and showering ;) )

<Content>Hotel Nadia Hotel Nadia is a place to experience ... the rooms are small but it is all so interesting ... it is real, unlike a lot of new hotels. Osam, the manager is lovely as too are the other staff (esp the lady that works at reception) ... you are made to feel welcome and are well looked after. The breakfast room is also inviting, once again not much space, but that's Amsterdam. The breakfast room has a view of a canal and streetscape offering a nice way to wake up. Our room also had a view of the canal and a small balcony. Worth a visit.

<Content>Very friendly...very basic Took the shuttle bus from the airport (go to information desk at the airport for details) which was very reasonable at 鈧?1 return as opposed to approx 鈧?0 each way in a taxi!Upon arrival i was a little bit disappointed as the outside of the hotel looked dingy (but then again, dont a lot of hotels in Amsterdam look like that?!!). We gained access to the hotel via a buzzer which allowed us step into the hall and oh my god...what a sight!!! There were 2 flights of stairs which were quite high and very steep...we compared it to going up a ladder lol. However we were told to leave our bags there and to proceed to the reception area (at the top of these 2 flights).We were greeted by the owner who offered us some free soft drinks from the fridge in reception (this offer was made each time we returned to the hotel). Our room was then up 2 more steep flights of stairs and also at the front of the building. The owner told us that we could change rooms if we weren't happy. As the trams run most of the night it was quite noisy but we decided to stay as we were only there for 2 nights and just couldnt be bothered with the hassle.Breakfast was a substantial continental breakfast although the breakfast room was quite small and somewhat cramped.The Nadia was a cheap hotel so it's the usual 'you get what you pay for'! If you're anyway incapacitated dont dream of going here. If you're unfit like me and my partner go for the exercise lol!It's in a great location on the street at the back of the Royal Palace which is just a 3 minute walk from Dam Square.We would go back again coz we're not that fussy, it was ideal location, it was cheap and the staff were very friendly

<Content>What A Great Stay My wife and i stayed at the Nadia whilst travelling around europe on our honeymoon.We arrived at the hotel to be greeted with the mount everest staircase.We were pleased when a staff member said they would take care of our bags.We checked in and were toldwe had been given a room upgrade.It was a larger room facing the canal.We had been in the room 10 minutes when there was a knock on the door.They had sent a bunch of flowers to room for us to celebrate our marriage.We spent 4 nights there and the stay was 1st class from beginning to end.We were given helpful information an were to go and how to get there.The owner of the hotel helped us book our transfer to the airport and even rang when we were checking out to thank us for staying with them and to wish us well on the rest of our travels.I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying there.It is in a great location and is value for money.I would not hesitate to stay there in the future

<Content>The Perfect Place Our family with a teenager stayed at the Hotel Nadia. This hotel had everything we could ask for in a vacation. The hotel staff were very helpful with everything from sightseeing directions to calling a cab for us when we needed it. The hotel also provided a very good location and a great view while we had morning breakfast.Our room was a family room with 3 sets of windows which overlooked the canal and we could also see the Anne Frank Museum across the canal, which is just a short walk. We could not ask for a better location and view. It was The Best. The tram, canal taxi, and bus also has stops within 2 minute walk.This hotel will always be at the top of our list for our next visit to Amsterdam . Give the Hotel Nadia a try, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>what a friendly, helpful well located hotel we have just returned from a two night stay at the Nadia, It is a great location, right opposite Ann Franks house and a short walk to Dam Square and the other sights.No good if you cant climb stairs, but there is lots of help with your luggage etc. The rooms are small but spotless, really clean and compact, tea and coffee in plentiful supply, also free welcome soft drinks on arrival. Breakfast is continental and fresh and lots of hot coffee.The staff and management made our holiday memorable, so friendly and helpful and spoke excellent english, Thank you Nadia see you again soon for my next birthday !!! had fab time five star *****

The hotel itself is warm and very comfortable. It is well cared for and all the staff especially Michelle and the manager are fantastic. Prices here are excellent. In the morning breakfast is great too which a nice range of sweets and drinks to choose from. I would always return there if I go back to Amsterdam.

<Content>Hotel Nadia Me and my boyfriend stayed in the nadia hotel when we visited amsterdam.When we first got to the hotel we were greeted by the staff, who were very friendly, they gave us both a complimentery drink and took our bags to our room.At first i thought it was quite small, but once youve unpacked and sorted yourselfs out its perfect size. Nice and cosy!The hotel is in a wicked location, only a 5min walk to dam square and from dam square everything is next to you.I will definatly be returning to the Nadia hotel on my next trip to the dam!

<Content>great friendly welcome On arrival at the hotel which was close to all the attractions. Myself and my husband where given a warm welcome by all of the staff who went out of their way to help. The rooms were well furnished with free t.v. a free safe and a small fridgefreezer. I would recomend the Hotel Nadia to anyone visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Nadia a great hotel Just returned from a great weekend in AmsterdamWe stayed at the Nadia Hotel and had a great time. This is a traditional Dutch Hotel that has been recently modernised, but still retains its original character.The staff are great, very helpful and friendly.the rooms are cosy  compact but have everything you need. The hotel is ideally located for the centre and is only 10 mins walk to Dam square where you can walk or catch a tram to any part of the city. The Anne Frank museum is only 5 mins walk along the main road.We had a front facing room with a balcony and a great view. Because of the noise of traffic, light sleepers would be better asking for a rear facing room.Overall an excellent value hotel, ideally located for exploring the city.

<Content>Returning back to Amsterdam and Nadia After 8 years we had a chance to visit Amsterdam and Hotel Nadia again. Warm welcome, friendly staff and clean rooms are the bonus of Nadia and once more they proved customer satisfaction is their one of most important priority.

<Content>Different, friendly, but bring your climbing boots! A lot of what I'll say has probably been said, but perhaps there's no harm in an update. The most recent trip was my second time at the Nadia, and I enjoyed it as much as the first time!A few observations, plusses and minusesIt's about 10 mins walk from the Dam and all the sights and sounds around there. It's less than 10 minutes to the Anne Frank House and other sights in that area.It's on the tram route for the Rembrantplein and the Zoo.The staff couldn't be friendlier and more helpful - from carrying bags upstairs, offering (non-alcoholic) drinks on arrival, providing maps  event guides, and making reservations for the hotel/airport shuttle, they couldn't do enough.The rooms are small, but comfortable and had all amenities - I was in a single room on the top (4th ) floor, and had a good size bed, ensuite with shower, TV, tea/coffee making facilities, safe and chair  desk. The room was spotless, and housekeeping called every day to make/change bed, clean bathroom, etc.The building is old and quirky - so you won't get a sterile square box to stay in. You may hear next door watching TV or....(well, it is Amsterdam!). You may hear your neighbours who've stayed out later than you coming home, saying goodnight and heading to bed.Yes, there are a lot of steep steps and no lift, so don't wear high heels and don't get too drunk while out for the evening! The staff will carry cases up and down, just ask!I asked for a non-smoking room, and was told they're in short supply - but I got one, so didn't have any difficulties mentioned by another reviewer.General noise - I was at the back of the hotel, so heard very little outside noise. Remember that you're in the middle of a city, which doesn't sleep, so noise is to be expected.I spent 4 nights here this time, and was very happy with the experience.Two tips- get the Conexxion hotel shuttle from Schipol to the door of the Nadia. Return fare is 鈧?1 and well worth the trip. You'll be dropped at the door, and the hotel will book the return trip for you. - Cafe Panorama, at the other end of the block is a nice place to eat (Italian pasta/pizza and steak).

<Content>Top marks to Nadia Stayed here for a long weekend the hotel is within easy walking distance from the city centre and less than 50m from the closest tram stopThe room was small but spotlessly clean,nice fresh continental breakfast each morningstaff couldn't do enough for us with complimentary drinks nearly evey time we went to receptionThe reception area has loads of leaflets on places to visit and the staff are more than happy to offer adviceMore than happy to keep bags safe on early check in /late check outThe only negative would be the stairs might be steep for some people but this is normal in Amsterdam

<Content>A Real Gem I'm going to keep this short, as everything has been said. We had 2 wonderful nights in this hotel, which , at 2 stars, is punching way above its weight !!!Don't be a snob, don't go for the corporate bland option, stay here and discover the real Amsterdam  its people! Climb a few stairs, stay in a smaller room. If either of those bothers you, then shut up  pay more. You will not find better value for money than this hotel. I will be back and sooner rather than later. Thank you Osam for your hospitality it was not just polite, it was warm and friendly. We could not have expected anything like the welcome we got. Thank you for making the trip so special!!!!!!

<Content>Think twice about this place We don't understand how this hotel got such good reviews on Trip Advisor - we only booked it because it did and were quite disappointed; now maybe will think again about the reliability of this site.Positive:* Staff very friendly and helpful at all times of day - in fact, they were too nice for such a disappointing place* Rooms well equipped and clean* Central location* Nice balcony (if you can stand the noise - see below)* Free drink on arrival (non-alcoholic)* Nice shower, in our room, at leastNegative (where to start...):* We had rooms at the front of the hotel which were very noisy - the tram rails were being changed during our stay, so we were woken 2 out of the 3 nights at 3 or 4am (I think that's what time it was) by the most awful noise that even ear-plugs couldn't block out* The hotel was very smoky - fine if you're out for a good time, but forget it if you have children, worth avoiding; everyone came back wheezing and coughing and we all stank of smoke of all types; people smoking in the middle of the night, smoke coming into room under doors, etc.* Breakfast was very disappointing - if you like cold croissants, cold bread, packaged rusks, packaged ginger bread and processed cheese (hardly what you'd expect in the land of cheese!) then you'd love it, but we didn't; no cereal, no fresh milk, no hot food (unless you asked for toast), no yoghurts, no fruit, nothing, even the bread was out of a packet* The rooms we had were tiny - no room to swing a cat; the only comparable thing is a berth on a ship and even then, we had bigger when we went to Santander by ferry; sitting on the toilet, your legs hit the door; also rooms very poorly lit* Expensive for what it was - we paid about 560 euros for 3 kids in one triple bedded room and 2 adults in a double bedded room for 3 nights and that included a discount for cash* TV was okay - lots of channels, but not all TV's received BBC - our kids room did, but our's not; CNN (puke!) was all we gotOther points:* Stairs - we knew there'd be lots, but 73 steps to our floor was a bit excessive, especially after walking the whole day (we were on the top floor) and all were steep* We're sure there are probably decent rooms in the hotel, but we didn't get them; perhaps a stay on the 1st or 2nd floor or inside rather than outside would be better - would recommend asking if you want to stay here* Stayed in much better places for much less money even on previous visits to Amsterdam. Would recommend looking for somewhere else and think about being slightly further out as that's probably what makes this place so expensive; think about a non-smoking place as well, you can always visit a cafe or a pub - they smoke everywhere anyway!

<Content>Great place to stay! Stayed at the Nadia for a 2nd time in as many years. Visited for 4 nights and had a great time. Osam and his staff offer top quality service and the location is great.Very reasonable prices allow for Americans to visit this wonderful city despite the weakness of the dollar.The room is small, but offers all of the needed amenities (Shower, Toilet, TV, Phone + I also had a safe and mini fridge) at a low cost. Besides - who stays in the room? :)Very important to me, there is good, strong water pressure and it heats up to steaming hot, no lukewarm water here!Location: It is less than 1/2 mile from the Dam area which is a central hub to the city and offers the following tram stops: 路 9, 16, 24, 25, stop at Dam Square路 14 stops on the left side of the Royal Palace路 1, 2, 5, 13, 17, 20, stop behind the Royal Palace

<Content>Good value, good location, great staff The Nadia is a great value spot in Amsterdam. The rooms are spotless, and the showers are great. The room we had was very small, but it did the job, and was spotlessly clean - it had every amenity you needed, fridge, safe, tv etc. The staff are excellent - very friendly, and it's a really welcoming hotel. The location is very central and it's definitely one of the best hotels in this price range.

<Content>Loved amsterdam and will be back again The very warm and helpful staff at the Nadia made our stay in Amsterdam most enjoyable. There are many stairs to climb at the entrance, but the staff handles all the luggage, and the stairs were really not as bad as they looked. Our room was tiny and simple, but it had everything - TV with lots of channels in English, shower, toilet, even a balcony. Some people might find the tram line noisy, but it didn't bother us. Everything was very clean. The shower/toilet room was also tiny and became very wet and steamy after a shower. The location could not have been more convenient, close to Dam Square with lots of tram lines in the area. It was easy to walk almost everywhere, although the trams were handy at times.

<Content>Best hotel in Amsterdam! This hotel is in a great location a 3 minute walk away from Dam Square where all the shops are. We arrived too early for our room and got given a complimentry breakfast whilst we waited. Me and my 4 friends stayed here in January (very cold but still nice!) we booked a quad room on the website and paid on arrival. Room was perfect 4 single beds, we had a tv which played music channels and had a view of the canal. Staff at the hotel were the best I have ever come across, so helpful. They ordered us taxis and ordered us pizzas when we wanted to eat in! They also helped us in with our suitcases up the stairs in the entrance. Breakfast was lovely fresh croissants, cakes, bread and fruit juices. I would definately come back to the Nadia, made our trip to Amsterdam!

<Content>wonderful stay This hotel is very welcoming. It is situated in the centre of Amsterdam so in a very good position. The staff at Nadia hotel are fantastic, they will answer all your questions. They provided us with many brochures that helped us alot aswell. The prices are very good too. The rooms are so cozy and warm that you'll forget all the cold of the outside in the winter. If I had to go back to the beautiful city of Amsterdam, I will definetly stay in this hotel again because I felt at home there. I would suggest this hotel to everyone that is going to Amsterdam because in this hotel you feel more welcomed than anywhere else. Rita  Justin.

<Content>loved amsterdam other reviews are correct staff were excellant, couldnt do enough for us. We arrived early (10.00) and we were allowed to help ourselves to breakfast which therefore gave us an extra breakfast. The hotel then allocated our room at 10.45. As we were also leaving late, although we checked out we were also able to go and get a drink and sit in the breakfast bar. Rooms at the front were noisy and if I stopped again I would request a room at the back. As said rooms were very small and it was hard to sit in the rooms, however we did just want the hotel as a base Really close to Anne Franks house which is definatly worth a visit.

<Content>Great hospitality, stairs aside! I stayed here as a time-zone-adjustment stop on a 16-day trip to Europe. The staff was incredibly accommodating, including welcome drinks, directions, calling cabs, good English and overall attitude.Yes, as noted in other reviews, the stairs are pretty remarkable, especially after a full day/night out and about, but those aside, the hotel was a good value, clean and, as noted above, friendly and hospitable staff.Very close to Anne Frank Museum, coffee shops and other sites in the area.I'd recommend this hotel highly though you must be mobile in order to handle the stairs.

The hotel is in a great location , around the corner from Anne Frank House and a short walk to the Dam Square. The rooms are small but very clean and comfortable and the service form all staff memebers was fantastic, i would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel or staying again.

<Content>great little hotel this little hotel is great. first of all it has a great location just off the Dam square. right under this hotel,(as many are actually upstairs there) is shopping and a few good places to eat! When you first arrive there is a buzzer door you smile into the camera and they buzz the door open for you. in you go and the craziest stairs are right in front of you to the hotel level on the second floor. when you are arriving they send someone down to greet you and carry your baggage up for you as there is no elevator. up the stairs is the front desk with a humorous and very helpful staff. Of all the hotels i have stayed at in amsterdam, this one has had the best service.of course the rooms are tiny, but who needs them while in this cool city. they were clean and comfy and i had a canal view room with a spacious balcony for two or three even with chairs. More about the location, it is only five minutes walk to the dam square which is great since we were there for new years. it lies i believe west of the dam for your info and in a good area too!they practice the notion of keeping your room key for you when you go out so no worry of losing it since you probably wont remember much any way!

<Content>Fabulous hotel!! We stayed at the Nadia for 2 nights, on arrival the stairs did look scary but there was someone who came running down to take our luggage for us, when we checked in the staff could not of been more helpful, you get a FREE arrival drink and they took our luggage to our room, where there is fridge, tv and safe! The rooms are VERY tiny but they are perfect if you are just sleeping in them and a quick shower, the only problem we had was the noise from the road and i am a very light sleeper we stayed in room 307. I cannot comment on the breakfast which was from 7.30am - 10.30am as we were not up in time for it. On check out we had no problems and we were offered again a FREE leaving drink. I would certainly recommend this hotel and for the price you cannot beat it. - ABSOLUTLEY 1ST CLASS SERVICE, Thank you.

<Content>Loved staying at The Nadia! We chose hotel nadia based on their rates - they were the cheapest place we could find - and we were pleasantly surprised by its amenities. For a 2 star hotel, they offer many of the amentities of a higher rated hotel. We were greeted at the door with a smile, a porter took our luggage to the room. Our room was quite small - enought room for a double bed and not much else, but we had a balcony! We had a continental breakfast each morning we were there. The hotel is also extremely centrally locate. About a block from the Anne Frank House on one side and about 3 blocks from the Dam Square on the other side. Not to mention the fact that a tram line runs right outside. There was 24 hour front desk coverage and the hotel staff were able to accomodate every request we had. They aren't the most glamorous hotel, but I loved staying there, and I would recommend it to anyone, and should I go back to Amsterdam I would stay there in a heartbeat.

<Content>lovely hotel, good location just back from 3 nights at the nadia hotel. couldn't really fault anything. yes, the stairs are VERY steep as mentioned previously, but we never once had to carry our luggage up or down the stairs.we were met on arrival and as it was too early to check in, our bags were brought to the luggage room and when we got back to the hotel later and went to the room our bags were already there.when checking out, they too looked after the bags and were downstairs ready for us to leave.the rooms are small but had more than enough facilities- tv,fridge,toilet/shower,safe,tea/coffee and hairdryer  irons were available from reception on request. would not think the room would be suitable for a girls weekend though - especially if your inclined to bring alot of baggage...location: 3-4 minutes from dam square and a further 10min from central station.the hotel is also on a tram route so all the major destinations/attractions are easily accessible if you don't fancy walking.the shuttle bus from airport to hotel is very handy-would definately travel this way again.staff very helpfull  friendly, received map of amsterdam and welcome drink on arrival. breakfast was typical continental style. some hotels charge extra for this.would definatley consider staying here again.

<Content>Pretty Good My first time in Amsterdam I stayed at this property so I don't have much to reference as far as other hotels in Amsterdam go. In terms of price when compared to other places I looked at, it was a pretty good deal. I felt that the location was pretty good as me and my friends were able to walk to just about everything we wanted to do. The staff are some of the nicest people I've ever dealt with at a hotel, I can't say enough about how welcome they made us feel. On a side note, I left my expensive iPod and Bose headphones in my room and I didn't realize it until after I left the city. I called them and they put the items to the side for me. I was supposed to arrange for a pick-up service to get the items mailed back to me but trying to get all of that arranged was beyond my capabilities at the time so unfortunately those items got left there. I kinda wish they would have just let me send them the money to ship the stuff back to me but alas... I hope they enjoy them!The room I was in was on the top floor and although extremely small (which I hear is the standard in Amsterdam) I thought it was clean and provided everything a twenty-something guy like me would need. The free wireless Internet was a nice bonus. I can't say much about the noise although I had a room that faced the street since I never got to bed until the early morning. Oh, the water pressure in the shower was good and the water was nice and hot. The towels provided are laughingly small but I guess I'm a spoiled American.The breakfast was pretty good. Actually, the best croissants I have *ever* had were there. Go figure, I couldn't find a better one in Paris.The stairs are freaking steep. I mean like almost straight up steep. Me and my friend who got there together laughed our [--] off as soon as we opened the front door to the place because the stairs were so incredible. The front desk guy came down and shlepped our heavy luggage up all of those stairs, totally nice guy, couldn't believe he did it.To sum it up, I'll probably look to go back to this place for my next visit to Amsterdam. The good combination of price, convenience, friendly staff, and decent accommodations is the catch here.BTW, too bad I can't add video to this review. I have excellent footage of the property, rooms and the experience with the stairs!

<Content>Nadia Hotel - Faultless stay I engaged in a considerable amount of research to find somewhere to stay in Amsterdam for a recent weekend in mid December. After reading the reviews, I settled for the Nadia Hotel. It is sometimes an all too often occurrence that people's expectations of some establishments are so high after reading a long tail of positive feedback, that even the slightest issue has a considerable impact on their perceptions of the place. However, the Nadia Hotel was absolutely faultless. Little touches like a free welcome drink and continental breakfast really do make a difference. The staff are excellent - all very friendly and eager to help in anyway they can. A good example is when I returned back late on my first night and mentioned that I couldn't get hold of any beers. Within five minutes there was a knock on my door with one of the guy's holding a couple of cans - which he proclaimed were on the house. The rooms, in typical Amsterdam style for establishments this size, are small. I opted for a single room with balcony, overlooking the bustling Raadhuisstraat. The lack of double glazing does mean the noise of traffic (particularly the trams), permeates into the room - but it is hardly a sleep killer!Rooms have TV, electronic safe, small fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom is very small - yet adequate. Security is good, with a 24hr manned intercom secuity system, and older travellers ought to beware of the extremely steep steps that lead up to the reception and rooms. The location is, in my opinion, excellent. Less than 15 minutes walk from Centraal Station, or a mere 5 minutes from Dam Square - the hotel is ideally located for visitng the major sights of the city. The Nadia Hotel is an excellent choice for the single traveller who prefers the cosy atmosphere of a small hotel, and I will definitely be booking again when I visit the city again.

<Content>Unexpectedly wonderful Though I travel the world-over on weekly basis for business, I have yet to come across a more accommodating staff. -Because most of the staff ARE the owner's, you'll be sure to have the best service ever, too! For a recent holiday stay I easily booked the reservation through the company's website at [--] and I promptly received a confirmation via email. Arrival was just as planned and the hotel took care of everything. A short walk to any of the central downtown attractions, the hotel鈥檚 location is convenient. The tram is easily accessed for more distant destinations or during poor weather. The hotel rooms are of course compact in size, but very clean and certainly adequate for a good night鈥檚 rest. I will return again anytime my travel takes me by way of Amsterdam!

<Content>Great hotel Excellent hotel. The staff was very willing to accomodate any needs I had, and was particularly keen on offering me free drinks on the house which was nice. The breakfast was very nice, and the location was good. I didn't realize that the Jordaan carried with it the hustle and bustle of downtown but at least the Nadia helped to make the hustle less severe. I would definitely return to the Hotel Nadia if I am in Amsterdam again. It is an excellent hotel for the price.

<Content>Loved the location and the staff attitude Simply the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Comfortable rooms, fantastic location, very close to the city centre and reasonably priced compared to its very central location. Above all, what we enjoyed most was the staff attitude, everyone is cheerful, helpful and very enthusiastic, they do make you feel at home. I visited Amsterdam twice and I keep going to the same hotel, it is part of my wonderful experience of this city. I have recommended Hotel Nadia to all friends and family who visited Amsterdam.

<Content>how many stairs?????? My husband and i stayed at this hotel for a four day break.The staff were really helpful and friendly.As reported by other reviews the stairs were really steep no good for anyone with dissabilities etc.they are typical of Amsterdam buildings. The bedroom was small but who stays in their room all day .The sheets etc were crisp white cotton, towels changed every day.If you have a room starting with 4 look out you have 71 stairs to climb yes i did say 71 and they are really steep and narrow. The breakfast room is small,but quaint .We booked the shuttle bus from the airport for a return ticket it was 19.50(euros)a little expensive but you are dropped off at the door and picked up at the door so very convinient.Anne Franks museum is a must so is the Dutch Resistance museum. Fab location.Out of the door turn right 5 mins to the Dam (main square), where you will find the red light district and all the pubs.

<Content>great friendly service and staff, great location and room I found out a week before that I needed to be in Amsterdam for business for just one day. Since that was a Friday, I decided to stay through the weekend and enjoy Amsterdam (my second trip). My company was trying to get me to stay by the airport, but I did a little research here and found the Nadia.I emailed regarding availability and they got back to me quickly to confirm. Since I was travelling solo, and knew of the small rooms I picked the basic accomodation. I also added an additional day a few days before I arrived and was given no hassle at all.I arrived very late on friday following my meeting. Since it was late, cold and rainy, I took a cab from centraal station. Even though I knew the fare was escessive, and commented on it, I still got taken advantage off by the driver. Please beware of this!My reception was warm and I was offered a drink by the gracious man at the desk (sorry I didn't ask his name). He was very helpful my whole stay. The rooms are very small, but typical of the other places I've stayed in Amsterdam. Accomodations were clean and confortable, my top 2 requests. The bathroom was very small, it was hard to wash my face in the sink even!Very close to trams and Dam Square. Excellent location. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. Although if you need western/'american style hotel rooms, you're best to look elsewhere. Thanks for a great stay!

<Content>37 Steps to Reception - Brings me "Home". 3 visits to Amsterdam this year and 3 stays in the Nadia. My first visit was in June when I booked a city break through a Travel Agent. I made my subsequent bookings on-line direcly with the Hotel.On the first visit I took a taxi from the Airport which cost about 鈧?0-00. The next time due to busy traffic and taking an alternative route that turned out to be equally busy cost 鈧?0-00. Third Time I took Train to Central Station for 鈧?-80.My first thoughts on arrival was:- there's the sign for the Nadia Hotel but where is it? The Taxi Driver rang the doorbell and when the door opened I was was a bit taken aback to see a really steep narrow stairway ahead of me. Maybe someone knew that the 39 Steps is one of my favourite films.Having overcome the intial shock, I made it to the Reception. Was given a Welcome Drink from the fridge and sat in breakfast room while my bags were taken to my room. (The hotel staff brought my luggage up and the down stairs on all my visits). I was also given a guidebook to Amsterdam 2007 and a leaflet about the Hotel. Had to lodge 鈧?0 Deposit for the Room Key /TV remote control - not asked for on subsequent visits.I did not read any reviews of the Hotel until after my first visit. Most reviewers comment on the friendly staff which I fully endorse. What sticks out in my mind was on Sunday morning when I asked where I would find a Catholic Church ,Osam (the Manager) was very helpful with directions and when I returned later in day the first thing he asked me had I found it.I stayed in a different room each time. One had twin beds. All the rooms I stayed in are all very small. Very Compact. Bathrooms also compact - Toilet -Wash hand basin and Shower. Wouldn't fancy it if I was any way overweight.I found the beds comfortable. Each room has a small fridge and safe. I did find that the safe was a little too high in my last room.One note of caution, mind the bed clothes that you don't trip.Also check if any small step from Bathroom to Bedroom.My most recent room had a balcony overlooking the street.There is a very nice Tearoom on the opposite side on the street called Jennifer's. There are a number ATM machines nearby,although one a few doors from Jennifer's did not take my type of card.I used the Shuttle Bus to return to the airport each time. The Hotel Reception did the booking for me.On my most recent arrival when I took the Train to Central Station, I had intending taking the Tram(which stops close to Hotel) but as it was a dry evening I ended up walking. Probably took about 15 minutes. On reflection maybe a bit too far to walk when pulling a suitcase.The Anne Frank House is only a few minutes away. Dam Square is about 10 minutes. One of my first stops there was Madame Tussauds.The Breakfast room is small. Even though I only have tea and toast at home when I go on holiday I like the Full Fry. So the continental breakfast is always a bit of a disappointment. Tea and Croissant still nice. It is not too difficult to find a restaurant around town that does the big fry. At breakfast, to make tea put teabag in cup and pour Boiling Water from Coffe Type Jug. If you need a bigger cup just ask.The Front door of hotel is always closed. Guests have to buzz everytime thecome in. You have to pass reception to get any of the rooms.Whenever I get back to to Amsterdam and as long as I (or if I should have a travelling companion) can make it up those steps anticipate I will be staying in the Nadia. (Where I hope to hear Osams words of greeting - Welcome Home.

<Content>Above and beyond We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Nadia Hotel,this hotel is located in a great spot for everything in Amsterdam.The management and staff should be proud to say that they own/work in such a clean,hospitable and friendly place.I lost my wallet on a sat evening and returned to the hotel to cancel my credit cards,the staff were more than helpful and can only but thank them for the help they gave.Going back to the hotel we found the staff to be very knowledgable about their great city,the rooms were very clean and kept clean,the food was very nice and would recommend this hotel to anyone.We will be returning to the Nadia Hotel again in the near future..

<Content>Not what I expected I decided to stay in this hotel based on some of the good reviews I read, but unfortunately, I do not agree with them. The hotel was not what I expected. However there were some positive points, I must say that the staff was very friendly and courteous and the hotel location was central. I personally didn't think the hotel was that close to Central Station (it is a brisk 20 minute walk so plan for it if you need to catch a train or a plane) and the stairs are kind of scary and steep. The room smelled bad and the bathroom is the smallest one I have ever seen. Breakfast was not much basically coffee, croissant and bread. I personally would not recommend this hotel unless you are a carefree traveler who is not looking for much in a hotel.

The staff goes out of it's way to accomodate you, the location is great, the rooms are smallish, but modern and clean with all conveniences, you get free breakfast, and the price is right, What more could you ask for?

<Content>Fab ,Friendly and Fun! We have just come back from a weekend in Amsterdam and we had a great time. The Nadia is a 5 minute walk from Dam square. Is is right next door to a pancake house which serves the most amazing food I have had in years!The hotel staff were excellent. They carried the bags up and down the steep stairs for us, they offered us complimentary drinks each time we passed the Reception. They recommended places to eat, things to see and more importantly took the time to show us how to get their!We were up in the gods, on the 4th floor. The room was small but plenty large enough for a weekend stay. The bathroom was spotless and all towles replaced daily if you wanted. It had tea  coffee making facilities and a tv.Continental breakfast was served and really set us up for the morning activities.We would return and recommend this hotel to all.It was in a safe area, clean, friendly and we felt at home!

<Content>Love Hotel Nadia!!! We went to Europe for our honeymoon, and planned to be in Amsterdam for only 3-4 days. We booked online at Hotel Nadia, and when we got there, we were welcomed with cold soft drinks and a bouquet of flowers in our room congratulating us on our marriage! We traveled to Germany and Czech upon leaving, and were intending on traveling on to Italy, but we loved Amsterdam and Hotel Nadia so much, we came back for another 4 days! We had no reservation, but the amazing staff worked their magic and found us a room. When we were shown our room, there was another bouquet of flowers, this time welcoming us home! The rooms are cozy and clean, most with a great view of the church, canal, or both. And if you love cats (like we do) make sure you visit the two kitties who live in the hotel--you can see them thru the window on the way to the breakfast room. Also, we got great dining recommendations from the staff, and even went to a concert with Dennis and his friends. Basically, the only place we stay in Amsterdam is at Hotel Nadia!

<Content>Hotel Nadia - Highly Recommended We stayed at this hotel in 2006 and were so impressed we booked direct with the hotel to return again this year, Nov 2007. The hotel is situated in a nice quiet area close to Dam Square and Ann Franks house. It is only about 8 mins from Central Station. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are cleaned daily. The rooms are not big but then if like us, you just want a base from which to explore this beautiful city, it is perfect. Our room had a TV, fridge, tea/coffee, shower, wc, safe and comfy bed. What more can you ask for ! The staff are all very friendly and helpful. It was my boyfriend's birthday during our stay and when we got back to the room on the afternoon of his birthday, there was a beautiful bouquet of flowers whishing him a Happy Birthday ! You don't get that sort of customer service very often !! We were really impressed. We checked out on the last day and the hotel kindly stored our luggage until late afternoon. Some guests have commented that the stairs are steep, I think there are about 37 up to main reception, but if you are fit and able, this is not a problem. Lets face it, with all the lovely food you will be eating in Dam, then a bit of exercise is a good thing !! I booked a room with a balcony on this visit and it was so nice to sit outside and watch the world go by in the mornings and the view is beautiful.

<Content>This place grows on you OK, here's the deal. After a flight from Moscow, a train ride, a tram ride, a short walk with a ton of luggage, I was pretty upset to see a dingy door leading to two flights of VERY steep and narrow staircase. No elevator. I was not happy (but very polite). Well, there was help. A small man told us we didn't have to worry about bringing our luggage up the stairs and that our luggage would be delivered to our room. OK, I'll buy that. After climbing the stairs we entered a very small and depressing receiving area - the front desk so to speak. Still not happy (and still polite-I do have manners). The man behind the desk took total control of the situation, offered us soda's and told us to wait in the breakfast room while our luggage was being brought up and our room was made ready. We headed down a poorly lit hallway with metal room doors on either side. Still not happy and wondering what we got ourselves into. We took a right and entered the breakfast room. Instant happiness! The room was everything you would want in an old European hotel. The room was small but very well decorated and cozy. There were large and beautiful windows and a door leading to a small balcony. I'm happy now. Anyway, the man told us our room was ready and gave us our key. We walked up two more flights of, again, VERY steep stairs. As we entered our room we were so very happy. It was the top corner room overlooking the canal and church. A door entered onto a small balcony and a set of half-moon windows opened to the canal and church. The room was extremely clean and efficient. High ceilings and everything you could possibly need to make your stay comfortable. The bed was very comfy. In the morning we returned to the breakfast room for the complimentary breakfast. The best croissants, jam, coffee, and juice. Again, very nice. The hotel is located near the Anne Frank house on a canal. I recommend this hotel ONLY if you want to brave the stairs. There is no elevator so you need to be able to climb the stairs. The staff at the hotel is far above average. So - excellent staff, great location, cool room, very clean. Give it a try.

<Content>Loved it! Highly Recommended! My wife and I stayed at the Nadia Hotel for two nights, having arranged to layover in Amsterdam on a trip back from Russia. We stayed in a deluxe room with a balcony. It turned out to be a corner room with a great view. It was pretty small, but well-appointed and very nice. Since it was our first trip to Amerstedam, it was a little bit of a challenge figuring out the routine for getting to the hotel via train and tram, but not bad. The 2nd time would be a piece of cake. We ended up getting off the tram too early and dragging our overstuffed luggage a couple of extra blocks to the hotel. We were pretty tired when we arrived at the front entrance. Then -- when the door opened there was an almost vertical narrow staircase descending into the heavens and no lift. We quickly overcame our initial reaction, however. The staff were very friendly and carried all of our bags up to the third floor room. The breakfast was excellent. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Short break in Amsterdam Having read the previous reviews on this site, the hotel was much as we expected. The stairs are really steep (more like a ladder) and the room was very small but quite clean. The en-suite shower room was particularly small as was the hand basin in it, but if you want to stay in a budget hotel in the middle of the oldest part of Amsterdam this is what you get. The staff were very helpful and friendly and were able to answer all our questions like the best time to see Anne Frank House (we could see the size of the queue from our room!) and what trams to catch. We would rate the Nadia as offering good value and would be happy to stay there again.

<Content>Excellent, what a gem!!! (Robert from New York) Stayed at the Nadia Hotel for 7 days and truly enjoyed my visit to Amsterdam. The hotel is located in the city center, everything is within walking distance and Osam and his staff were so hospitable and accommodating, it was one of the highlights of my trip.Upon arrival, I was already invited to have breakfast, and almost every evening was given a complimentary drink by Osam - a very generous and great gesture of hospitality. I really felt at home staying at the Nadia.I feel quite fortunate finding this hotel and there's no other place I'll stay when I go back to Amsterdam. Hope to see you again Osam!

<Content>Hotel Nadia - Reccomended I stayed for one night in the Hotel Nadia on the 10th November. The hotel is in a fantastic location, only a couple of minutes from Dam Square, and close to the Anne Frank Huis. As with many buildings in Amsterdam, you enter via a very narrow steep staircase so the hotel would not be suitable for older people or people with disabilities. Upon arrival we were given a free soft drink, and were allowed to leave our luggage until our check in time later that day. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was very small, but the bathroom was nice and the room was very clean. I stayed with a friend in a 2 bed room, and the beds were literally only 1 foot apart, but it was fine just for a weekend. If I were staying for more than a few days I would get a single room to myself. The hotel serves breakfast, although I didnt try it as we were more interested in exploring Amsterdam. On the whole, I would reccomend the Hotel Nadia to budget travellers, and short term visitors. For the location and price, it's hard to beat.

<Content>Excellent Amsterdam Experience A friend and I stayed at the Nadia Hotel for two nights. The room was small, but clean and well organized....with two large windows overlooking the street and canal. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Beware of the extraordinarily steep stairs going up to the reception! Very typical of dutch canal houses. I will definitely stay at the Nadia again.

<Content>Fantastic This was stated as 2* Hotel, this is not justified whatsoever, My husband and I stayed here on the 2nd of november for our wedding anniversary, we found the hotel to be accessable to all attractions and very reasonable in price the room was clean and had all the ammenities you would expect with fab views of the canal the staff were superb could not do enough for us and we had flowers on arrival. although the rooms are small, this is to be expected in period buildings like this one they have everything you need a safe and TV big double shower and nicely decorated. The breakfast room was very clean and had coffee fruit juice, croissants, bread jam, butter, cheese. typicaly continental. Upon arrival we were given complimentary cans of pop. which is needed as the stairs are very very steep not recommended if you have severe walking difficulties, but the staff do all they can to help with luggage and storage if you arrive early or late. Overall an amazing experience we hope to be staying for longer next year.

<Content>Perfect choice My wife and stayed at Nadia for 5 nights whilst exploring Amsterdam. It was a perfect choice in terms of location, the rooms had everything we needed, the price is amazing considering its central location, it is extremely clean and the staff could not more to make our stay everything we wished for.We stayed in a back room which as reqested was really quiet you wouldn't believe your were in the centre of a city. A good breakfast was provided in the small but adequate breakfast room. The stairs provided some good cardio vascular exercise each day !! A perfect break we will return soon.

<Content>A Most Pleasant Stay The Hotel Nadia was our home away from home for three days in Amsterdam. The hotel delivered beyond our expectations! Our room on the first two nights was small; but well thought out: organized, functional, and every space put into good use. On the third night, we got a room upgrade at no extra cost- a corner room with nice views out to the canal and church- and with a balcony! Service was impeccable: on arrival, the staff carried the bags up into our room and on departure carried it down. We were offered free drinks on arrival and breakfast take-out on our very early departure. Internet connection problem was urgently resolved. The staff was courteous, professional, and very helpful. The hotel鈥檚 location was central to Amsterdam鈥檚 many attractions and easily accessed by foot. Finally, Hotel Nadia鈥檚 website provided a well of useful information for first timers to Amsterdam like us. Thanks to you Osam and to your staff for making our stay a most pleasant one!

<Content>Room was tiny, economical, clean and shower worked great. Perfect! The Nadia was a small walk-up hotel. The neon sign telling you to enter through a narrow door was of slight concern. The picture on the website is accurate, but entering up a steep set of stairs didn't quite feel like the picture in my head. We were greeted with a warm smile, welcoming us to the hotel. Our room wasn't ready and we were offered a beverage and we opted to wait in the Breakfast Room. The Breakfast Room overlooks a canal and is quite simple and clean. We reached our room by going half way down the main stairs and entering a door. It was the most crooked hallway in the world with doors for rooms on both sides. Our room was very small and efficient. Two (smaller than twin) beds overlooking the canal with a built-in desk and a small TV. The bathroom was clean and the shower worked great! It was just what I needed for a short overnight trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Great location and extremely helpful staff I stayed for almost a week with Hotel Nadia. The manager and staff were all extremely informative and accomodating. They found me space when I decided to stay a bit longer. The location is great, as you can walk through the Jordaan easily and catch the tram close by. Breakfast is really good. Basically I would agree with all the positive reviews. Yes the rooms can be small and stairs are very steep, but this is Amsterdam and they will carry your bags, no problem!

<Content>Very nice. Very personable staff willing to go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. We reserved a room with a balcony and it was outstanding. Location is very good. Close to the high energy of the red light district but far enough away for peace and quiet. Affordable price. One of the best places I stayed in while in Europe.

<Content>Excellent Quirky Hotel This is a typical DUTCH hotel that was absolutely fantastic to stay in for the real Dutch experience. We were a group of 16 adults (mostly couples) staying in Hotel Nadia for the weekend to celebrate a 40th birhday. The staff went over and beyond their duty to make sure we had the best stay possible. The breakfast, as stated, is continental but boy do they make a fine croissant-we fought every moring amongst ourselves for first pickings but the hotel always provided an endless supply.Yes the hotel has steep stairs but show me an authentic Dutch hotel that does not. Do as we did and enjoy the quirkiness of this hotel. You will NOT be disappointed.The location is also fantastic; it's only a 3 minute walk from Dam Square and that's after sampling the local delicacies!!

<Content>Best Tourist Hotel Ever This is a great place to stay. The rooms and bathrooms are very small, but it's Amsterdam. The hotel is clean, safe and has excellent location. The staff at this hotel exceeded my expectations. Everyone is friendly and extremely helpful. You should definitely take advantage of the manager, he knows the city really well. He's very helpful and really seems to enjoy giving suggestions (and directions). He mapped out all of our outings and gave us some great restaurant recommendations. This isn't the fanciest hotel, but I'd stay there again. If you're a light sleeper you may want to request a room away from the street, it's pretty noisy by the tram line. Great tourist hotel.

<Content>Great location; great staff Stayed three days in a large room overlooking one of Amsterdam's many wonderful canals. The view was fabuous and the room was spacious and clean. Room service was especially efficient, going as far as hanging some of my shirts. Hotel Nadia is located walking distance from the Dam Square and Central Station. The hotel staff provide very useful directions to various sites. Would stay there again for sure.

<Content>Outstanding Stay My girlfriend and I just returned from a backpacking trip through Europe. We spent a few days in Amsterdam, and found Hotel Nadia via the Internet. We would both stay there again without a doubt. Yes, other reviews about the small size of the rooms are true, but we were only using the rooms to shower, sleep, and drink wine on our private balcony. Otherwise we were out exploring the city. The people running the hotel were the nicest I've meet in my trips in Europe. For instance, one night I went to the lobby and asked the gentleman behind the desk where I might find a store to find wine or beer at the hour of 10pm. He asked what I'd prefer - beer or wine. I said wine. He asked red or white. I said red. He asked that I wait a minute as he finished something behind the desk. He then got up and went out of sight, only to return 10 seconds later with a bottle of red wine. I asked how much I owed him, he said it was on the house. From helpful tips about the city, to comfort in the room, and transportation to the airport, our entire experience in Nadia couldn't have been better.

<Content>after 5 months of traveling it was like coming home! We decided this year to take the vacation of all vacations and left on a five month, around the world adventure in May, staying in all three, four and five star hotels for the entire period. The Nadia was the last stop on our last leg of a month in Europe. We booked it based on the reviews on Trip Advisor, because although it did not have one of the standard upscale brand names that are all over Amsterdam, the reviews were all outstanding. We were not disappointed! From the moment of our arrival everything was beyond our expectations. Although not a standard run-of-the-mill, modern five star hotel, the genuine hospitality, friendliness, attentiveness and service at the Nadia far exceeded anything we had experienced in places we paid four times as much for. Add to that a real classic landmark building two minutes from the center of town looking directly onto the canals with snarling gothic gargoyles leering down from the roof! The Nadia is the real deal! And those stairs! Don't worry, they will run your luggage up and down for you along with anything else you desire, but just experiencing those stairs took us back to the Amsterdam of the 18th century! I wouldn't pass them up for an elevator any day. Osam and his family make you feel like you have come home to Grandma's house. So if you want to experience the real deal while marveling at Amsterdam and be within two minutes walking distance from the Palace, don't take no for an answer and beg Osam for a room with a balcony!

The friendly staff gave us a warm welcome, the continental breakfast which is included in the price of the room makes it very good value for money. The location is perfect, a short walk from dam square. The room was clean with a canal view. We will definately be staying there again next year.

<Content>Good break Amsterdam was OK for a weekend break - reasonably tacky, but tacky can be fun ! Loads of nice restaurants, and the native Dutch themselves are really friendly (can't say the same about all the nationalities there). Downside was graffiti everywhere, and by our fourth day (we were flying back in the evening) we were pretty bored as we had really done all the local sights and would have had to start travelling further afield. The shopping is pretty dull. So a two or three day trip max is good, unless you are planning on travelling outside of Amsterdam.The Hotel Nadia was nice and adequate for our purposes. Again, the staff were really friendly, and the room, although really small and dark, was comfortable and clean - the bathroom was very clean and well maintained, which was good.Nadia is well located - close to the shops and central Amsterdam, so we walked most places. Took the tram out to the museum quarter, which was a quiet area, so I'm glad we were more central.If we could ask for an improvement, then it would be stronger ligghting in the bedroom (we had a 'delux' room - number 5) and a more varied breakfast. Croissants and bread everyday gets boring fast. Again, adequate, but some fruit, yoghurt and cereals wouldn't go amiss.All in all, Nadia is a comfortable, safe hotel in a good location at a not unreasonable cost. Get past the initial impression that the front door gives you and the small bedroom, and you'll end up feeling that it is OK. We would stay here again without any problem.

<Content>Nadia Hotel is Superb. Great Location, Price, Friendly, Clean, Efficient I booked the Nadia Hotel for a group of seven using the hotel's website and found that the manager answered any e-mail enquiries very quickly and was extremely helpful.We had one triple deluxe room, a twin deluxe room and a twin room and all were clean, had en- suite WITH HAIRDRYER and well equipped with tea making facilities.We knew that hotel rooms in the centre of Amsterdam are compact, stairs tend to be steep and we had opted for this hotel knowing it did not have a lift/elevator and we just took out time going up and down the stairs. We were a mixed age group ranging from the age of 25 -60 years. Our luggage was carried up and down for us which was a bonus.The hotel was fully booked during our stay, so I advise you to book well in advance. Every member of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and recommended the best places to go to eat and places to visit. The rooms cleaned and fresh towels every day.The breakfast was Continental style self service in a large room overlooking the canal. The choice of food was limited to various rolls, breads, croissants, jams and spreads and cheese but adequate as you could have as much as you wished and numerous refills of fresh orange juice, teas and coffeesOn our day of departure we stored our luggage in the locked baggage room and we were allowed to use the breakfast room as a meeting point and were offered refreshments.There is so much to do and see that a weekend was not long enough and we all hope to go back and EVERYONE in the group said they would definitely book the Nadia Hotel again!

<Content>I liked the view and the location Good location, near Dam Square. Friendly, efficient, easy to get to, with free internet and a light buffet breakfast and a great view to the Westerkirk from the breakfast room. The staff were very polite and helpful, but weren't in your face. I walked there from the Central Station down Damrak and across the square, but the tram goes right past. In fact, if your room is on the street side there may be sound from the street at night. Mine was, but it wasn't a problem. Would recommend - it's a quaint place, and the website is good. Discount if you pay cash.

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Staff Lots of steep stairs are inevitable in the older canalside buildings in Amsterdam, and this is the main drawback of this hotel. Room slightly cramped, but a wonderful canal view - and a LARGE double bed is not always found in Europe (it was more like UK King or US Queen size). Having a refrigerator in the room was also very useful. We had a problem at the end of the stay when the shuttle bus to the airport (booked for us by the hotel) failed to appear - apparently the booking was lost by the shuttle company. Hotel immediately accepted responsibility and ordered us a taxi to the airport (paid for by hotel). Generally an outstanding experience, with easy transport links and a five minute walk to Dam Square. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Compact Nadia Hotel Experience! Hi. Just returned from weekend break to Amsterdam. Stayed in Nadia and had read reviews in advance - forewarned about small rooms and the stairs but going with logic it's only a bed, didn't worry unduly. Actually thought the stairs were great! Took a photo - just like lots of stairs in canal houses - made us laugh. We were a party of two couples - and were given two rooms - one double and one twin. It was pot luck, and when we went to our room, opened the door - I saw the bed an immediately looked for the other one - assuming we had the twin. There wasn't another one - it was a double bed and with a husband of over 6 ft - it's a good job I'm only small. It was the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The bed had to be that small, it wouldn't have taken another one. The shower was also dodgy. Difficult to get water temperature right - poor pressure - but it would suddenly go to scaulding hot which was a little scary. The good points were that it had a fridge -and a safe which was great. Also luggage care (we only had backpacks) was fine. Left them on last day and picked them up later. Very friendly people, breakfast okay - but get there before 8.30 or you won't get in. Good location - just by Anne Frank house - and pretty easy to get anywhere. Our friends room - the twin - was better. I'm sure ours was the smallest in the hotel. The photos on the website are taken at an angle to maximise space!

<Content>Stay at Nadia Hotel Amsterdam 22nd September 2007We have just spent 4 days in Amsterdam staying at the Nadia Hotel ,the hotel is in a very good position and we found it to be very clean.The staff at the Nadia are very freindly and are always willing to help, the only concern we had was the size of the rooms you can only get into a double bed from one side and the shower room was very tiny also a lack of storage for clothes.

<Content>Nicest People Nadia Hotel is a really gorgeous place to be!The people are very warm, helpful and friendly :DThe room was spot less and the bed SO comfortable and the sheets thick and soft :)This is my second time staying at Nadia Hotel and nearly everything was perfect, the only thing I would say that was not perfect is the shower, it had a strange smell and it was far too close to the toilet for my liking but then again when I stayed last year the shower/toiler was fine, maybe this was just unlucky on my part.Over All, hotel nadia is the place to be! :D

<Content>.fantastic place we have just returned from a weekend in amsterdam,what a great place,people are so friendly and especially the staff at the hotel who made sure our stay was as hassle free as possible.the rooms were clean contained everything we needed eg.shower kettle fridge safety deposit box etc.Every time we handed in our key or retrieved it from the main reception we were offered soft refreshments from the fridge and boy were we glad of all the water. breakfast was continental lovely fresh juice also.We had access to the dining room at all times if we felt like havinga tea or coffee.I would highly recommend the Nadia to any one going to amsterdam its only 4 minutes from Dam Square the heart of the city.Lm defo going back nxt year,the manager of the nadia suggested that my hubby mite get a job in van gough museam[he the image apperantly of vincent].See ye all next year.

<Content>A good Amsterdam experience This a great place to stay. There have been plenty of comments about the steepness of the stairs, etc. In my view, every step is worth it for the welcoming attention at the top of them. First class service, great location, great staff. The rooms are small but every bit of space has been well used and this was no problem at all. Beds were comfortable and spotlessly clean.If you are in a room on the canal side, the location so near to the church with its clock bell chiming each half hour can be a bit disturbing. It helped to find out that it was the same clock Anne Franck used to count the hours while she was in hiding, but a pair of each plugs is all that is necessary to ensure a good night's sleep.Recommended for anyone with a fair degree of fitness (to tackle the stairs.)

<Content>Enjoyable stay at the Nadia Our recent stay at the Nadia was very enjoyable. Osam who is the owner could'nt do enough for you as also his family and staff who are always very polite and made you feel very welcome.Our room overlooked the canal giving us a good outlook of a beautiful church the bed was comfortable,the room was very clean as was the bathroom. The room was small but for a city break of four days was very adequate. The breakfast was continental style which we enjoyed the bread and confectionary was always fresh and the coffee was really nice.Upon our arrival we were provided with a complimentary drink and fresh flowers delivered to our room. This made you feel very welcome. I think it was Osams son who carried our luggage to our room and again on departure. On this note previous entries regarding the steps should be borne in mind,as these stairs are unsuitable for infirm or unfit people. We ourselves did'nt find them a problem. If we go to Amsterdam again we would definately go to the Nadia which we would recommend as good value for money, very friendly atmosphere and in an ideal location for sightseeing.No complaints at all.

<Content>Simply Remarkable! It is my great pleasure to give my review of The Nadia, a little hotel in the center of Amsterdam which provides to the traveler, if they are willing to be challenged as to what a hotel experience is usually like, an amazing and rewarding stay, a small, warm, humble, pleasant place unlike anyplace I鈥檝e stayed in. This is because of the intimate nature of the physical structure, the history, and location of the building, and the intimate nature of the hotel owners and staff. Now it鈥檚 very important to understand; this hotel is not for everybody because, and I like to think in a symbolic way, the two flights of very narrow and very steep staircases that one must climb up to hotel itself. If you鈥檝e stayed there you know exactly what I mean鈥his is an old building with no elevator so in order enter you must climb a big staircase. No joke. It like climbing a small mountain. But if you are up for the task and ready to climb the stairs to see what awaits you at the top then push the buzzer on the street go though the door and up you go! Warm and friendly faces greet you at the top in the very small cozy lobby. A smiling attendant offers to bring your luggage up the steep staircase. You are welcomed with a cold drink. Osam and his staff are ready for your arrival and they addressed me by name before I told them who I was. Osasm sized me up and gave me the loveliest room, #207 by the way, a corner room overlooking the canal and street. He gives rooms based on personal need and his expert knowledge of what room would be best for you. Don鈥檛 expect a luxurious room. Mine was small yet warm, with few amenities. (ok Osam, here is a negative, just like you wanted to know): the bathroom amenities could be greatly improved like better towels, soap, show curtain etc. It was clean but not fancy. Small but cozy. Trade in fancy for an historic building with years of history and personal service. It鈥檚 an old building and an historic monument so I take these things in stride鈥his is not a fancy place, it鈥檚 a genuine place and so some things can slip by. The personal service continued through my stay. Each time I returned to the hotel and by the time I reached the top of the stairs my key was placed for me on the counter. You leave the key each time you go out. The staff experience here is unlike any other. When was the last time you were greeted and attended to by the owner himself who is running the hotel from the big the long counter in the lobby. A place you must spend time in is the kitchen/ breakfast room. There you will find a tasty breakfast in the AM and coffee served all day and late into the night. One morning I ate some croissants and sipped coffee on the small kitchen balcony overlooking the street below. It was bucolic; a memory and feeling I will always cherish. My pleasant interactions with Osam the inn keeper continued my entire stay and during my last night I stayed with him talking for 2 hours and having the nicest exchange. When my cab came at 5:15 am Osam himself carried one of my bags down those steep flights and arranged a cheaper cab to get me to the train. I could go on about the guys who carry your bags up those long stairs and the kitchen staff, the magnificent view of the church across the street across from the Ann Frank House, the location, the location鈥? minutes walk to Dam Square, near all trams, near the quite Jordan and the 鈥? streets鈥?shopping area, an internet caf茅s down the street, good restaurants on the street, and a really tasty french fry cart right across the street鈥?and on and on鈥? but what makes this place great is what YOU can get from it. I will certainly return to the Nadia again when I visit Amsterdam. Osam has already promised me that if I want the same room, it鈥檚 mine although there are so many lovely rooms I might try something new. This is a marvelous hotel experience and should not be missed.

<Content>Enjoyed it Nadia is a lovely hotel in a excellent location and amazing building. The hotel staff is very friendly and they managed to make my stay there unforgettable. The room was very small but with a huge balcony, allowing me to enjoy the canal view, the Westekerk view and the street view. Enjoy Amsterdam from this hotel if you need a place to stay right in the heart of Amsterdam.

<Content>Great hotel After much deliberation and a last minute change from another hotel to the Nadia, all we can say is, brilliant. We read all the whinging reviews about steep stairs and small rooms, so we were forwarned. But you show me a building in Amsterdam without steep stairs, and it does your legs good anyway :-) Greeted by the very friendly Osam (cheers for an excellent stay and a great way to kick off our Euro holiday) Great location and value. It was clean and everything worked, plenty of hot water etc etc. Wont bother trying another hotel when we next visit. If your on to a good thing stick to it. We were even offered a room with a better view after our first night, but we were comfy and couldnt be bothered moving, we didnt go for the view from the room, we went to experience the city. And what an experience it is. We couldn't get over the amount of people in one place, its full on and 3 days was probably abit short, so that just means we will have to go back. And the Nadia is where we will be staying.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Nadia The staff was unbeatable at this hotel. I made a major mistake when booking the hotel, and ended up calling and trying to get two rooms for the very next day instead. Everything was worked out for us, with smiles! It is a great location with a restaurant closeby (turn right out of the hotel, go to end of block--good omelettes), and a pancake restaurant right next door. We were welcomed at the hotel with a cold drink, which was great after a 2 hour drive and the hospitality never ended. The room is quite small, and the reception is at the top of a long set of steep stairs, as people have mentioned. Good little continental breakfast was included with our rate, and the balcony off our room was great in the morning, watching the city wake up! The public transportation of trams was great and convenient for sightseeing, and our car was taken care of by a company the hotel works with. There is also a taxi stand as you go left out of the hotel, and just over the tiny bridge. A great stay at a great price! Pam in Brussels

<Content>A Vsit to Nadia and no Lion or Witch in the Wardrobe This hotel was recommended and we weren't disappointed.The staff were friendly and although the room was small we were able to shoe horn ourselves in quite comfortably. We had a lovely canal view room and I would say the only thing we didn't know about was the clock in the church just over the canal that chimes but as there is so much to do and see you will be exchausted and probably won't be kept awake.We will definately use this hotel again

<Content>Back home at the Nadia We have just returned from our 4th visit to the Nadia Hotel and it just gets better. The Nadia is a very charming hotel with a friendly and personal staff. We enjoy the small, but very clean and charming room with modern facilities. We also enjoy the continental breakfast in the comfortable breakfast room with wonderful views. We look forward to coming home to the Nadia again soon! Peter  Malin, Sweden

<Content>Dinky Room! We stayed at the Nadia from 21 - 23 August. I agree with a previous comment that your heart does sink a little when you arrive outside the hotel and see the entrance sandwiched in a row of shops. My heart sank even more when we were shown to our double room which was really tiny with barely enough room for myself and my partner to move in at the same time. However, after the initial shock wore off we found the room to be more than adequate. The bathroom was small but clean and the shower was surprisingly powerful. Our room had a small balcony which overlooked the main road and canal which was very pleasant as the weather was quite warm. Although I didn't notice the noise from the trams my partner began to find them quite annoying!The staff at the hotel were very friendly and we were given useful maps and a guide book on arrival. The location of this hotel is perfect. We were able to walk from central station and from the hotel to Rembrandtplein, Leidseplein and the museum quarter. We didn't find it necessary to use either taxi's or trams.I chose this hotel based on the reviews on this website, the hotels location and the fact that I wanted to stay somewhere with a bit of character and not a modern chain hotel. I would recommend this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed my stay there

<Content>Wonderfully friendly This is a wonderfully friendly hotel where staff made every effort to ensure that our stay was pleasant and comfortable. We especially liked the fact that we could leave our luggage at the hotel before we checked in and again after we checked out. Furthermore the breakfast was a lovely surprise, offering a selection of breads, jams, spreads etc. in a lovely ,sunny room decorated with plants.The room was good value and every effort had been made to make visitors welcome, for example with a fan, a fridge and a TV.The hotel is located in a historic part of Amsterdam within walking distance of the station and many museums and attractions.My husband and I will definitely stay here again and next time we will bring our daughter and try a family room. We have already recommended this hotel to friends and family since our return this morning because of its lovely location and kind and friendly staff.

<Content>Highly recommended (with reservations - no pun intended) Arriving for the first time at this hotel your heart sinks (well, mine did, despite the positive reviews). From the exterior, it is unprepossessing - the narrow front door entrance is shoe-horned between a sewing machine shop (they still exist!) and a lighting establishment, with a protruding sign reminiscent of the Seventies. You press a buzzer to be let in and you are faced with a veritable Matterhorn of narrow, steep steps up to Reception. But, hey, this is Amsterdam, and that's how they made their houses. So either you will hate it already and wish you had booked a modern, purpose built, characterless concrete rectangle somewhere, or you will love it for its characterful, traditional appeal. I loved it.The Nadia occupies several floors of a sweeping crescent terrace, built circa 1890 and once elegant, but in need of the refurbishment currently underway. In its early days, part of it was used by the royal palace on Dam square, a few minutes walk away, to house its servants. At other times, it provided apartments for well-to-do middle class Amsterdamers, and had an array of useful shops at street level 鈥?one of which (no, not the computer outlet) still exists.Once you have scaled the entrance steps, you will more than likely be greeted by the owner himself manning the Reception desk who will offer a welcoming drink from the chill cabinet, proffer maps and guides and useful info, and, if your room isn鈥檛 ready, suggest you wait in the bright, airy and welcoming breakfast room along the corridor, overlooking the street below on one side and canal on the other and bedecked with plants and flowers.Judging by the brochure, the rooms are varied and quirky. I鈥檇 booked a twin for single occupancy, which had a (smallish) double bed and (child-sized) single bed. It was at the rear, looking out onto other apartments but suited me fine, especially as it was blissfully quiet, apart from the non-intrusive quarter-hour gentle bonging of a nearby church clock.With full occupancy of a (slim) couple and (well behaved) child it would have been a squeeze, with definitely no leeway for swinging a cat, especially in the toilet/shower-room which was definitely one person standing room only, but for a three-day stay (which, I鈥檇 guess is the average for most people visiting Amsterdam), it would be bearable for a two-and-a-half person family, and, erm, cosy for a couple. Think twice about demanding a room with a view 鈥?there could be traffic noise from the street below. Breakfasts at the Nadia are what you would expect from a typical Dutch hotel 鈥?croissants, a variety of breads and confitures, cold meats and cheese, coffee and a choice of teas 鈥?all help yourself, but with the lady of the establishment on hand in the adjacent kitchen. Anybody wanting eggs and bacon and hashbrowns and suchlike should opt for a concrete rectangle place鈥?br/>Apart from its welcoming atmosphere, cleanliness and quiet, the joy of the Nadia is its perfectly located central position 鈥?twixt Central Station and Rembrandt Square, and the Red Light District (should you wish its dubious delights) and the architectural jewels of the Westerkerk Jordaan quarter. Everywhere else is either walkable or easily accessed by tram, bus, or canal bus, or, if you must, wobbly (depending on your ability) bicycle. My reservations? Definitely not suitable for the infirm or anyone with mobility problems (as are many other Amsterdam hotels with walk-up, steep stairs), and, judged entirely on my own room, not suitable for the claustrophobic or any couple not on the best of terms鈥?And the lack of air conditioning could be a distinct drawback on hot nights (although my room had a fan strategically placed pointing at the bed. I wondered if the Red Light establishments had such luxury 鈥?I didn鈥檛 find out). Otherwise 鈥?10 out of 10 鈥?especially at the price鈥?br/>(PS: Bath mat, please, before my return visit!) (PPS: Beware Amsterdam taxi drivers. I was overcharged on arrival and short-changd on departure. They should be ashamed.)

<Content>Nadia hotel--excellent choice I chose this hotel based on other positive TripAdvisor reviews and they were accurate. The price is great for the value, especially considering it also comes with continental breakfast (nicely served in a sunny breakfast room). The hotel is in a very good location--a minute from excellent public transportation connections and also next to a pretty canal, and within comfortable walking distance of many areas. The room was small but pleasant and comfortable, and the staff were all very welcoming and helpful. I recommend it highly--just be aware there is a steep flight of stairs to get to the lobby if you have any mobility issues. (Luggage isn't a problem, they are happy to carry it for you.)

<Content>What a welcome! Have just returned from a short break in Amsterdam, staying in the Nadia Hotel. We have rarely encountered such friendly welcoming staff who really made our visit memorable. Five minutes after we checked in Flowers were delivered to our room with a welcome card - really nice touch.You might not get the same high class amenities that are offered in some of the bigger chains, but if you want to stay somewhere that makes you feel at home from the moment that you walk in the door, then this is the place for you. Personal service and a warm welcoming smile, coupled with unique rooms devoid of any uniformity make this a place to remember - I'd have no hesitation recommending it to anyone...

<Content>Brilliant again for the 21st stay My 21st stay at the nadia was again brilliant. I will not choose another hotel in this great city. They are helpful, friendly. The rooms are spottless and the location is ideal for all the usual sites. I will be back soon.I had freinds who decided to come last minute and they were able to accommodate at very short notice in this busy season.... I want to thank them again for this.

<Content>Very Helpful! What a great find! The staff was so helpful with our luggage, we actually got in trouble for carrying it up the stairs ourselves! They were also helpful when the airport shuttle drove right past us. The Manager called and made them send a special car to come and get us!The room has everything you need (including fresh flowers!). Obviously it's small, you're in Europe afterall, but really who spends time in their room while on vacation! We had a room with a balcony and I recommend splurging on it! At night we bought a bottle of wine and sat on the balcony watching the sunset on the Westerkerk.Highly recommend it!

<Content>We can't wait to go back! My friend and I spent four nights at the Nadia and have just got home. We had an amazing time in Amsterdam and loved staying at this very friendly, very quaint hotel. The prices are extremely reasonable, the rooms are very clean and have fantastic showers and the breakfast coffee (I don't do solids before noon g) was great. The location is also ideal - two minutes from the Jordaan, five minutes to Dam Square, ten minutes to Leidseplein and Vondel etc. But I think best of all were the lovely lovely staff who couldn't do enough for us. Recommended with no reservations and like the title says, we can't wait to go back.

<Content>Lovely staff We have just returned form a 3 night stay at Hotel Nadia. The staff at this hotel are exceptional, friendly and hospitable with nothing being too much trouble. We were provided with 6 complimentary beers in the fridge upon arrival and were also given complimentary drinks by the manager on our last evening there.The breakfast was lovely, fresh coffee, orange juice, croissants etc.We stayed in room (208) it was extremely small and after 3 nights felt claustrophobic. Although the room was clean the bathroom tiles were grubby with black mould growing on the grout between them.The stairs leading to reception are extremely steep but we were aware of this before we booked.The hotel is central to all amenities, 10 min walk from the train station and 5 mins to Anne Franks house and Dam square.

<Content>Rather disappointing The rooms were very small don't be fooled by website as all done with wide angled lens. It was clean but not nicely decorated and the breakfast was terrible. However the staff were very helpful and friendly. Won't be rushing back there although we loved Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent Nadia Hotel! I have just come back from Amsterdam, staying two nights at the Nadia Hotel, travellng with a friend. The hotel was recommended to me and in turn I can't recommend this hotel highly enough, a big thanks to Osam and his team for making us feel so welcome and comfortable. The service was exceptional with nothing too much trouble; help was cheerfully given even when the staff were obviously very busy attending to other guests as well. The hotel is in a central location, great for exploring Amsterdam on foot, very close to the Anne Frank House and a short walk to Dam Square. The room was immaculate and also had a lovely view of the canal. Yes, the stairs are steep, but this is typical of Amsterdam and staff are on hand to help with luggage. I think you'd be hard placed to find a more friendly place to stay, thanks again to the team at the Nadia Hotel for making this visit such a memorable one.

<Content>Fabulous Stay at The Nadia Hotel We have just got back from 3 days at the Nadia, it was a great place to stay. The room was small, the stairs were steep but so what. The staff were the friendliest i have ever met in the world. We are both Airline Cabin Crew so used to supposedly good service as we stay in excellent hotels throughout the world HOWEVER you will NOT beat the service of Osam and his staff. I arrived to be welcomed by a lovely drink and then had a beautiful bouquet delivered to my room with welcome to the Nadia Hotel on it. I bought it back to England to show my friends as it was so nice. The staff cannot do enough for you, the location of the hotel is fantastic we could walk to all the attractions of Amsterdam.So if you are wanting to stay in Amsterdam you can do no better than stay at the Nadia. A warm welcome awaits you there. we will certainly be back. Thank you Osam for our wonderful stay.Gill and Jon

<Content>5 night at the Nadia Hotel My family and I stayed at the Nadia Hotel 5 nights during last June.It was a very pleasant stay.The Hotel is located in a very good location,5 minutes from the Dam Square.Moreover,under it you can find a Tram station,so you can travel in the city without any problem.The hotel's facilities are in great condition,Our room was comfortable,very clean,the bathroom is might small but, it was clean and convenient. The breakfast was edible for Continental one.There are many hotels in Amsterdam,however,I am sure few have such a friendly and fine stuff like in Nadia Hotel. The stuff always willing to assist you and to direct you to Amsterdam's attractions.Finally, you might read about the stairs,I think that people with average health can handle it without any problem.I am sure will return to it.Johnny

<Content>Great central location, friendly hosts If you enjoy clean rooms, friendly staff, and courteous service you'll love the Nadia Hotel. Yes, my room was small(It was a single), and the stairs are steep, but that's part of the adventure. Osam and his staff where friendly and helpful... even offering a bottle of water or a soda at no charge if it looked like you needed it! It's centrally located near the Anne Frank House and right on a Tram line. The breakfast room is a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee and watch the traffic and bicyclists. I recommend it highly.

<Content>great location, lovely staff Excellent location (in the lovely Jordaan district) and very friendly and obliging staff. The room was v. small but fine for my needs and had been recently refurbished. Breakfast was good, although the breakfast room was quite cramped. As with many Amsterdam Hotels - there is a steep staircase and lots of steps! But I would certainly recommend the Hotel Nadia

<Content>Great for small people! Great location... by the canals, shopping and restaurants. Perfect for a small budget. A very long and narrow flight of stairs to get to the front desk. My room was VERY small, but I was alone and I am a small person, so it was okay for me. They had a TV and a small bed. The breakfast is good and in a lovely dining room overlooking a pretty canal. The owners were wonderful... they knew I was alone, gave me great advice and greeted me excitedly when I arrived back to the hotel at night! They were very gracious.

The breakfast of breads, cheese, jams, hot drinks and juice is good too. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone staying in Amsterdam. The staff are great and very helpful.

<Content>Enjoyable Stay We stayed for one night (July 3-4) at Nadia Hotel. We visited Amsterdam on July 3 and then left on July 4 to the Duinreserve (a lovely national park situated between Amsterdam and Alkmaar). Our stay at Nadia Hotel was an enjoyable one. As most other reviewers have noted, the staff were extremely friendly and the price, although well beyond average price for a 2 star hotel in the Netherlands, seems to be a norm in Amsterdam. The hotel is conveniently situated close to all attractions. The rooms are a bit tiny but the big windows openeing to the canal may remedy that (we got a canal-side room). One thing that may make a bad impression at arrival is the very steep staircase (typical Dutch) right at the entrance (leading to the reception) and the very narrow corridor to the rooms but overall, I was satisfied with the hotel and the rooms. The breakfast was ok; there was no milk, cereals or eggs but I guess you could order milk. You should also ask the waitress to toast your bread, if you want some. I was hearing the lady suggesting to another group of guests to buy some eggs and she could keep them in the firdge and cook them for their breakfast. All in all, there is not much luxury in Nadia Hotel but it has a very pleasant atmosphere.

<Content>Great hotel, better staff! We stayed for three days during our honeymoon and had a great time. The room, like most in Amsterdam, was very small but the little space was put to very good use with shelves and hooks in every corner and the fridge over the bed!Because of the lack of space I would recommend booking a room with a balcony.The entrance stairs to this hotel are steep but the very friendly and helpful staff will carry your luggage.In all, a good little hotel in a central location but it is the staff and the little touches (like a welcome soft drink and the congratulatory flowers we received) that makes this one special.

<Content>Kudos to Nadia Hotel We stayed at the Nadia 1 night before we went on Safari and then another 2 nights on return. They not only stored some of our luggage, but also had a Welcome Home bouquet for us on our return from Africa. The manager and his staff are extremely friendly and helpful and make every attempt to make your stay in Amsterdam memorable. The location is great with a bus and tram stop less than a block away. Many rooms face the canal. We were in Room 413 which was delightful. Breakfast is included and is in a bright, airy flower-filled room; coffee and tea service are provided in your room. Even though this is a budget hotel, it is clean and is a great value, with many amenities. Yes, there are steep steps, but they provide much needed exercise for most of us. (There is always someone there to take your luggage up and down from street level.)

<Content>Really Friendly, Clean Hotel Mum and I stayed for two nights end of May this year. The owners and staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. I even recieved an e-mail from them when I got back home making sure I had arrived safely - how nice is that?The only down side is the stairs in the hotel. They are extremely steep and lots of them!! I would recommend this hotel to anyone able to negotiate the stairs and will stay there again when I next visit Amsterdam.

<Content>Nadia Hotel; home from home The Nadia Hotel is about the most friendly and comfortable place you can find. Osam the manager and his staff are always cheerful and the hotel, in a beautiful period building, is perfectly placed for access to the city centre.The rooms are small but with a canal view or a balcony its perfect. We have stayed at the Nadia three times and at our last visit, when we arrived we had flowers in our room with a 'welcome home' message.. That says it all! We love the Nadia and you will not find a better deal in central Amsterdam.

<Content>Very small but pefectly formed Alhough the Hotel is fairly clean and friendly it is very small afteryou have climbed many steps to the reception area. The rooms are alsotiny and have a strange layout because they have obviously been converted from larger rooms. The breakfast room is again quite small and does not offer much other than bread/cheese/croissants/orange juice/coffeee/tea. I found it weird that there was not any cereal or fruit to eat.If you like your bed to be hard then you are in luck, my back will bear testiment to that. My partner and I found our selves having to breathe in to pass each other in the room and to get in and out of the shower room also. Nice people but frankly I would never return to this hotel to stay again.

<Content>Good place to stay I stayed at the Nadia for a week (May - June 2007), in a double room with street-side balcony.GOOD POINTS: EMPLOYEES - Very courteous, always willing to help, including ordering food, giving directions, or anything that will make your stay more enjoyable. Absolutely professional and friendly! LOCATION - The hotel is only a 15 minute walk (5 minutes by bike) from the Red Light District, a 5 minute walk from the Anne Frank House. Major tram stop is less than 5 minutes away. SECURITY - Everyone who enters the building must be buzzed in by the front desk, and they have cameras all over the hotel. So no riff-raff hanging around inside, like some of the seedier hostels!BAD POINTS BREAKFAST - Left something to be desired...croissants, juice and coffee is about all you get. Also, breakfast is only served until 1030...if you party late and then sleep in, you'll probably miss it altogether. ROOM SIZE - The pictures on the website are misleading, as they shot them with a wide-angle camera...they are TINY! Not to be graphic, but if you are on the toilet with the bathroom door closed, your knees are hitting the door! I understand that tiny rooms are the norm in Amsterdam, but you will still be shocked when you see it! VISITORS - I'd like to see the no visitors rule softened...if you want someone to visit you in your room, they have to be a paying hotel customer to enter!

<Content>A cozy well located hotel While I would not recommend the Nadia to anyone who is handicapped (very long and steep staircase), hotel prices are high in Amsterdam, and this was one of the better priced 2 star hotels. The rooms were small but clean and well appointed (including fans, which helped when it got hot), and the staff vere very friendly and attentive. We booked directly through their web site, and they responded promptly each time. When we arrived for our return stay of our round trip through Amsterdam, there were flowers in the room and a nice note. The breakfast is basic but adequate. The location is superb, right in the Jordaans district. For the price, I would definitely stay there again, but recommend a room without a view, as they are quieter. Amie Rodnick

<Content>Great value for price Stayed here twice in one week (flying into/out of Amsterdam) and found it to be great value. 1st room was quite small and difficult to move around for 2 people but the 2nd room had a lot more space. They were also doing rehab/improving some rooms. Very clean, great staff, friendly and perfectly placed to visit all that Amsterdam offers. If you want somewhere clean, good value and convenient then this is perfect and I would certainly return.

<Content>Good location - very small room The room was VERY small and bathroom L-shaped with the floor of the toilet and shower a few inches below the floor where the sink was. When you showered, therefore, the floor was also wet around the toilet. Upon arrival, the door was locked, and we later found out that you had to push the buzzer to gain entrance. Only a steep flight of stairs faces you with the reception area at the top. The friendliness and helpfulness of the owner made up for these disappointments. The small dining room was open in the evenings which helped as there was no lobby to sit in. It was straight to your room, otherwise, or stay out until you were ready to turn in. To its credit, the hotel was in an excellent location, 5 mins. from Dam Square. It is around the corner from the Ann Frank House and the Westerkerk church, the latter being seen from our small bal-cony.

<Content>loved it Just arrived back from a 4 day trip to Amsterdam and loved every minute of it.Booked the hotel due to previous reviews on trip advisor and wouldn't change my decision for the world.Yes there are steep stairs BUT they are do-able. I'm 12 weeks pregnant and we were on the top floor so had over 70 steps to climb each day,but it keeps you fit. Plus the view makes it worthwhile. You probably only climb them 2-3 times a day, keeps the calories off after trying out the pancakes and other delights Amsterdam has to offer. Must say when the hotel found out I was expecting they did offer me a room on the first floor but we stuck to our original room.They also had a lovely bouquet of flowers waiting in our room for my partners 30th birthday. Yet another lovely touch.The location is excellent. About a 5 minute walk to Dam Square, 2 min walk to Anne Franks House and a 10 min walk to Liedsplein. Everywhere within walking distance.Our room was small but great. Had room to unpack and store our clothes. Also a Balcony, double bed, shower etc. Breakfast was simple but enough to start you off for the day and keep you going til Lunch.The staff are lovely. Able to offer advice on places to see, restaurants to try out etc.Would recommend this hotel without hesitation

<Content>A great hotel at a bargain proce This is a great tlittle hotel and don't let the stairs put you off - you can stop halfway for a breather and anyway, all little hotels in Amsterdam are like this!The welcome was friendly and we were offered a drink from the chiller cabinet as we booked in. The room was compact but the best thing was the bed - probably even more comfortable than my own bed at home.The location is great, really central but quiet and peaceful. The staff were very friendly and even advised us on local transport. The place was very clean and although the breakfast was basic (cereal and croissants) it was adequate to set you up for a wander around this great city. I'd certainly stay there again - really good quality and good value too.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Great Location and Staff We went to Amsterdam as part of a whirlwind honeymoon tour of Europe and by the time we got to Amsterdam we were pretty much exhausted and ready for a mellower city. Hotel Nadia was a quick 10 minute tram ride from Centraal Station on the number 13, and 17 lines. It's within walking distance of the Dam, and around the corner from the Anne Frank House. We arrived at 8:30 am, and our room wasn't ready, also we found out that Hotels.com had us in two beds (not what we wanted for our honeymoon), so they said they would keep our luggage, and to come back about 1pm and they would try to get us a room with a double bed. Yes the stairs are VERY steep, but the inside of the hotel is very nice, the rooms are not large, but they are clean and comfortable. We were given a nice room with a balcony and a double bed, with a bouquet of flowers that said welcome honeymooners very nice touch! They were very courteous and kind to us. Will definitely stay here again!

<Content>Compact to say the least! I was really chuffed to have found a hotel so central and in our favourite part of Amsterdam, the Jordaan. On arriving, we were a little disappointed to find that the road outside was quite a main one and that our requested canal view required us to lean a little over the balcony to catch a glimpse. The room was pretty small but it was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable after a day schlepping round the 'Dam. In fact it came to grow on us throughout the weekend and the bathroom door bumping onto the bed became a bit of a running joke! The staff at Nadia were very friendly and made us feel like we were at home abroad. The location couldn't be any more central and only metres away from the peace and tranquility of Herengracht and a stack of wonderful bars and restaurants.My overall advice would be to stay if you want something relatively cheap and cheerful but if you have an issue with steep stairs you may want to reconsider!

<Content>Great accomodation in the heart of amsterdam Hotel Nadia was a great palace to stay in amsterdam.The rooms were great, very clean and cosy,the staff were very friendly and really cooperative.They found out all the information we needed for sights and other things,the breakfast was very good(croissants,cake,toasted bread),the manager had a great sense of humour and treated us with drinks on arrival and departure,We were two young couples and we had a great time there.Finally the hotel was very close to everywhere,imagine that we used the tram only once from van ghaugh museum because of the heavy rain,apart from that we walked to the rest of the amsterdam very easily.Thank you very much for the pleasant stay.we recommend it to you without second thoughts

<Content>Steeper than you think! stayed at The Nadia for a couple of nights on business. To be fair I did know about the stairs but they really are a killer, especially after a couple of drinks..Also, there is no airconditioning and my room got uncomfortably warm.However, its cheap and cheerful and in a great location. The hotels website is very honest about the a/c, stairs etc so you do know what you will be getting.

<Content>Great Weekend Break Hotel Nadia is a great friendly warm hotel, from the time you arrive the staff are so friendly. When you first arrive you may feel a bit down hearted by the look of the front of the hotel and then when you get buzzed in your faced with these steep set of stairs but all you can do is laugh but this just adds to the quaint character of this hotel. On check in I joked about having to climb any more sets of stairs when the manager Osman (a lovely helpful man) asked us to wait in the breakfast room for our room but we didn't realise he had change or room from upstairs to reception level which was great.When we got to our room it was right next door to the breakfast room but we had no disturbances any morning considering we didn't wake any morning till 11o'clock as the beds were so comfy.I had also mentioned on booking that it was my husband's birthday, and in our room was a bouquet of flowers which we thought was a lovely touch.Throughout the weekend any staff we met were so friendly to us which is good as this adds to the enjoyment of your stay.I would recommend this hotel for all type of travelers. I would look forward to staying with all the staff at this GREAT hotel.

<Content>Great value Reasonably priced, friendly/helpful staff, good croissants, clean room, quiet and excellent location. Plus, free WiFi available in room. A potential negative for some: Reception is on third floor at top of steep flight of stairs; porter carries bags, you hike.

<Content>Great Location, friendly staff! We were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Amsterdam is VERY walkable for those that are fairly good walkers! ROOMS: Very small but cute and some rooms have balcony's, we really liked this feature, originally we had a room without a balcony and the staff offered to show us another room (which we didn't ask for, but was nice of them and we preferred the room with the balcony)! Bed was small, and space in the rooms was at a premium, bathroom was also small with one of the tiniest sinks I have ever seen, even in Europe. Rooms and hotel were clean and well maintained. Most channels on TV were in English with Dutch subtitles which was nice.BREAKFAST: The breakfast room was small but quaint. croissants, coffee, tea, orange juice, bread, cheese. It was adequate for our needs. The breakfast room has a little balcony that overlooks an intersection and canal.STAIRS: The hotel is on the upper floors of a building, you have to be buzzed in but the desk is staffed 24hours. The stairs leading up the hotel are intimidatingly steep, but they ask you to leave your bags on the first level and they we bring them to your room.The hotel is within two blocks of the Anne Frank house and three or four blocks of Dam Square. We were happy with the location and the hotel was quiet, we would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Weekend break Good things were: Staff all friendly and welcoming. Very good location (eg tram stop nearby and easy walking distance to Anne Frank's house and other sights). Complimentary soft drinks. Early check-in. Luggage stored safely on our departure day.Minor concerns were: Our room was tiny and no drawer space, however it had a good view of the canal and the Westerkerk. Breakfast had limited choice, however it was adequate.Overall, good value for money.

<Content>Hotel Nadia Hotel Nadia is lovely - the staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean (as a family, we had the 'quad' which was a bit of a squeeze but the beds were very comfortable and plenty of cupboard space). The steep stairs might put some people off. The dining room is also small and tables were not always available for breakfast. Also the central location meant that traffic noise (and church chimes!) were noticeable. But walking distance of many places and right near Ann Frank Museum. Would stay there again.

<Content>So friendly.... Just come back from staying three nights at the Hotel Nadia - and we had a great stay. The hotel is in an excellent location and very near a tram stop so it is easy to get everywhere (and are in walking distance of most many of the places you are going to want to visit).The hotel couldn't be friendlier and we felt very welcome - and loved the fresh flowers in the room. It was this friendiness that made our stay special.The room wasn't big (although we had a nice canal view) - but it was comfortable and certainly had all we needed. Breakfast was included - would perhaps have liked a little more variety but that is just being picky!The stairs (which have been mentioned) do look rather daunting - but aren't as bad as they look!I would recommend tis hotel because of it's location, cleanliness and above all its friendliness.

<Content>What a special place! For the first time in 10 years we were going away without the children,and the Nadia Hotel,Amsterdam was to be our home for 4 days.Booking online via the hotel website was easy and there was always a prompt and thorough response to any enquiries.We were slightly daunted by the prospect of all THOSE stairs but,hey,they say exercise is good for you!!!On arrival at the hotel our fist impression wascan this ordinary looking front door in amongst a row of shops really be our hotel entrance?But,on that door being opened and seeing THOSE stairs we knew this was it!Our bags were carried up for us by a very friendly chap,and as we entered the reception we were greeted with a very warm welcome from Osam and his receptionist who immediately offered us a drink on the house.After a short while relaxing in the breakfast room we were directed to our room,which was small and basic,but was clean,comfortable,en-suite and had a lovely view of the canal and church.Having a fridge in the room was good for keeping the Heineken chilled(recommend anyone to do the Heineken Experience,great fun!)Also,satellite tv was provided which included BBC so we even watched Eastenders and match of the day!We also had tea/coffee facilities.Breakfast was a simple selection of continental usuals-croissants,jam,cake,bread,cheese,coffee,tea,juice.All self service so you could fill up before heading out and about.Osam and his staff were all so friendly and helpful we almost immediately felt as though we had known them for years(this feeling was only reinforced when on my birthday,the day after we retuned home,a message was left on our answer phone wishing me a happy birthday from all at the Nadia!)Their advice was a key factor in our ability to see and do so much in the short time we were in Amsterdam.The Hotels central location combined with the wonderful staff made this,in our opinion,the perfect accomodation.Try it for yourself-you'll love it too :-)

<Content>A warm family! Nadia hotel made our stay in Amsterdam a wonderful experience! The location of the hotel is great, less than a 5 minute walk to Dam square and right on the Keizersgracht canal across from Westerkerk. There is a shuttle service that connects the hotel to Schiphol and the hotel staff is super available to help arrange transportation for their guests.Breakfast in the mornings is generous and the rooms are clean and cozy! Best of all, the hotel staff was super helpful from the minute we arrived. They are happy to take care of your luggage (don't let the steep flight of stairs scare you!) and they went above and beyond what was expected in their tips of what to do in the city and their hospitality throughout our stay. It really feels like you are staying with a family, and it is hard nowadays to find a hotel with such a warm atmosphere. I definitely recommend this hotel if you are staying in Amsterdam!

<Content>Average Overall, this hotel was average. First glance was scary - when the door opens and you see 2 flights of STEEP, narrow stairs. But the hotel staff was happy to take our luggage to our room.Rooms were musty and smelled of smoke - despite the non-smoking preference. Also was bothered by the lack of insulation from the ouside street. Make sure you bring eaplugs. Rooms were small, but adequate.Staff was very helpful and assisted with luggage on both arrival and departure.

<Content>Great hotel! The hotel was easy to find, just a short tram ride from Central Station and we had a very friendly welcome when we arrived and were offered a free drink. Our room was on the top floor which meant having to climb 3 steep staircases, we didn't mind but this might bother some visitors. The hotel is in a good location, just around the corner from Anne Frank's House. The breakfast was included and was sufficient. It was great to have tea and coffee facilities in our room. Overall I cannot fault this hotel and would stay there again!

<Content>VERY friendly and central located Hotel! We stayed at Nadia Hotel for 3 nights and loved it. The rooms are quite small, but as you can walk to the Rijsks- and Van Gogh Museum in about 20 Minutes and to the Central Station as well - it is very good located. We never had to take the tram to go anywhere. The rooms are small, but very clean. Breakfast ist simple, but enough, and the hotel is just tipical dutch I guess. Will be coming back for sure!

<Content>Friendly welcome at the Nadia The two of us stayed at the Nadia for 3 nights in March. The hotel is in a great location, close to Dam Square and many major tourist attractions. The staff are very friendly and the complimentary cold drink - once you have hauled your luggage up the stairs was very much appreciated. [They will be more than pleased to help if you need it]. The buffet breakfast was fine - one improvement would be a non-smoking breakfast room. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the Nadia to travellers looking for a short break in the heart of the city.

<Content>Feel at home in the Nadia Hotel I just returned from a wonderful trip to Amsterdam, many of my fondest memories include the Nadia Hotel. Our decision to book at theNadia had much to do with the competitive rates, but mostly the glowing reviews. The Nadia Hotel lived up to every wonderful thing we have read. The staff is warm, friendly and accomodating. The owner, Osam is special in his own right. He makes you feel as though you are the only guest and your happiness and comfort is his priority. He adds personal touches similar to what you would experience in a bed and breakfast. My favorite memory of Osam is being invited to the kitchenas he made me a pot of coffee 2 hours before breakfast even began. We had many fantastic conversations with Osam that again, are as memorable as Amsterdam itself.The past reviews have mentioned the stairs, yes there is a bit of a climb which before arrival, we worried about, however, the anticipation far exceeded the reality. We saw guests young, old and even disabled climb the stairs to reception - use your judgement based on your own physical capabilities.There was a specific review mentioning room 316, that it was small, dirty, with an odor. I had the PLEASURE of staying in room 316. It was cozy, bright, clean and perfect as far as Im concerned. Im confused to even read such a review. Why would anyone care if the rooms are small in a city like Amsterdam? The only quality time spent in the hotel, was not the room, it was dining in the lovely breakfast room or at reception having wonderful chats with the staff and Osam.I look forward to returning to my new second home at the Nadia Hotel.If you decide to book a reservation, I can say with certainty that you made a wise decision.

<Content>perfect little haven stayed for 2 nights at the hotel nadia and have to say i was extremely satisfied with both the accommodation and location. yes the rooms are small (we stayed in a double room with balcony) but you definetley get what you pay for. If you want to go to amsterdam and experience all the charms that this city has to offer then the hotel nadia is the perfect choice. I read the reviews before i went and had mixed signals as to how far away the hotel actually was from the square. it took approximately 5 minutes leisurely stroll to get to the square and a further 5 minutes to central station. the hotel is situated in a very nice quiet area with lots of restaurants close by. the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful and offered a nice cold coke when we arrived. Dont be put of when you see the infamous nadia stairs, theyre really not so bad and the staff are always willing to assist with your luggage, plus all the exercise meant i could have an extra cake or two!!

<Content>Number One in Amsterdam Right, where do I start鈥︹€?br/>We booked this hotel purely on the reviews on this site and not let down at all. We spent ages looking at all sorts but this was spot on. Before we left Osam (Manager) E-mailed me with the directions to the hotel from the airport and he was spot on. Once at Central take Tram 15 or 13, 3rd stop and it stops right outside the hotel. Once there we rang the buzzer and the door opened we saw 鈥?the famous stairs鈥?which aren鈥檛 that bad in all honesty. Our bags where taken to our room and we had a drink on the house :-) and given maps of the City. ( we found very useful )Our room was excellent and we had everything we could ask for. The room was spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We had a balcony, which I highly recommend and a walk in closet. The bathroom is a nice size and the shower is very powerful.We had the option of breakfast but only had this once as they stop at 11.00 (After a heavy night, the last thing you want is breakfast so we wasn鈥檛 bother that much.) The staff are very friendly and there 24 hours a day, which is reassuring. We had a bit of a mad moment with Space Cakes and Osam helped us out and I am VERY Grateful.Overall out Trip was very good but the whole Nadia Hotel Experience made it even better. We can only say positive comments about this hotel and you will NOT be disappointed.I would just like to thank Team Nadia and say a massive Thank You.

<Content>Stay in Amsterdam April 2007 The hotel Nadia is a hotel at a very good quality price level. Room is comfortable, with a nice view on the canal and Wester Mark Church. Welcome is warm. The hotel is well located in the center of Amsterdam, and not very far of Central Station. For a big family, we recommend you this hotel as it is not always easy to find a big room for a large family.Travellers from France.

<Content>Excellent hospitality Just returned from long weekend in Amsterdam (13-16Apr07). The Nadia Hotel was fantastic. Excellent and hospitable hosts!! Location is only about 5min walk to Anne Franks House, 10min to Dam Square and 20min walk to Centraal Station.Fantastic shower, especially after long days of sightseeing. Breakfast at the hotel is adequate. No complaints at all! Well recommended.

<Content>5 Star Service ;-) I recently stayed in a standard single room and was delighted with the quality of facilities. Indeed the hotel was clean and welcoming and the room was everything I hoped for and more.One great advantage of the Nadia is its location and this with the competitive price makes this hotel a great choice.The staff are invariably helpful without being intrusive and I have no doubt I will be returning soon ;-)All in all an easy hotel to recommend without reservation.Jon Clarke April 2007

<Content>Nadia is 5* in our opinion As a family of 5 we decided to spend the Easter break in Amsterdam. The Nadia hotel only added to what was a brilliant long weekend.All the Nadia staff are so nice. Osam, the manager, goes out of his way to make sure everything is perfect for you. The kids were treated like royalty and spoilt rotten with Easter eggs, drinks and genuine affection. They loved it.We had a 3rd floor family room, and yes the stairs are steep but considering the staff do all the baggage handling and steep stairs are common place in Amsterdam I don't see why people feel the need to complain!We hope to return and I know we won't be looking for anywhere else to stay. The Nadia ticks all the right boxes with it's location, outlook and above all else friendliness.Thanks for a great time.

<Content>隆Magn铆fica experiencia! Mi esposa y yo estuvimos en 脕msterdam durante 8 d铆as por trabajo. El hotel Nadia nos fue recomendado por un compa帽ero y ahora nos alegramos mucho de haber seguido su consejo.Es un establecimiento sencillo, coqueto, familiar y muy acogedor. Est谩 en un lugar c茅ntrico y se puede llegar a 茅l con facilidad andando desde la Estaci贸n Central. Nos subieron las maletas y nos obsequiaron con un refresco.Las habitaciones son peque帽as, pero muy adecuadas y a un excelente precio (nos hicieron un doble descuento por quedarnos un domingo y por pagar en efectivo, d谩ndonos todo tipo de facilidades). Disponen de TV, tel茅fono, caja fuerte, ba帽o y acceso inal谩mbrico a la interred de forma gratuita, lo que para nosostros era fundamental. De hecho tuvieron problemas con la red y verdaderamente se esforzaron por soluccionarlo inmediatamente, lo cual fue muy de agradecer.Mucho se habla en los comentarios de las famosas escaleras. Es verdad que no hay ascensor, pero las escaleras se suben bien y no hay que ser flojos. Nosotros lo tomamos como una excelente oportunidad de hacer ejercicio y les estamos muy agradecidos por ayudarnos a mejorar nuestra forma f铆sica.El desayuno abundante, sin lujos pero bueno.Algunas cr铆ticas constructivas:- tienen mucha informaci贸n de ofertas turistas, pero no conocen muchas cosas pr谩cticas de las cercan铆as. Por ejemplo, sab铆an indicarnos d贸nde pod铆amos encontrar una misa en espa帽ol o ingl茅s (a las afueras), pero no d贸nde estaba la iglesia m谩s cercana (a s贸lo una cuadra, aunque la misa fuere en holand茅s). Es decir, que no se conocen bien su propio barrio.- tienen que aprender a hablar en espa帽ol... son de estos europeos, todav铆a en el siglo XX, que todav铆a se dedican a hablar franc茅s o italiano.En resumen... una magn铆fica experiencia. Se lo recomendamos muy mucho si busca algo sencillo en 脕msterdam.隆Buen viaje!

<Content>Cheap  After reading reviews regarding this hotel I was worried and emailed the hotel to ask for a room at the front (which are meant to be bigger). On our arrival someone brought our bags up (stairs are steep) and we were given our welcome drink  shown to our rooms. It is not the Ritz but the rooms are clean  nice...TV, Fridge  Safe. The staff are very helpful and chatty! The location is brilliant  we walked everywhere. I would recommend Nadia and would stay there again when in Amsterdam

<Content>Decent, but over-priced This hotel has a great location, is clean, and there's good security with a 24-hour desk.But, it's also rather costly for the what are probably the smallest hotel rooms I've ever seen. The beds are very narrow, but decent enough. Rooms on the front street can be very noisy, especially given that some windows don't close properly.Washrooms in each of the rooms is a plus, but you pretty much need to leave the door open in order to use them in a couple of the rooms.Breakfast is rather under-whelming. None of the sliced meats, selection of cheese that we were used to in other Dutch hotels.Still, the location is worth a lot, and one does feel secure here.

<Content>Very Enjoyable Am just back from a terrific weekend in Amsterdam where we stayed 2 nights at the Nadia hotel. The hotel is very central  is perfectly placed to allow you to tackle all major sights on foot, which is exactly what you need for a w'end city break. Firstly, I really cannot say enough about the staff. They were so pleasant and so helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Secondly, The rooms are clean  functional and are grand for a short break. But they are TINY!! I cannot stress that fact enough. Fine for a couple, but we had some comical moments nontheless. Breakfast is nothing special - great coffee, bread, cheese jams etc. Not exactly hearty if a full irish is your thing! The next really remarkable thing about the hotel, is the stairs in it. You have to climb a sheer cliff face of stairs just to get to the reception. Seriously, a rope would not have gone astray. You need to have your wits about you going either up or down them and if you are in any way unable for climbing/ abseiling then this is not the hotel for you. Overall though its a good spot and a great base for a weekend in Amsterdam. Enjoy!!

<Content>Great for young couples Once you enter, it seems as though you can barely move. There's a staircase steeper than Mount Everest and has you heaving as soon as you reach the top. And there's no avoiding it since the front office is adjacent to the top of the staircase. However, don't assume your stay will be uncomfortable as the entrance because it's not. The rooms are wonderful if your are traveling as a couple. The employees are more than nice and will answer any question you have, especially ones regarding where certain locations are. And when I say they are nice people, don't just take that as something menial. It really makes a difference when the people who look after your stuff and clean your room do it in a very professional fashion. I stayed in Amsterdam for 3 days and enjoyed every second in the hotel. Although, the city is great and barely spent much time in the hotel.

<Content>Great for couples The staff was very friendly and helpful. We asked them for suggestions for places to eat, etc and took their advice and each time were not disappointed. The rooms are small but had everything we needed. I suggest to get a room with a balcony, great view of westermarket and canal. Breakfast was nice, croissants, breads, and cakes. Also, tea and coffee. But to stay here you must be able to walk up a lot of steep stairs. It was a great couple of days, loved the staff!

<Content>Fabulous, friendly, and perfect location I just returned from my second stay at the Nadia and once again my stay there was AWESOME!!!!! I can't say enough good things about the Nadia. Very pleasant staff, made me at home. Fresh flowers in my room to greet me. This time my husband was not able to come on this trip but, I felt very safe and secure. When reading some of the reviews that others have written they complain about the steep stairs and small rooms but, that is the way the city is. All of the hotels that do not have elevators have steep stairs, so what, just a little extra exercise. The rooms and bathrooms might be small but, I don't know about you but how much time does one stay in the room when on vacation.? Small bathroom, yeah but, who cares. The friendliness and outstanding service make up for it all in end. I will not stay anywhere else when visiting Amsterdam. And it is in the perfect location easy access to anything you will want to do.

<Content>4th time around Me and my boyfriend have made amsterdam a yearly break and we always stay at the Nadia. Its perfect for us!Dam square is a 10 minute walk away ( a lady never rushes! ) and its on an easy to find road - this is a bonus when its your first time in amsterdam and you've got lost and your trying to find your hotel. Its round the corner from the anne Frank house and there is a canal bus stop opposite- bonus!The staff are friendly and there is always someone at the desk. The stairs are really steep to get up to the hotel so i wouldnt suggest going there if you have a disability or have troubles with stairs.The rooms are clean. Small but cosy. They are en suite and the bathroos are also small but again clean, and the shower doesnt trickle. The double beds are huge and really comfy and you have a safety deposit box, a fridge and a TV in your room. You also have tea facilities in your room, and as every self respecting brit knows a good cup of tea at the end of a long day is well appreciated. Breakfast is served in a quaint little room with a view over the canal and the church. You have a choice of juice, tea, coffee, croissants, bread, toast, cheese, cakes and jams. Its not a full english, but its continental and adds to the experience of a european break.I could not fault this hotel and could not ask for more from a hotel- its safe, friendly, clean, cosy, reasonably priced in an excellent location - i would highly recomend it.

<Content>Excellent Hotel II have just got back from my 3rd trip to Amsterdam and felt compelled to write in. i have stayed in the Nadia Hotel all 3 times i have visited and i cannot say a bad word about it. The staff are lovely and very helpful, the hotel and rooms are clean and well maintained. the rooms themsleves are quite small but i never expect anything less over there as most places are small with steep staircases anyway! we asked for a balcony and we got one too.it is right the the heart of everything-dam square, red light district, anne franks house, museums and maddame tussauds are all within easy walking distance. the breakfast at the hotel is continentil so we didnt bother with that cuz we just wanted our full english but it looked good nethertheless. oh and it is very cold in feb/march so wrap up warm!cant wait to go back!

<Content>fantastic secure hotel Hello all,This is probably one of the best hotels in the city. First the front door has cameras on it and is manned 24/7 ( so no idiots trying to get in at all hours). The staff come and collect your bags so you don't have to tackel the stairs with them . The welcome is the friendlist we have ever had (and we have been to Amsterdam on several occasions and stayed in a diffrent hotel every time). So it is not the RITZ but you get a lovely clean room, secure and staffed 24/7 .The breakfast is a typical continenetal breakfast and the location is 3mins from Dam Square behined the palace and yet there is no noise to inferfear with your sleeping or other activerties. The flower market is 10 mins in one direction and the red light area is 10 mins in the other direction.We have already inquired about a reservation in November . We will be returning to this hotel and i would urge you all to try this hotel too.

<Content>Very friendly but disappointed I found the Nadia staff very friendly and helpful but I must admit I was a bit disappointed with the hotel and my room. The room was very small and I did think it was overpriced. The breakfast was only ok. The hotel is in a good location however be prepared for very steep steps - I don't think I could bring my Mum!The whole place felt a bit 'cramped'.

<Content>genuinely friendly sum up - great little hotel 5 min from damm square, and most other attractions on foot. very friendly staffon arrivial we couldnt believe the flight of stairs although one on the friendly staff was at hand to take our bags. the lady at the desk was very nice and gave my partner and i, and another couple a quick induction to the hotel, the facilities and a map and city guide book to get us going. although it was 11am and check-in wasnt ment to be until 2pm, she invited us to the breakfast room where we were served tea and coffee for 20 min while they cleaned and prepared a room for us which had an early check-out. . .a benefit of going to a small hotel. our room was small (make that very small) but very clean also. the size wasnt an issue due to amsterdam having so much to do and see..anyone who uses there room for anything other than a wash and a sleep is in the wrong city. what really made the difference for me was when leaving at night to go out for the evening was the staff telling us to have a pleasant evning and the staff always being more than happy to help with directions and advice on everything we asked.all in all a great trip and i cant wait to go back. would highly reccomend for value -for-money.

<Content>Friendly and Helpful Nadia Hotel Myself and five others have just returned from a long weekend in Amsterdam staying at the Hotel Nadia. I found it by surfing around and the Hotel fit the bill. On arrival we were more than impressed by the friendliness of the staff and a welcome drink was waiting for us before we unpacked.The Hotel is on a Bed and Breakfast basis, the breakfast room overlooking one of the lovely canals. The Hotel is nicely situated not far from Dam Square and all attractions were easily accessable from the Hotel. But if you do not like walking, a tram stop is situated just opposite and very handy for anywhere in the City.We enquired several times for the location of different places and each time the staff on duty were extremely helpful and we were directed the best way to get to the destinations and therefore made our holiday stress free.The stairs were steep (as in all of Amsterdam's hotels) and there was no lift - BUT this did not deter us and was not a problem. In any case staff were on call at all times to help, should you need it, to take your luggage or bags up and down the stairs.I would throughly recommend Hotel Nadia to anyone planning a stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>WHAT A LET DOWN! I booked this hotel because of the good reviews it has on this sight and I ended up extremley dissapointed!!Yes the location is very good and yes the staff are friendly (which you should expect at a hotel anyway!), but the hotel isn't anything special. I had done my research before we arrived and i was expecting a small room and steep staircases. But the rooms aren't just small they are TINY. We had a room at the back of the hotel and you could actually stretch your arms out and touch the walls on each side. The bathroom was even smaller. I dont consider myself to be fussy but these rooms shouldn't be commissioned by the hotel as they are unbearable. I would have struggled to feel comfortable if i had stayed in the room alone because of the size, but with my boyfriend in there too we were constantly bumping into eachother. We couldnt be moved as the hotel was fully booked. We caught a glimpse of rooms at the front of the hotel when the maid was cleaning and they looked much bigger and much more comfortable so maby we were very unlucky. Advice for future guests AVOID ROOM 316.Also a horrible smell kept wafting from the bathroom, like sewage/ drains. It was like we could smell poo coming from the toilet when it hadn't been used! Not very nice. I wouldn't say that the hotel was particulaly clean either, the bin in our room was still full with the lasts guests rubbish when we arrived and the sheets looked as through they had been used since the 1970's. The hotel smelled a bit musty, it wasn't filthy but I think the standards could be improved. I wouldn't reccommend this hotel, and I wouldn't go again. Amsterdam on the other hand was brilliant and we will return.

<Content>Lovely Hotel and well placed within Amsterdam City Centre We have just arrived back after staying for 3 nights in Hotel Nadia. Hotel Nadia is nicely placed within the city as everything is within easy reach and a short distance away whether you choose to get there on foot, canal bus or tram. The staff are more than helpful and are always on hand for anything you may need (in my case, an iron, an adapter plug and the use of the microwave at 11.30pm). The rooms are slightly on the small side but the balcony overlooking the canal more than made up for the lack of space inside. The rooms are very clean and have everything you need. (ensuite, tea and coffee facilities, safe, tv). There is only one downside to this hotel and that is the amount of stairs we had to climb, we were on the top floor and had 4 flights of stairs to climb, BUT.... at least it kept us fit!

<Content>Excellent Value for Money Stayed for two nights Feb. 7th and 8th. Previously stayed in 2001. The welcoming atmosphere was exceptional, and despite the formidible stairs, staff helped carry luggage to the room. Room was small, but had all the features required for a comfortable stay. Why would anyone want to stay in their room, except to sleep anyway? Breakfast was a delight, with a warm, comfortable atmosphere.Won't hesitate to recommend to anyone, and staff are to be complimented on their friendly and helpful assistance.

<Content>Small but great We just stayed at the Nadia Hotel. While it is very small, we really enjoyed our stay. The staff was extremely friendly, the rooms were clean and it was quiet. This was our first trip to Amsterdam and we felt extremely lucky to end up in the neighborhood we did. We found several fabulous places to eat and did a good amount of shopping. We would stay again and would recommend it to friends (as long as they understand that the rooms are small). Oh and the staircase -- it is so tall and steep (which they warn you about on their website) that I laughed everytime I saw it. It is wise to take them up on their offer to carry your bag to your room.

<Content>Excellent My husband and I have stayed at the Nadia twice and it has been a great experience both times. The location is perfect, close to all places of interest but far enough away from thre rip -off areas. The staff are very helpful and friendly (giving you a can of coke when you arrive is a welcome touch especially if you have walked from the train station at top speed). The rooms vary, some are small, but on our most recent trip in Feb 2007 we were given an upgrade to a room with a canal view which was stunning. I would highly recommend this hotel for value, convenience and romance. Breakfasts were good too.

<Content>small rooms and even smaller bathrooms When we arrived at the hotel the first thing that strikes you is the staircase that leads to the reception on the first floor. Certainly not for the unfit but after your stay you would be fitter from climbing the stairs. The staff were helpful and friendly and offered us a cold drink from the fridge on our arrival. We were then showen to our rooms, and had the second shock of the day.....the room! To say the room was small would be an understatement, I dont tink I have ever stayed in a smaller one. The third shock was the bathroom. It was so small that I was unable to wash without hitting my head on the shelf over the sink. Im sure it would make the Guinness Book of Records! Apart from all of that the room was spotless and cleaned everyday. It had everything you would need i.e phone, t.v, safety deposit box, small fidge etc....The location of the hotel itself was brilliant. It is two minutes from Dam Squareand two minutes from Anne Frank's house. All the tourists spots were within walkingdistance, we never had to use trams or taxis. We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam and will return again but unfortunatley not to stay at the Naida.

<Content>Wouldn't recommend it! I stayed in this hotel at the end of January. On the plus side, the location is excellent and the staff are helpful. The downside is that the room we had was extremely small, dark and dingy - I asked if we could change rooms but the hotel was fully booked. I have also unfortunately managed to catch scabies which is highly unpleasant. I have stayed in many hotels and can say that this is the worst one ever - I would definitely not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Nadia Never Again, Not Even for Free I stayed her for 3 nights and apart from a central location and a cheap price I ended up with scabies for months.Beware as it seems to me it is infested by bugs. Also apart from having a fridge and tv the bathroom was basically a shower with a toilet in it.The manager seemed extremly rude, unfriendly and I would not recomend staying there unless you want to suffer!!!!!!!!

<Content>Excellent!!! My wife and I stayed for two days at Nadia Hotel and we had a wonderful experience. It is the most friendly hotel we have ever been. Osam (manager) and Michelle (staff member) found out that it was our wedding anyversary and they even sent us flowers to our room! They gave us a lot of usefull and unbiased information, so we did not have any problem in finding good restaurants with rasonable prices, sightseeing boat tours, getting around the city and so on. The hotel has one of the most espetacular views of the city. You can even see a canal and an old cathedral from your bed. The hotel location could not be better. It is only a couple of blocks away from the most important museums and from the Dam square (center square of the city).It is true that the hotel has small rooms and that you have to climb very narow and high stairs, but unless you are an erderly person, this should be not a problem, the hotel's hospitaliy, location and excellency will more than compensate for these minor inconviniences.The hotel its above its range. You get more than what you pay for (considering Amsterdam's standards).

<Content>Friendly and Welcoming in Amsterdam My boyfriend and I visited Amsterdam as a romantic getaway and the Nadia Hotel was the first hotel that we stayed at. The service was perfect, though the room was very small, typical of Dutch hotels. The small but cozy room overlooked a canal and a church. We wished that we would have stayed at the Nadia Hotel during our entire visit. Great location and value.

<Content>Loved it Booked solely from the reviews from this site, and the hotel lived up to expectations! Very very friendly staff who couldnt do enough to help. We originally booked a quad room for ourselves and our two children, but soon realised how safe the hotel was - lots of CCTV cameras around, so felt comfortable changing to two rooms - the children are 10 and thought it was a great adventure having their own room! Breakfast great - kids first time in Amsterdam and loved the food! Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again, having stayed at a couple of others which were far more expensive and far less personable.

<Content>"Charming" and "Romantic" might be cliche, but ... For a hotel stay i booked solely from reviews and photos on the internet, i'd say i outdid myself. my husband and i booked room #413 -- an extremely cozy, yet romantic double room with high ceilings, low lighting and stone balcony overlooking the busy street below. if you look at the front image of the hotel, it is the balcony room just by the N in the sign. since it is a corner room, it also has a pretty window overlooking westkerk cathedral and the canal. bathroom was small but updated and clean ... there was a place for everything. we didnt spend tons of time in the room however, since the hotel is located within walking distance to everything ....there is a particularly cool restaurant-cafe, panorama, on the corner.as for the staff, they were the friendliest that ive encountered in a long time,anywhere. the breakfast room, which is absolutely charming, especially on those dark chilly mornings in winter, was decorated for the holidays and provided a lovely starting point to every day ... thank you, nadia for a wonderful first experience in amsterdam!Arlington, VaUSA

<Content>Nadia Hotel is the Best in the Dam My girlfriend and I stayed at the Nadia from Nov 18-20 and loved every minute of it...Osam, Ming and the rest of the staff were wonderful and Osam even called to make sure we were OK since we had arrived late..It was my friend's 54th birthday and they brought flowers to our room and when I called (at 1am) for more coffee, tea etc they brought it right to our room..Who could ask for more....What a experience it was to celebrate a birthday in Amsterdam and be lucky enough to find this great Hotel...We had a lovely room with a canal view and also a view of the church...I loved listening to the church bells..Yes the stairs are steep and the room was on the small side but Who cares!!! You are in Amsterdam and it awaits you, get out and explore..We ate at Jennifer's across the street and they had the best chocolate waffles and devine pastries...I am still trying to figure out when I can go back there and will definitely stay at the Nadia (room #7) it is my home away from home and maybe they will hire me!!!!! Osam your the best and keep up the good work!!!Beth from OKC, Okla

<Content>Lots of STAIRS!!! Its very well located! Be prepared to climb a massive and steep flight of stairs, so DONT bring wheely suitcases... only backpacks. Request a room on the first level. Very small room, very strange bathroom, very plain breakfast but for the value... the BIGGEST bargain. You can WALK everywhere in the city so don't bother with any transport passes. Make sure you have a VERY good map.

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel extremely welcome and yes, the room was small, but adequate for two of us. In fact, it was cosy, intimate and in character with the rest of the building, which is historic and should never be modernised. I do have problems with my knees and was apprehensive about the stairs, but there is a hand rail on each wall and I managed them better than I had hoped. Just be careful as the steps are narrow. There is a small landing halfway up the staircase, which is good for an oxygen intake!The breakfast room is one of the prettiest I have ever seen. Sadly, the breakfast itself comprised only of bread, cake, croissants and various jams. I feel some cold meat and eggs would have been a nice addition. The room itself was decorated in dark wood paneling, with lots of shelves and a small, but very functional bathroom. It was very warm however, so we kept the window open at all times. Please be aware that trams run constantly and love to ring their bells and the church opposite chimes every 15 minutes. The beds were very, very narrow and extremely uncomfortable. We spent each night clinging onto the mattress for fear of falling onto the floor. Regarding cleanliness, the hotel was spotless and we were asked each day if we would like housekeeping to tidy our room. Despite the poor beds and lack of a decent breakfast, this is a lovely hotel, with friendly staff, in a fantastic location. Amsterdam is a beautiful, friendly, relaxed and fun place to be and I would challenge anyone to visit the city and not have a good time.For something a little different, visit De Efteling which is an amazing fairytale themed park. It is an hour train ride from Central Station, then approximately 50 minutes by bus. We went to visit the Winter Wonderland that they do for Christmas, and it was absolutely perfect. Fake snow, real bonfires, warme chocolade melk and hot waffles. Fantastic!

<Content>Very Wonderful Nadia Hotel is so wonderful! The staff were very warm and friendly! In very good location too. The stairs are high and steep, but inside it is beautiful. I felt so at home there, and can't wait to stay there again in my next visit to Amsterdam. I got wonderful quality for the price.

<Content>Great Time Lovely Hotel Just got back from Amsterdam after having spent 4 days at this hotel. The staff were great and they remembered our room number each time we visited reception. We were greeted with free drinks upon arrival and waited 5-10 mins untill our bags were taken to the room. The room was small but clean and tidy, breakfast was fine for me but my partner doesn't do continental breakfast but he had several teas. The location was great and we walked into Dam Sq in about 2 mins. All in all i would definatly go back again...

<Content>The Friendliest Hotel This is one of the friendliest hotels we've ever come across in what has to be the friendliest city in Europe - and it offers outstanding value for money in an excellent location. The rooms are tiny but spotlessly clean with everything you need, including tea and coffee-making facilities. Although the hotel was full for most of the five nights we stayed there, we never heard a sound from the adjoining rooms or from the Nadia's charming cats.The staff could not have been more helpful with advice on the best tram routes round the city and other useful tips, and their help with luggage up and down the stairs and its safe storage on the last day, plus the provision of coffee while we waited for transport back to the airport, were the icing on the cake. Tip: For transportation to and from Schiphol Airport, we used the Connexion Hotel Shuttle (---) which provides door-to-door service at unbeatable prices. For the return journey we had the minibus to ourselves, so it was like a personal taxi for a fraction of the cost.

<Content>Excellent Service  We enjoyed our stay at the Nadia and would definitely stay there again.Pros:* well-situated (close to Dam Square);* friendly, helpful staff;* welcome drink (non-alcoholic);* free wi-fi;* great balcony view of canal (if available).Cons:* steep staircase, four flights to top floor (although the staff will take your bags and it鈥檚 really not that bad, just hold the rails);* very small bathroom * limited breakfast (but we鈥檙e not overly concerned about meals anyway 鈥?get full and get out is our motto)The staff were very accommodating when we wanted to keep our room for an extra night鈥riendly, helpful people, just like everybody else we have met on both of our trips to Amsterdam 鈥?an awesome city!

<Content>5th Stay at Nadia This was the 5th time I have stayed at the Nadia Hotel, friendly staff, great central location for atttractions and lovely fresh flowers at the breakfast tables. The breakfast room can get a bit snug in the morning when the hotel is full and the rooms are a bit small with quite narrow beds, but this adds to the quaintness of the place. Over all a great little place - no doubt I will be back for my 6th visit!

<Content>Top Stuff To keep this review short and effective the hotel is very nice and very welcoming. All staff were most helpful and nothing was too much. Yes the stairs are very steep, but it all adds to the character. We stayed in a double deluxe room WITH balcony (you have to request this specificly when booking) which was on the top floor and had a cool view of what was going on outside. Deffinatly worth a stay if theres rooms available!! Many Thanks

<Content>Welcome Home I was welcomed to hotel Nadia with open arms. All of the staff were extremely helpful. The hotel is located on a beautiful canal and you can hear the bells of the West Church all day. The hotel is close to everything. The room that I stayed in was very clean and I had a wonderful view out of my window. The breakfast room is so charming, I just loved all of the fresh flowers. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Nadia is N-I-C-E I was there with my wife and a group of friends. We had 3 rooms total. two doubles and a single. I am from the USA and they were from UK. We stayed a total of 7 days and some had to leave in 4 days.I had a very nice room, although small as all Amsterdam Hotels are unless you are willing to pay 200 euro per night. I also must add the only time you will go to the room is to sleep and how much room is necessary for that. There is a safe in the room and a hairdryer. It was a bit dark and I asked for a lamp and it was delivered. They advertised wireless internet but at first it wasn't working. I must say that the owner/manager along with some outside help worked around the clock to make it work perfectly. So if wireless is what you need they have it and it was fast.The room was clean and we had a beautiful view of the canal with windows that opened, that made it even better as the church bells were very pleasant to listen to. The room was cleaned every day and the entire staff was very friendly. The beds were comfortable and the pillows just the way I like them. I felt very much at ease and comfortable here. The same 7 days at a few other places were 800+ euros and we went and looked at them. We found that we were winners at 650 euro. The only bad part of the whole experience is the steep steps, but if steps don't bother you as they didn't our 40-50 yr old group, then you won't have a problem. It was sort of an experience and a good laugh when you see the steps. Also if you like hot breakfast go across the street to Jennifers and tell the gentleman running the place you want Over easy Eggs like Angelo as he now knows what they are. Please Tell the Nadia owner Angelo, sends his regards. I will stay there again!!!

<Content>Terrible hotel It is a very small and dark hotel, very small room and also the bed. The manager and the staff are not correct with the guests and with me too, they talk too much between them and not do attention to the tourists. In the breakfast room, the personnel forgot many times to offer to me the coffe in the morning. I will not go back and never to this terrible Nadia hotel.

<Content>fresh fowers and friendly faces Having been warned about the steep staircase on the Nadia website it was still a surprise. However, we were met before we had ascended by a friendly young man who took our luggage. Tess on reception performed the official signing in routine with ease and directed us to the flower festooned breakfast room where we were given a welcome drink. Our room was tiny with 2ft 6inch twin beds and shower room. Functional and adequate except for insufficient lighting. Much appreciated were the small fridge, safe, telephone and tea/coffee facilities. Breakfasts were self service continental style with toast on request and drinks served with the familiar Nadia charm. On departure our luggage was stored until we were ready to be transported to the airport. Again we were directed to the breakfast room where we were plied with offers of refreshment. The staff carried our luggage down to the pavement and wished us a safe and pleasant journey.To sum up the Nadia in one sentence; a clean and friendly hotel suited to the more energetic slim visitor. Jean and Annie.

<Content>Perfect location Just spent a prolonged week-end in Amsterdam. We are a family of 5 - 2 adults and 3 children aged 11, 15 and 17 - and Hotel Nadia was absolutely perfect for this purpose. With a very central location we had most of the sightseeing within walking distance, Anne Franks house across the street, shopping and strolling in the nine streets just around the corner and very good restaurants at reasonable prices on the other side of the canal in Jordaan. The location couldn't be better!Very cosy hotel with small rooms and steep stairs - what else would you expect in an old house by the canal in Amsterdam? The breakfastroom has it's own charm and though small the personal manged every morning to seat the 5 of us at the same table. Extremely good and helpful service. We booked our rooms on the website and a with a phonecall in advance we were sure of rooms on the same floor - with a special view for the two old ones. We will keep Hotel Nadia in mind next time we come to Amsterdam.

<Content>would recommend the nadia hotel The Nadia Hotel was as nice as it described on its website. Found the staff really pleasant and our room was clean and comfortable. This Hotel was in an excellent location, all the main sites were within walking distant. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this Hotel. The only negative would be the long spiral staircase that you have to climb up with your suitcases. However a member of staff did carry my suitcase down the staircase for me after checking out. Would definitely recommend this Hotel.

<Content>a bit overrated I booked a room at the Hotel Nadia because it was recommended by Frommers. The hotel itself is nice, but we had several problems. The online reservation website asks you to specify what time you're arriving. This is more for their benefit then yours, which is important information for travellers coming in on overnight flights. We had to wait several hours before a room was ready in their very tiny cafe, where there were no seats available. Also, the very long, steep flight of stairs up to reception can be a bit daunting for weary travelers and very unwelcoming.

<Content>Hotel Nadia, Review from a students point of view. Stayed in the nadia hotel for 3 nights and just got back yesterday..... We were`nt looking for a total budget hotel so this seemed a good choice as it wasnt too expensive yet wasnt to shabby!Arrived at the hotel and first thing we saw was the stairs, this was funny for us as we are two young students who found them fun to run up but at the same time if your disabled/older then you might want to be prepared for it so its worth mentioning.when we got into the check in counter we were given some maps/drinks by the young pretty lady at the counter and she gave us our room key and wasreally nice all round and I would imagine they would help you out in any scenario you might get yourself into!got into our room and it was a bit small but very nice, tv, balcony, power shower, sink toilet, safe etc... and a general nice room all round, with no problems I can report on and we were both really pleased with it and we have a fairly high expectation on hotels as we are regular travalers.id say out of the whole of amsterdam this is probably the best location to be as there is a large supermarket 2 mins walk away plus your 2 mins walk away from the sqaure and personally id rather be staying 2 mins walk away from the sqaure as it quite loud and there are some dodgy looking peeps about so for the location of this hotel. It says on there website and brochure its about a 10 minute tram ride away from the central station... this is not true, for us it was about a 5 minute walk from the station on foot in the rain! so all in all, location this place is the best!to sum up my whole review, for all of you who are now looking through the endless hotel websites then reading bad reviews on them and getting annoyed with yourself, just stop there... im your avaredge travaler who normally spends around 60-80 pounds a night on a hotel and Id give this place a 3/4 star rating and have no reall negative onit, so do book it! its really nice place to relax and enjoy amsterdam and id also say to ask for the balcony rooms and then you can enjoy some drinks on a night there if you want to get away from the amsterdam constant rush, all in all 10/10 GREAT HOTEL!!! If nadia read this, let me say a big thanks to you and I will without a doubt be rebooking later this year, thanks.

<Content>Not good! We stayed here for 5 nights over easter and I wish we had stayed at home. The rooms are very very small. You could shower while sat on the toilet. Compact is an understatement. Cleaniness also seems to be lacking. In fact we changed rooms as in the first room I awoke to be COVERED in flea bites, disgusting, Second room was better. It was at the front of the hotel. Still very small and not practical bathroom. Not for us I'm afraid.

<Content>Excellent dutch experience! We stayed at Nadia hotel for 3 nights after extensive research on the net of reading reviews and found this Hotel to have the best ratings. After staying there we would highly recommend this hotel, Yes it has a steep stair case to welcome you, but this is typical in amsterdam and the staff were great as on arrival they carried all our bags to our room. The room was cosy, clean and comfortable. Handy location to all major sites and an excellent hotel map provided. All in all we had a great dutch experience!LnP from New Zealand.

<Content>Lovely place to stay. We visited this lovely little hotel with some friends (sept 06) for my 40th birthday. Yes the stairs are steep, but we had a laugh about them. Luckily our room was on the first floor, directly next to the dining room, so we didnt have any more stairs to climb, unlike our friends whose room was on the top floor!The staff were all very friendly and helpful, bringing our bags up to our rooms for us.The breakfast wasn't anything special. Basically toast. The room was small, but had a fridge, a safe and tea making facilities included in the price. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. We also had a balcony and enjoyed sitting on there for an hour before getting ready to go out for dinner, watching the locals cycling by. Amsterdam is a lovely city, with something to see and do for all ages. We are intending to return one day and will definately return to the Nadia if they have rooms available.

<Content>Decent, but limited I recently stayed at the Nadia for several nights. First, I'll say that I'm a seasoned business traveler, and have been to Amsterdam 11 times, so this is not my first small hotel expereince in the city.I arrived around 10am. No one offered to help me up the very steep stairs to the lobby which is one floor above street level. The staff was always very nice and helpful. I was offered coffee or tea if I wanted, and they checked my bags, advising the room would not be available until 1pm. More very steep stairs up to my room. Facing the steepness of the stairs was a real drag after a long day of walking around the city. If you don't have alot of stamina, skip this place. Yes, these stairs are steeper than any I've encountered in Amsterdam.My room was cramped, even by Amsterdam standards. The bedspread was torn and had burn holes, the sheets were clean, but had a rip in it. I did not receive fresh towels for several days - the staff would simply fold up the used towels and place them back on the rack. This was annoying as I was only given one hand towel and one bath towel, as a single guest. I found myself hitting my head on shelves, and banging my shin on the bed platform more often than I care to admit, as the room was so tight. As mentioned in other reviews, the toilet is in the shower. My toilet seat cover could not be lowered, nor could the seat be lifted, due to it being wedged between the toilet tank (hard to describe). This led to constant risk of items falling into the open toilet from the miniscule glass shelf above, the only place in the bathroom for your personal toiletries. The room was on the back of the hotel facing a courtyard, and was mostly quiet, with the exception of hearing the church bells of the Westerkerk through the night (this was very pleaseant, actually). Some of the nights were warm, so I had the window open. Apparently the reception desk also faced the courtyard some floors below, as on a couple of nights I was kept awake by the constant piercing ring of the reception desk telephone, echoing up the courtyard at all hours. Why the management doesn't either lower the volume, change the type of ringer (a flashing light perhaps?), or simply keep the window shut so as to not disturb the guests, is beyond me.I'd say the Nadia is an okay place to stay if you're not bothered by what I've mentioned. The location is very good for getting around the city (close to 3 tram lines, Canal Bus and Dam Square), there's an ATM across the street, and an internet cafe a block away. I feel the price was high for the room. I won't be staying at the Nadia again.

<Content>Lovely Friendly Hotel Hi, we stayed in the Nadia Hotel Sept 06. The Hotel itself is lovely although the rooms are very dated, small and the bathroom really smelt bad, but i think that is a problem in most hotels in Amsterdam. The staff and manager were the nicest people ever and our room was cleaned every day. We really enjoyed our stay at the Nadia and will definitely stay there again. This hotel is in the most perfect local with everything in walking distance. Great hotel with great people!!

<Content>'Quaint!' For a two star hotel int he city centre you couldn't do much better, but beware. The stairs are the steepest I have ever seen, if you are not that mobile forget it. The staff are very friendly and helpfull with that dutch sense of humour. The breakfast room is quaint with lovely street views, the bedrooms are small and cramped with the toilet (literally) in the shower. Overall an excellent location and reasonably priced.

<Content>Very comfortable retreat My husband and I recently stayed at the Nadia hotel and had a wonderful experience. All of the staff were extremely helpful and our room was very comfortable. The rooms are quite small as well as the bathrooms--but that seems to be common for amsterdam. I thought the price was on the expensive side--but we did have a private balcony and it is comparable to other hotels. The location was fantastic...right in between Jordaan and Dam square--about 10 min walk to centraal station and 3 mins to Dam Sq. The hotel was very clean, comfortable and overall we had an excellent stay! I highly reccommend this hotel over others--I researched many others and Nadia had the most benefits!

<Content>Highly Recommended - going back for our 4th stay in December! I have been reading the reviews for the Nadia and am glad to see that most agreed with us. As for the negative reviews some people must be really fussy. The rooms are clean and tidy, all with en suite facilities, TV, phone, safe, fridge.I'm not aware of any street noise and you get used to the Westerkerk bell ringing out every quarter of an hour - it just adds to the ambience of the holiday.Ok the stairs are steep but your luggage is brought up for you and deposited in your room - you only need to get yourself up and down the stairs.Osam and his staff go out of their way to make your holiday enjoyable - you are like part of the family. We have just returned from our 3rd stay at the hotel and are going back to spend Christmas out there. The hotel is centrally located for all the attractions, shops, restaurants etc and the staff are more than willing to advise of places to eat etc.Personally I would not hesitate in recommending the Nadia to friends and family.Rooms may be on the smaller side but it's somewhere to rest after walking miles. Almost like a home from home. We will always return to the Nadia when we visit Amsterdam. I can't help but recommend this hotel.

<Content>A long awaited return Just returned from my third stay at the Nadia, the first 2 being in 2001. I'd tried to book there since, but unfortunately it was always full for the dates I wanted. We were lucky this time and managed to get a room.This is a great hotel and I always enjoy staying there. The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean, and it's in a great location.

<Content>small but pretty my boyfriend and I stayed for the weekend in this lovely hotel. we really liked the location, every place that you might want to see are in walking distance. the management and stuff were all friendly and helpful. even though our room was kind of small everything was so clean and nice. the steep stairs can be the only problem if you don't like to climb.

<Content>Highly recommended Nadia is one of the best 2stars hotels in town. The location is perfect and you can reach every single part of the town within 15 minutes walk. The rooms were tidy and clean. And who cares about their odd shapes? The History of the place is a must to know! The management and staff were really friendly and helpful. Ignore the negative reviews and give it a try.

<Content>Give it a try. Really ! We had a great stay at the Nadia Hotel. We really did. Themanagement and staff were really friendly, helpful andcouldn't do enough for us. We had a fair bit of luggage andwhen they saw how much we had, they showed us severalrooms until we found one that would fit us and our bags quite happily ! Now just to address some of the complaints I've read in these reviews, Yes the rooms are tiny and some an odd shape.But how much time do you plan to spend in your room ? Yesthe stairs from the front door are really steep, but they employguys to bring your bags up and bring them down to you whenyou leave. So there's minimal bag lugging on your part. The hotel is in a good location and it suits the budget traveller. But mostof all, we'd stay there again quite happily. So ignore the whingers and give it a try.

<Content>Loads of character Stayed 3 nights at this lovely hotel. The family room was great value and the en suite was modern and very clean. We loved the hotel for its central location, its extremely friendly and helpful staff and its character. The rooms may have been a bit small, but the wood panelling and the view made up for everything.

<Content>Small but perfectly formed We stayed for a long weekend after reading about the hotel on Tripadvisor. The rooms are TINY but have everything you need - fridge, safe, TV, phone etc. Plus plenty of shelves and hooks, so we actually had more storage space than in many much bigger rooms in the past. We had a great balcony. Stairs are very steep!Staff were all very friendly and the breakfast was basic but fine.The only negative aspect was an odd smell in our room that was noticeable when entering from outside. We had to ignore it with the help of air fresheners. Our friends were in the next room which was odour free.If you just want somewhere to sleep and shower, the Nadia is just about ideal.

<Content>Steep stairs (an understatement!!!) We stayed here for 3 nights in May. It ended up being the most expensive hotel we stayed in during 2 weeks spent on short notice in Holland and Belgium. Proximity to the bus and tram stops was a plus. Our room was waaaaaaaaay up on the top floor, so we had 80 steps up and down to the main entrance. Fortunately we travel lightly, so we managed to survive the cramped room.The breakfast was good, standard fare and the staff were helpful.I found the stairs VERY steep and would not recommend this location to anyone with either height or balance problems. We requested a non smoking room and I was quite nervous about the smell of smoke in some areas. I felt it was a fire trap, but consoled myself with having the balcony off our tiny room, as an emergency exit.

<Content>Friendliest Little Hotel My boyfriend and I loved this little hotel, and we would definetly go back if we were to visit Amsterdam again. What was most impressive was the friendly hospitality we received, the staff were very helpful, we thought the staircase was a very interesting topic to write home about, we had no problem with it at all. The rooms were all we needed, its also a very close walk to Dam Square and The Red Light District.

<Content>Good location bad stairs The Hotel Nadia is in a great location, it is near to most of the touristc places. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included in the rate and was surprisingly good. The rooms were very small, so small that they ask you to leave some of your luggage in their storage area downstairs. My room was not very clean and the towlels were so old, faded and stained. I really wish I had my own towel with me. Elderly people and young children should not stay in this hotel because there is no elevator and the stairs are extremely dangerous, with very narrow steps, it is very scary. It only makes me wonder how many accidents has happened in those stairs.

<Content>Comfortable and friendly My 19 year old son and I stayed in a comfortable small room for three nights. I had requested a first floor (one flight above street level) and back room because of reports of the steep steps (they are steep, but they help with the bags) and street noise. We found the room quite comfortable and clean. Breakfast was good and the staff was friendly and quite helpful in terms of directions and suggestions. There is a tram stop a half block away which is quite convenient in getting to and from the cental station (which is also the way back to the airport). It is centrally located. I think it is competitivelypriced with similar quality establishments in central Amsterdam. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Amsterdam. It certainly helped make our stay in Amsterdam enjoyable.

<Content>Worst hotel in the world I was recommended this hotel, by Cresta Holidays, as i was travelling to Amsterdam from a couple of days.I could not believe when i saw the room i had to stay in. I cried most of the time, becuase it was absolutly terrible. It was tiny and dirty, and was just the worst looking rooms iv ever seen in my life. I will never be back in Amsterdam as i have such bad memories.Even if i was offered money to stay at the hotel, i wouldnt go near it with a barge pole. It looked more like a dirty brothel!!!

<Content>Mixed Feelings but have to remember it is a 2 star hotel Unfortunately, I arrived in Amsterdam at a time when all my favourite hotels were full due to a conference. I eventually had to go to the Tourist Information to book a room. Even here, rooms were full due to a conference in town. Whilst I was there, a phone call came in from Hotel Nadia due to a cancellation. I was offered a double room for 100euro. I agreed as I needed a bed for the night. The Hotel is situated quite centrally but in a rather grubby road. The staircase to reception needs to be seen to be believed....i have seen many steep staircases in Amsterdam but this was steeeeeeep!!!! However, an employee ( you are buzzed in from reception) came down and carried my bag upstairs. You are then greeted by reception and offered a free cold drink ! My double  room had a double bed , space for clothing, a tv, and tiny bathroom. I was grateful to find a room due to the conference so i was happy to be there. However, for 100euro plus booking fee it was definately overpriced. As a budget / 2 star hotel it was perfectly fine and as I normally stay in more upmarket hotels i know i need to be careful of my expectations. However, i still think 100 euro plus booking fee was overpriced for the quality of the room.My only complaint would be that there was a lot of noise coming from the restaurant / breakfast room late at night.Staff were very friendly , room overpriced for a 2 star budget hotel but if i had been lucky enough to get a good deal , i would not have any complaints apart from noise from through the wall.

<Content>Coziest place ever!!! This was one of the best parts of my trip. My husband and I took a trip to Europe during the 05/06 new year holiday period. On the way there we had pre-booked a room and I was worried because I hadn't faxed over my credit information. Well it wasn't a problem, we were greeted with warm smiles a friendly atmosphere and best of all.....good coffee. They got our room ready for us as we had some really smooth strong coffee and they even got us a few cookies to keep us from starving as they knew we hadn't eaten in hours. They truely made us feel welcome. Yes the rooms are small in fact very small bu,t there is plenty of room to put things away and in fact most of the hotels have very tiny rooms...this is Amsterdam, a small place that needs to accomadate a lot of people. It's clean though and that means a lot to us. We actually came back to the same hotel on our way back to the states after new years. It's very well located, we walked everywhere but if you prefer there is a tram stop right outside the hotel (1 block). Public transportation is amazing and word of advice stay away from taxis..they cost insane amounts of money. You can grab a tram outside of centaal station almost to the hotel door. Pack light and you'll do great. This is a hotel that makes you feel at home.

<Content>Great Wee Place GREAT WEE PLACEMy wife and I stayed at the Nadia Hotel for three nights and found it very satisfactory.On arriving when the door opened I saw the stairs and wondered how we would get the bag up but they shout down for you to leave it at the bottom and they will send someone down to take it to your room. 39 very steep stairs later we were at reception and the very helpful and pleasant staff allocated us a room on the second floor.The room was very small, but considering it was a 2 star budget hotel we were prepared for this. The room, had en suite facitities, phone, TV and tea and coffee. It was clean and room service changed the towels daily.The continental style breakfast was good and again the staff were very friendly.The hotel has a good central location and is an ideal base for visiting the many attractions of Amsterdam.

<Content>Great but little room Great staff, couldn't ask for better service. They are what makes this such a wonderful little hotel. Breakfast room has beautiful view. Great location, close to Anne Frank House and Dam Square. Some things to be aware of:1) No elevator and very steep stairs, but someone will help you to carry your bags up the stairs. If you have trouble climbing stairs, this is not the hotel for you.2) Extremely small rooms.

<Content>Excellent value  My husband and I stayed in the hotel Nadia for 2 nights. The location was excellent, you can actually see Anne Frank's house from the breakfast room, although the rooms were small, they were very clean and warm (an essential in February!) and the staff were very helpful. The breakfast was very nice and although the stairs were very steep, this was no hardship for 2 days stay. I would highly recommend the Hotel Nania.

<Content>average..... only just ! My husband and I stayed at the Nadia hotel for 2 nights for a short city break in the lovely city of Amsterdam.Sadly we were very disappointed with the hotel, the location was great and most of the staff were friendly except one memeber of the breakfast staff who was very angry that we had come for breakfast at 10.10 as she abruptly told me that breakfast actually finished at 10.30 and we were late ... 20 mins is ample time for breakfast in my book ! However the main thing that would stop us from staying here ever again was the actual bedroom - it was tiny, so small that the door couldn't open fully and the noise of the traffic was almost unbearable. I know that the hotel room shouldn't really matter during a short city break but it does need to meet a certain standard and being able to sleep without so much noise would've been a plus. My advise would be to stay else where. Amsterdam is a great place to visit and the rail link from the airport to central station is great, makes getting to and from the airport a breeze.Just pick another hotel !

<Content>Excellent service  Just stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Nadia, which I'd booked after reading some of the reviews posted on this site. On first arrival the doorway is a bit uninviting with a buzzer, (oh yes the tram stop is Westerkirk, it's really easy to find from the station)but at least you feel a bit secure because they buzz you in each time so people aren't just wandering in. And yes the stairs are really scary looking but you do get used to them, although any one with mobility difficulties would not manage them. The room we first stayed in was a twin room at the back of the hotel, but I'm afraid I couldn't cope with the claustrophobic feeling it gave me and the manager was really understanding and we managed to move rooms. The rooms are small, but very clean and the sheets and beds are comfy, and the room service is excellent. Obviously if you are looking to spend a lot of time in your room you may find it negative re the size of the rooms, but if it is a city break or you are not bothered too much about the room size, then I would recommend it. The location is good and we walked most places and also took the trams. I cannot praise the staff enough and they were extremely friendly and helpful and I would definitely go back again! And one last thing the coffee is really good that they serve for breakfast!!

<Content>Helpful staff We stayed in mid Feb. when all 40 odd rooms were booked. I Knew the location which is absolutely central and very very close to the Westerkirk, The Anne Frank house, behind Dam square and only 10 mins walk from the Station. The staff are friendly and helpful, all with perfect english. The rooms are average for Amsterdam, small but comfortable.Enjoyed the visit and happy to return.

<Content>great 2 week stay My husband and I stayed there 2 weeks and it was great. You wont be staying alot of time in any hotel, but some days you want to rest. The people there are so helpfull and nice. There are the steps that yes are a killer, but they do help you with your luggage and you get used them fast for you have alot of walking do to. Staying there you are close to everything. We did have are clothes washed and they do charge a fee. If you need anything they do it or really try for you. We had a great time and plan to go back. It was great for the price and we didnt go for a big fansy place. We got what we wanted bed, private bathroom, t.v. phone, frig, and a bed for two. November was great weather and we could put the heat on and leave the window open. The bells are not a big bother, I liked them. You do have to leave you keys everytime you leave, and they buzz you when you come back. There is no vistors allowed, and I liked that, no one running around. Breakfast is nice, not American, but you get a nice breakfast and dont have to spend more money. All in all we plan to go back and stay there again.

<Content>A great find! I really loved this hotel. It's pretty basic but this is more than made up for by the fantastic service and incredibley homely atmosphere the owners and staff provide. When we arrived, we had been up since 3am as we had caught the early morning flight from liverpool. It was freezing cold, sleety and windy when we arrived in amsterdam but the welcome we received at the Nadia really cheered us all up. Once we had navigated the notorious stairs (we left our bags in the ahll and the staff brought them up for us - thank God!)we were warmly welcomed at reception. We were there before our rooms were ready so the owner sat us in the breakfast room with a pile of brochures and booklets and kept our mugs of free coffee full until our rooms were ready. The rooms are tiny but so well laid out that they have everything you need and more. The rooms even have fridges which I know from staying in Amsterdam several times before is very rare, expecially for a 3*. The location is good, right by the Anne Frank museum on Prinsengracht and only a few minutes walk from Dam Square. Also, our favourite coffeeshop (La Tertulia) is just around the corner so this is another bonus! Breakfast is simple continental style - croissants, pastries, fruit, ham, cheese, toast, jam etc. with lots of fruit juice and cosntant refills of freshly made coffee from (I think) the owner's wife, who is really friendly and funny. I've read other reviews on here complaining about the room size and I imagine if you want to sit around all day in a big spacious 5* hotel for your visit, then you will be disappointed with the Nadia. If, like us, however you just want a base to sleep and eat breakfast with great, warm, friendly service, I highly recommend the Nadia. I'm already planning my next trip!

<Content>Excellent but a bit cramped!!! I loved my stay at the Nadia Hotel!!! I picked it based on reviews I discovered here and the low cost for hotels in Amsterdam. Although the rooms were small, the space was utilized well. We had a balcony over looking the street and Anne Frank's house. At times, I could smell pot in the hallway but I never smelled it in my room.

<Content>Cheap, clean and friendly. Great situation, within easy walking distance of all the major sites.The entrance is just a single doorway and the stairs to the reception area are the steepest I've ever seen! However we did not have to carry our luggage up or down these stairs.We vacated out room on the morning of departure and the luggage was left in our room until it was put into our taxi when we left the hotel.We also got a free welcome drink when we reached reception on the first day!The staff are very friendly and helpful and all speak English.The rooms are very small and hot. We left our window open at all times and the traffic is very noisy throughout the night. The bathroom is also tiny but the shower was very good. As we only spent a short time in our rooms this did not matter too much.We did not bother to unpack our suitcases as the room was too small for a wardrobe. Breakfast was basic - croissants,toast,cheese, jams, coffee -but it was adequate.We found the restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel tended to close about 10.30pm and the first night we did not realise that there were plenty of places off Dam Square that stayed open much later.A great little hotel but I would prefer a bigger room next time.

<Content>Not a bad little place! Even after all the warnings on this site I wasn't prepared for the stair case leading to the first floor reception! It was negotiable but take care as even the treads on the steps are very narrow. I went with 4 friends and we booked into the Nadia 2 hours early due to the early flight arrival. Our luggage was placed into a 'baggage storage area' immediately after the simple booking in procedure. This baggage area was nothing more than a small alcove with a curtain so don't leave anything too valuable there. It's location in the city is ideal and close to some very good restaurants and bars. Get the train directly from the airport (Schipol) to centraal station. Come out of the main station entrance and head down 'Damrak', at the monument turn right and go over a couple of narrow canals. The hotel is on the corner of 'Raadhuistraat' but make sure you look for the hotel sign as the entrance is a single doorway. The staff are really polite and helpful. This was the case when I thought I'd lost my passport. They put me straight onto the British consulate. As with the other reviews the rooms we had were tiny. Ours was supposed to be a triple but would have been better described as a small twin. If you're chlaustraphobic you wont be impressed so if this bothers you, pay a little more for a hotel with larger rooms. All in all a reasonable hotel for the price in a good location. I wouldn't personally use it again but only because the rooms are so small. The staff and location are great. Fantastic city, wonderful accommodating Dutch people who made a great effort to make 5 'Brit tourists very happy. Hoping to make our booking to Amsterdam for early next year very soon.

<Content>Best experience ever! The hotel is very simple and yes the staircase is very steep but it's all worth it. The location i brilliant and the view is cute, the staff is just absolutely amazing, I made such great friends and I had a real good time. The room I stayed wasn't exactly luxurious but had everything I needed and was really clean so I have no complaints at all. Overall I would say this was an excellent choice and very good value for money plus I came back with a few extra friends which is always good!!! I recommend Nadia Hotel.

<Content>Good hotel for the money I stayed at the Nadia for 3 nights in September, 2005. Yes - the staircase is very steep, and the rooms are tiny. But its centrally located, the rooms are clean and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful (they even have unbrellas you can borrow should it rain during your stay). I had a room on the front so the traffic noice could have been a problem, but a pair of earplugs solved that, and the little balcony with a view of the Westerkirk more than made up for the noise. Anne Frank House is just around the corner, the Dam is a 3 minute walk, and the tram stop is just up the street. I had a single room on the same floor as reception and the breakfast room - room came complete with cable TV, a safe, coffee and tea makings, and a very tiny, spotlessly clean private bathroom - all for only 55 Euros a night. Breakfast is served from 7:30 to 10:00 - simple continental breakfast of croissants, bread, marble cake, juice and really good coffee, in a comfortable although very small, breakfast room.And regarding those stairs - I asked and was told that no guest has ever fallen down them yet! All in all, its a good hotel for the money.

<Content>Disappointing We booked this hotel based upon some reasonable reviews. Sadly, it turned out to be a big disppointment. It appears that some of the more recent (poor) reviews are more reflective of the true standard of this hotel. Our room was small but since we spent most of the day sightseeing, this was no real problem. More importantly, the room was incredibly worn and dingy. Also, the shower did not work properly. There was only a trickle of water from the shower which ranged in temperature from freezing cold to scalding hot. In addition, there was little soundproofing meaning that we were woken up by lots of people coming home at night. Overall, the hotel is badly in need of some refurbishment and is very over rated on this site. I've given it a two star rating because it is relatively cheap, the location is not bad and the staff were reasonably friendly. However, I would certainly try somewhere else next time.

<Content>The Best of the 2 Stars We began and ended our trip with stays at the Nadia. The staff was outstanding, friendly and helpful. The owner, Osam, was by far the friendliest hotel owner I have ever had the pleasure of paying for a room. He made us feel like he was really glad we choose his hotel and made us sooo welcomed. Hotel location is great, but than again any hotel in the city center is good. From the time we arrived, I never touched my luggage going up or coming down. The breakfast room was comfortable and cozy with a great view of the WesterKirk. We did opt for the larger room with canal view and a balcony which was awesome. My next trip to Amsterdam will definitely include a stay at the Nadia. Thanks for eveything Osam and staff, especially the surprise room decoration upon on return at the end of our trip. See you in a couple of years.....SR from Centennial, Colorado.

<Content>Don't even think about this place The staff was friendly but the rooms are very small. I had an inside room and it was so hot and stuffy I had to ask for a fan which was not much help. I would hate to be there in the summer. I kept telling myself that for the money it was OK but I saw much nicer places in the city for the same price. The stairs are very steep. The breakfast room has a grat view if you can get a seat. The breafast is nothing but bread,juice and coffee and maybe cheese. I think the Nadia has seen better days. Look for a better hotel, you don't go on vacation to climb steep stairs and sleep in a prison cell.

<Content>OK place, small rooms with GREAT service.... Stayed ot the Nadia Hotel sept 9th 2005. Well, what to say.....Okay, the rooms are REALLY small! The staff were absolutely wonderful! So nice and courtious. The previous post had it pegged pretty much, the rooms are small, the breakfast room is a bit small, but we had no problem sitting and eating. We had a balcony room which was nice, but had to pay extra because of a big IBC convention that was in town annualy that weekend. So 140 euros was the damage, definitely not worth that, but if you could get it for around 80-100 euros it would be worth it. Overall I think that I got what was advertised no suprises. Its just not luxury, if you want that you have to pay a bit more, we were to see the city not stay in the room.

<Content>Smallest Room Ever If you are travelling alone - please don't stay at this Hotel. The single room I was assigned on the 4th floor was the smallest I have ever stayed in. There was just enough room fot the bed. The bathroom was also tiny. Avoid!

<Content>Overall a good hotel. Our party of three stayed in the Hotel Nadia in June 2005. We booked a double room and a single for four nights. This hotel is in a central location, easy to locate (just around the corner from Dam Square) and is about a 15 minute walk from the Central Railway Station.This hotel has some good points and some bad points. As with most hotels in Amsterdam, the staircase is quite steep. When you enter the hotel, there are 35 stairs to climb to the reception area. We were given a complimentary drink when we arrived. We warmly welcomed and checked in.The double room (which was actually two single beds pushed together) appeared to be clean and tidy. There was a fridge, tea and coffee facilities (which were not replenished as they were used), a desk with 2 chairs, a TV with 4 channels (not cable as advertised) and a VERY compact bathroom. The bathroom in our double room was actually a shower room with a toilet and a basin in it. The bathroom did omit an odour (an unpleasant sewer smell which could sometimes be smelt in the room). The single room had a queen size double bed (small double) which sppeared to be clean and tidy. There was a fridge, a desk with 1 chair, a TV with satelite/cable channels. There was no tea/coffee making facilities. There was an ample sized bathroom with a separate shower. Both of these rooms faced the front of the hotel, and therefore noise from trams and buses from the street could be heard at night which sometimes made it difficult to sleep. A breakfast consisting of croissants bread, cheese, marble cake, selection of jams and honey, tea and coffee and fresh orange juice which is served between 8am - 11am in the cosy breakfast room.We very much enjoyed our stay at Hotel Nadia. My only complaint was the alkward bathroom (which sometimes smelt). The absence of cable TV in our room didn't bother us because we came to enjoy the city, not watch TV. As many other people on Tripadvisor have said, the hotel is small as most Amsterdam hotels tend to be, but lets face it, if you see your hotel room as someplace clean to sleep and wash, it isnt a problem. If you want a larger room, then look for a 3/4 star hotel. If you are considering staying at this hotel, also check out Hotel Boheme.

<Content>Good Hotel for the Price We stayed at the Hotel Nadia one night while we were in Amsterdam. The location was central in the city and about a 15 minute walk from the train station. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Everyone spoke good English. They gave us complimentary water at check-in and then again when we got back later that night after checking out the Red Light District. The room was comically small but clean and quiet. The breakfast was average ( a typical European breakfast with croissants, bread, cheese, juice, and coffee). However the stairs in the hotel are quite step and there are plenty of them. This was not a problem for us but I would not recommend this hotel for anybody who is elderly or at all physically disabled. We would defintely stay here again as it was nearly half the price as other hotels in Amsterdam and very acceptable.

<Content>A nice hotel. My fianc茅 and I stayed at Hotel Nadia this past weekend while in Amsterdam celebrating my 30th birthday.The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from Dam Square, which makes getting around easy. There are several tram stops near the hotel as well.When you open the front door to the hotel you will be astounded by the stairs that lead up to the reception, the 2 flights of stairs that go straight up! So this is defiantly not a hotel for anyone who has trouble climbing stairs, as they are a bit steep.Once we made it up the stair, we were given a warm welcome and a nice cold welcome drink and assigned our room. Which was on the 4th floor, so up we went 2 more flights of steep stairs.The room we had was the standard room which over looked nothing in particular as it was at the back of the building. At first I thought I wanted to try to get a canal room, but realized that the traffic noise probably would have bothered me.Now the room is very small and basic but it is clean and comfortable. Our bathroom was the same. It is basically a large shower room, so no romantic baths. My only complaint was that the hotel lacks air conditioning, which would have been nice one the really warm nights. My second complaint, which has nothing to do with the hotel, was about the church nearby that rang it's bells all through the night, so it made sleeping with the window open a bit of a pain.Over all we had a great stay. The staff was lovely, recommending a fantastic seafood restaurant to eat at, and always making sure we knew where we were going when heading out. The hotel may be small but it is clean. So if you don't care much for the trappings of a posh hotel, then stay here.

<Content>Friendly staff, smelly rooms The staff at the Nadia Hotel were very friendly  gave us a great overview of the city when we arrived. We were very impressed with how helpful they were  the free breakfast service was also a nice bonus (mostly bread  jams). If you're on a budget, this place is fine. However, the room was clean but smelly (old pipes?) and very small. The door hits the bed and there is little room for suitcases. The location was mediocre - close to the Anne Frank museum and the main canals, but not the best area. I'd recommend spending more and staying closer to the Leidesplien. The Nadia Hotel wasn't terrible, but I would not recommend this place to friends because of the smell  location.

<Content>Great little hotel I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it to be great value for money. The room was small but it was clean and had a safe, fridge and tea/coffee making stuff. The stairs were a bit of a climb since we were on the top floor but it was made easier by the staff carrying the bags to and from the room. I found all the staff members to be very helpful, they all speak great English and even gave us complimentary cans of juice upon our arrival.The hotel is situated between 2 tram stops and is only minutes from Dam Square so the location is excellent for the money. I would definitely stay at the Nadia again and would recommend it to anyone trying to find a clean, central hotel in Amsterdam.

<Content>Just ok, nothing more Stayed at Nadia Hotel for one night, in a single room.So my rewiew is based on the single room.The room was really, really small, actually the smallest ive ever visited.The room had the most necceasry things, but no shower soap.I give this hotel on star for the loccation, which is really great.Short walk to Anne Frank House, and short walk to Dam Square.I also give one star to the helpful staff, they were very keen to help me arrange things. I paid 85 euro for one night, it dont think thats worth it.So, my conclusion is ; I wont stay here again.

<Content>Cheap and cheerfull Just come back from 4 nights here and was again treated very well from the staff. I have stopped here before and can highly recommend it, the rooms are small, but they have everything u need, the rooms are clean and it's also quiet.The price is very reasonable considering the location and I would definately stop again if there are rooms available. I can recommend it and you wont be disapointed if youve booked a room here.

<Content>Besy hotel in Amsterdam! I've been to Amsterdam several times and have had different degrees of luck with the various hotels I've sampled there. The Nadia is by far and away the nicest hotel I've stayed in in the city. I booked it after reading the reviews on here. It is fantastic value for money, cosy, friendly and centrally located. The rooms are tiny (like cabins) but have everything you need. The staff are the nicest people you could hope to meet and nothing was to much trouble for them. As for the stairs.....they are overwhelming when you first open the front door and see the receptionist peering down from miles away up on the first floor but we were instructed to leave our bags in the hall and staff quickly brougt them up to our rooms. I notice someone on here was complaining about having to wait for their room to be ready - we had a wait too but the staff escort you to the dining room and offer you free hot or cold drinks so it's hardly a hardship! Breakfast is a simple continental spread - lovely raisin toast, croissants, cheese and great coffee! - and the dining rom is really cosy like the rest of the hotel.Will definitely be staying here again.

<Content>Why all the good reviews?? I booked this hotel based on the good reviews on this site, but I was very disappointed. Our room was not very clean (one example: the tops of the windows were so dirty you couldn't see through them) and we had to wait 45 minutes after check in time to actually check in (after we kept being told it would be 5 more minutes). The hotel was in a good location and we had a wonderful time in the city. I can only imagine those reviewing it on this site are comparing it to hostels. (And I must say, I once stayed in a hostel that was cleaner and nicer than this hotel). Also: You have to climb a steep flight of steps to get into the hotel. This was fine for us, but older or handicapped people should beware.

<Content>Great location, great value I booked this hotel after reading all the positive reviews, and I was not disappointed. The price and location are very hard to beat(~70 Euro and right by Dam/Anne Frank/tram stop). The rooms were very small, as to be expected in the Amsterdam city center area, but there was sufficient room for more luggage than 2 people should ever need, which is what we had. The bed was nice and soft, and the room/bathroom was clean and well-kept. The reception was also very friendly. The only problems I had, which would not keep me from staying here again, were the stairwell was narrow and very steep, not to mention long, but what else would u expect in the land of narrow canal houses. Its not too bad as long as u are healthy, but the elderly and disabled would find it very difficult, especially loaded with luggage. Also the closest tram stop goes right in front of the hotel and stops a block over, in front of a church, but if you are not paying attention to the area, and dont have a very detailed map, you may not notice that the street changes names between the hotel and the tram stop. This, combined with a hotel map printed online, led us to walk in a big circle around a large block, when all we had to do was walk the other way 100 feet from the tram to the hotel. But this is more of a warning to those who choose to stay here, and by no means a complaint against the hotel, which I highly recommend as a tourist class hotel. Its not the Ritz, but its much cheaper, and nicer than many 3 star hotels I've been to.

<Content>Super little hotel in a great location! This is a super little budget hotel in a great location for Amsterdam. First impressions is just a doorway between shops, behind which are the steepest stairs i've ever seen! However, the very friendly staff will help you with any luggage and give you a complimentary drink to recover!I have to say that it was also the smallest room i have ever stayed in with approx one foot of space around the double bed which was pushed up against the window! However, it had absolutely everything we could have wished for... tv, fridge, safe, shelves and radiator all clinging precariously to the walls! It had a small but adequate wardrobe and a minute but clean shower/wc. We also requested a canal view room with a balcony and were lucky enough to be given one by the lovely hotel owner. The balcony offered lovely views of the Westerkerk church and canal one way and the rear of the Grand Palace at Dam Square the other. The rooms viewing the road could be a bit noisy with the chimes of the church and a tram stop outside but it never bothered us.As mentioned the nadia hotel is in a great location, minutes from Ann Frank's house, the red light district and Dam Square and is easily walkable from the Centraal train Station.If you want a budget, central hotel then we would highly recommend hotel Nadia and we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Very Small! Dont get me wrong, the hotel is beautiful  the staff was pretty nice. But not what I expected. Our room consisted mainly of a giant bed, a desk with a chair, tv up high,  bathroom. There was no extra room, and we literally had to cramp ourselves into the room. We didn't just have backpacks, but 2 giant American suitcases as well, which was not easy lugging up the extremely high  narrow staircase. The bathroom was also letting off a strange, sewer-like smell.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed at the Nadia in Oct. 2004 ,the staff was great ,the room was small, but being a single I did'nt expect it to be grand. The room was cleaned every day. I had a choice of a front view or rear view,being my first time in Amsterdam I thought a front view would be nice,but it was quiet noisey as the Nadia is on a major street. The stairs are steep but the staff will carry your bags for you. If you're thinking about staying here,book early, as I'm having a hard time booking a room for my next trip. Tot Ziens

<Content>Very friendly , fairly priced and very clean I stayed in Nadia Hotel for several times but this is the 1st time for me to write a review about it . The hotel is in the heart of Amsterdam , which makes everything in the downtown just walking minutes around you. Also infront of it directly is the Tram and Bus stations so you can easily go to any where you need in the city.The Hotel is very clean , the stuff is very friendly that makes you feel home . Rooms are very clean and well equipped . The building gives you the feeling of the Old modernized Amsterdam . The only bad issue about the hotel is the stairs but this is the case with all Amsterdam Hotels which are built inside the historical city buildings. The room size was ok but not so big. I would definetely recommend it and would continue staying there in my next visits to Amsterdam.

<Content>Great Little Hotel I stopped at the Nadia Hotel after reading good reviews on the internet. I was not disappointed, the Hotel is as many others say very friendly and extremely clean. The staff cannot do too much for even down to a welcome drink.It's in a good location about 5 minutes from Dam Square and located on the corner of the canal looking over the Westerkerk Church.The rooms are on the small side but all have an individual feel about them, not like the normal standardised layout you normally get in Hotels. Ours had both a balcony and a view looking over the church.The only downside is the steep stairs and this would be difficult if you have problems with them. The staff however are very quick to help carry luggage around.Would I stay there again - definately. Can I recommend it - Yes (I've stopped at the prestigous Die Port Van Cleve Hotel and its rooms were worst). Is it value for money - Yes.Have at look at their web site for a better feel. It accurately reflects what you will get. ------------

<Content>great service! The thing that makes the place special has to be the staff. We were offered arrival drinks and luckily our luggage was taken to our room so we didn't have to struggle up the stairs. We had a double room with a balcony - large it wasn't but the balcony helped. Bit noisy being on a main tramway, but these stop running at 1am. Breakfast was a simple affair - cheese slices, sliced bread and cakes, croissants (if you're quick), jams etc. Would recommend Nadia for the location too - Amsterdam is easy to get round on foot and the hotel was very close to Dam Square, Anne Frank House etc. We had a lovely time at Nadia - it's not five star but perfectly adequate for a long weekend break.

<Content>A1 Amsterdam We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and thought it was great. The staff were excellent and very helpful. The steep stairs up to reception, and the size of the room didn't come as too much of a shock thanks to this review site. We would recommend a room with a balcony to relax on and take in the ambience of Amsterdam. The location is very central and handy for everything you will want to do. We are already planning our next trip.

<Content>A fantastic place to stay! The Nadia is a wonderful little hotel. We were horrified at the first sight of the staircase, but staff immediately appeared to carry our suitcases for us, then gave us free drinks to help us recover from the climb. The people were extremely friendly and helpful, the location is superb - a few blocks from the city centre, but far enough away from it to be peaceful - and we loved the city. Hoping to stay there again in the near future.

<Content>Small and Friendly Stayed here four nights, Sept. 3-6, 2004. Good location next to the Westerkerk. First thing you will notice is the stairs, very steep, quite a climb. Second thing you will likely notice is how friendly the staff is (all of those that I encountered) and I was greeted with a welcome drink. Postage stamp size single room, very clean. Shower was really just a corner of the bathroom with a curtain but adequately functional. Apparatus to make coffee or tea in the room as well as a safe. Breakfast included in price of the room, various breads, cheese, coffee and juices. Booked a single room for 50 euros for my sister who was to arrive from Florida, but a hurricane prevented her departure from Miami. I didn鈥檛 know until way past the cancellation deadline, but the hotel staff felt bad and didn鈥檛 charge me for her room. That was nice of them. If you don鈥檛 mind a small room it is a good choice for the budget traveler and the staff will make you feel welcome.

<Content>I felt that I am staying with my friends... After a long trip, what more you need than poeple smile to you and help you with all what you need!I spent a week in Amsterdam attending a conference. because I don't know teh cisty, I was afraid where I will stay and how I will manage myself. But, it was a good choice and poeple are extermly helpful. I remember, I asked the manager about something related to my mobile and he sent one of his employees with me to the shop! They had been so helpful and friendly.The room was not so big, but it is suitable with the price they have. It is a cool place to stay in.I think I should visit Amsterdam one more day and stay in Nadia.

<Content>Home away from home My friend and I decided to stay at Nadia Hotel while in Amsterdam because of the great reviws that we had read on many different websites including this one. All of the good reviews were right. Our room was very clean and had a great view from the balcony. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. They were always happy to help us and made us feel right at home. We were thinking of spending a few nights at the hotel and then visiting other parts of europe, but we liked the hotel and Amsterdam so much that we decided to stay there for our whole 10 day duration. Amsterdam is a great city and we WILL be back. I will to be sure to have my room reserved at Nadia.

<Content>Very Good I stayed short in that hotel in July 2004 and was amazed by the quality of service as compared with the charged fee and moreover the attitude of staff. The staff was extremely polite and helpful. The only negative thing was very steep stairs, however the staff was always careful to take my luggage coming in and going back. Another bad thing was small rooms, however, they were very clean with modern facilities. Really recommend.

<Content>Excellent little Hotel If you can make it up the stairs then you will love the Nadia. Just come back from a 4 day break there and for the rate they charge it was a lovely little hotel, much like a really friendly English guest house. We had a balcony overlooking Westerkerk. Rooms are small but good enough for what you need......who wants to spend ages in a hotel room when you are in Amsterdam anyway!

<Content>Friendly, very clean, great location My first time at Nadia hotel, I only had one night reservation, the hotel was full but they were extremely helpful and even though I had to switch rooms they kept me for the length of my stay. I am allergic to dust mites so for me it is very important to stay in a clean place and at Nadia hotelI was very pleased. My second time there I got to experience more of their friendliness and their great customer service standards. The rooms are small as it is always the case in Europe but I enjoyed their renovated and clean bathrooms. Breakfast time was great enjoying the view of Wester churchIf you go there please check the painting of the hotel in the west wall. I'm going back again!

<Content>Amazing View We stayed here with our two girls (6 and 4 years old). The view of Westerkerk was worth the price of the hotel room.The staff was very kind and friendly, esp. to the children. The shower was close to the toilet and all the beds were twin size, but part of the fun of traveling is learning to accommodate to another country's standards. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Under Rated For location,sparkling cleanliness and value, the Nadia is hard to beat, but the friendliness of the staff make the holiday. Nothing is too much trouble to ensure your stay is comfortable.Like others we hope to return soon to the Nadia and Amsterdam -the family acceptance and consideration we found exceptional - you cannot buy this quality!

<Content>nadia hotel, my second family I spent 1 week in Nadia Hotel and I really enjoyed it! It was wonderful! The ppeople were so friendly and kind, always trying to help in everything that you need. The rooms were very snug, tidy, warm and clean, good rooms... I decided to travel alone, sometimes this can make you feel insecure, but my stay in amsterdam was incredible, the place and the staff really made me feel at home!!!

<Content>Nadia cheap and clean my boyfriend and I stayed at the Nadia in Januaryof 04 we where a little in shock when we saw the stairs but all and all the Nadia was not that bad our room was small but we had a balcony and the hotel itself was kept clean and we got a some exercise by walking up those stairs twice a day. If you are looking for a cheap clean place in Amsterdam the Nadia is your place. But be prepared it is nothing special

<Content>Hated it! We stayed here in October 2002.The room we were given was on the top floor, we needed oxygen by the time we'd got up there! The double room we were given was dreadful, if one of us wanted to get in or out of the bathroom door, the other had to sit on the bed to make way. There was no light shade on the main light, the shower was a mere trickle and it was just generally dingy.Would rather stay at home than go back to the Nadia!

<Content>'Excellent hotel on a budget' Stayed two nights with husband and daughter, location was fantastic - you are in the centre of it all. We were aware of the steps as it was highlited before booking but it made the hotel even more like a typical 'Amsterdam' house. For what you pay, the rooms were as expected. As for the staff, well they were EXCEPTIONAL!!! We even got invited to a small family gathering as it was the owners birthday party which included a cake to be shared out. Our daughter thought it was the best thing ever!! If you want genuine hospitality then definitely stay here. Without a doubt we shall return on our next trip. The only downside for us was the noisy traffic throughout the night, but then we did book a budget room and our room was overlooking the main street.

<Content>Warm  I've just got back from a lovely weekend in Amsterdam. We stayed at the Nadia Hotel and were very pleasantly suprised. The first thing you see when you open the door is a massive steep staircase. Immediately, the receptionist shouted down for us to leave our luggage at the bottom and someone would bring it up for us. We weren't due to check in until 1pm (we arrived about 9.30am), but they were so welcoming and invited us to help ourselves to breakfast in the dining area. The staff were lovely and friendly and I found the whole experience enjoyable.The hotel is perfectly located next to the westerkerk (you can hear the bells chime) just round the corner fromt he Anne Frank House (well worth a visit). We found the location to be fairly central to all parts of the city.Although the room was small, it was clean and comfortable.All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Really friendly and helpful staff I went with 3 of my friends, we found that the staff were really helpful and friendly. The stairs up to reception were a little steap but not really a problem and the toilet/shower was a little cramped but everything else was really good. Breakfast from about 7.30am to 10.30am allows you plenty of time to get something to eat. The location of the hotel is excellent, right by the center of amsterdam and just 10 minutes walk to most places!! For what you pay, it really was good. The rooms are nice, they have a fridge, t.v with cable and a safe. I will definetly go back to the hotel when i go back to amsterdam.
