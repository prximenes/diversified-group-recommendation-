<Content>Convenient, Good and Central This is our second time staying in this hotel. It is very conveniently located, the basement has direct access to a metro station and is walking distance from JR Yurakucho Station, which is excellent for people using the Rail Pass. Mercure is also located centrally in Ginza area. The room might seem small to some people but it is a standard hotel room size in Japan. So is normal and the place is very clean and comfortable.

<Content>Hidden gem of hotel in Ginza We stayed there for 4 nights with our 5 year old. Loved the place, it's clean, staff are very professional, conveniently located. Walking around the area, you will find lots of local eateries at reasonable prices. Famous American fast food chain located just below the hotel, which was convenient as my son loved having the breakfast there. A few 24 hour type shops located nearby to get snacks or drinks. Getting there wasn't too much of a problem if you follow the instructions provided by the hotel but I suggest getting the Japanese name to give to the cab driver. We took the train from the airport to TOkyo station and then took a short taxi ride from the station to the hotel.

<Content>Great for the price We paid $180 / night, and our room was really nice, if a little small. Our room was really clean and cute. The place is a little hard to find, it's basically near really high-end stores, so if you've got a girlfriend with an expensive taste, beware because she could get stuck in Tiffany's or Gucci's when walking to and from the hotel.Great location. If I come back to Japan, I'd definitely book here again.

<Content>convenient location We have stayed here about 4-5 times over the past few years. We choose it for it's location. If we are needing to be in the Ginza area or on the east side of Tokyo it is very handy to everywhere. The rooms have everything you need and are very clean and tidy. The view is city view, the room size is small, compact really. Internet connection great. Comfy beds. Good for a short stay.Check in and check out is smooth and the reception is on the 2nd floor, take the lift. Limited parking is available but there is a size restriction. Lots of cafes nearby so have never gotten around to trying out the restaurant, on the same floor as the lobby.

<Content>Comfortable hotel, great location in Tokyo I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The hotel is well located and has the added convenience of a subway entrance in the basement of the hotel. The station is the Ginza Ichome station on the Yurakucho line. Getting to the actual subway still requires a few minutes of walking underground, however. The hotel is located near restaurants and shops and there is a convenience store right outside.I had a room with a double bed and it was comfortable and much larger than I expected. The room had a safe and the bathroom was immaculate. The staff spoke fluent English and were very courteous. The breakfast at the restaurant is good, but pricey. The only disappointment was having to pay for wired internet. I walked to the hotel after arriving at Tokyo Station. The walk took about 15-20 minutes with my bags. Exit the station on Sotobori-Dori and walk south until you see a Wendy鈥檚 on your left. Take a left at the Wendys and walk past the Ginza Itchome subway station. You will find the hotel on your right. The hotel is located near the Tokyo Station, but you have to change trains to get between them. Take one of the trains (not the subway) to Yurakucho Station and then change to the Yurakucho line subway for one stop Ginza Itchome. By the time you make the changes, you aren鈥檛 saving much walking, however.In summary, a comfortable well located hotel with convenient access to the subway. I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to stay in this hotel again.

<Content>A gem in the busy area of Ginza We stayed in Mercure Ginza for 5 nights and could not be happier with their services. All the staff speak good english and offered useful tips for locations  other enquiries.The location is gd, central and very good if you want to go to Tokyo disney, you do not need to go through the busy  often confusing Tokyo station. We went to Nikko  Kinugawa  is convenient as there is a direct line to Tobu Asakusa station.On top of that, there is free internet access  ICE machine!! Which is very helpful during the height of summer.In all, although some might find it a bit dead at night, I personally like the quietness  peace after a long day of sightseeing  walking.

<Content>Mercure Ginza Hotel This hotel is located in the central Ginza district of Tokyo. The rooms are small, the bathroom is small, storage space is minimal and the step up into the bathroom in some rooms is about 50cm (not good for the elderly). The area is nice, with interesting food halls a however the shopping is expensive and mainly includes western or European brands. Also, language can be a real problem with many menus and signs written only in Hiragana or Kanji. Language is a positive for the hotel, as they have a number of English-speaking staff on hand. The view from many hotel rooms is non-existent. Also, the room I stayed in was poorly laid out with a chair blocking access to part of the room. The breakfast was ok, but did not have a huge variety when it came to choice. The hotel also did not have any leisure facilities like a pool or a gym, which was a shame.Overall, I would say the Mercure Ginza hotel is reasonable, but don't go there expecting too much.

<Content>Central Ginza Location Good central location in Ginza shopping district area. I used Metro to get to Hotel either of the Ginza stations are very close by. Taxi from Tokyo station is also a short ride away. I think this hotel is above the normal standard of a Mercure with nice extras in the room such as Japanese bath robe and slippers. Rooms are also nicely decorated and larger than the Mercure hotel at Narita. I thought the room was actually spacious by other standard of Japanese similar star rating hotels. Helpful full English speaking staff. Facility for secure left luggage is available. Hotel area is busy by day but a bit dead by night when the shops close but a very very safe area even late at night. There are many local restaurants around but some are very pricey so do check before.If you want to stay in Ginza at a reasonable price for the area then this hotel is perfect. However the area is a bit characterless compaired to other more busy areas especially by night and more pricey.

<Author>wordDr
<Content>Recommended hotel and a bit of advice My husband and I stayed at this hotel on a business trip to Tokyo. Our clients booked the room for us, based on their knowledge of the area. We agree with the other reviews -- the Mercure is very nice and in a great location. Getting to check-in can be a bit of a challenge. We found that the best approach for the money is to take the Limousine Bus service from the airport to Tokyo Station. The bus service handled all of our bags for us, without our having to negotiate stairs or escalators; then we put our bags directly on a taxi at Tokyo Station. The taxi from Tokyo bus/train station to the hotel was quick and inexpensive. Hotel Reception is on the second floor, so managing the bags into the elevator was cumbersome. A luggage trolly is available in reception, and hotel staff will convey your luggage for you. Internet connection was $9 per day via ethernet. However, there is a McDonalds next door that must have WiiFi because we were often able to access a public wireless line at no charge.We had a deluxe room, which was quite small but adequate. Closet space was minimal.

<Content>Mercure was Super My husband and I visited the Mercure Ginaz in Tokyo for 5 days, it was a superb location, walkable to nearly everything and a great station nearby Ginza Line. Staff at hotel were fabolous,all spoke v ery good english and could not be more helpful with maps, stations and booking airport transfersRoom was smallish but beautifully clean, we had clean kimonos, slippers and towels every day.Breakfast was not included but loads of breakfast shops around, with set breakfasts for all tastes.Will definately stay again with the Mercure group, I have been recommended to join the Accor Group as the discounts in all their hotels are good.Restaurants on top of department stores were fab, the freshest sushi ever at Tsunki Fish Market, everywhere we went was perfection,

<Content>mixed i am a frequent travler spending close to 200 days on the road each year primarily for business in asia. i like 3/4 star hotels that focus on businessmen and i had stayed in the mercure in shanghai which was a great experience. even though i go to tokyo at least once each year, i booked this hotel for the first time because my meetings were at pccw near tokyo train station. the location is great because one is close to the interesting part of the ginza. it was also a 10 minute walk to pccw building.negatives: rooms were incredibly small. because i was travelling with my wife to tokyo who was also working there, we felt that the standard rooms were too claustraphobic and we had to upgrade just to get a bit more space. our original room had maybe 3 feet between the end of the bed and the wall; only one very small window. upgrading resulted in increasing our room rate by nearly 50%.by changing rooms, we also ended up in a smoking rather than non-smoking room. no wireless connection in the room and one needed to use a lan cable to hook up to the internet. the daily internet rate was reasonable, but we ended getting charged twice each day because they charge based on number of computers logging onto the system. when i asked them to deduct one internet charge, they were rude and refused to make the change eventhough my upgrade was $100 per day.because of this behavior at checkout, i will not stay here again.

<Content>in the heart of Ginza Great location if you are taking metro, but can be a bit tiring for female travelers to walk from Yurakucho, the nearest railway station, with a heavy suitcase. Catching a taxi can be a solution but avoid rush hours! Rooms are small but can't complain considering the location and the price. Like most of the Japanese hotels, amenities are fairly good. The bathroom is quite spacious and the bed wide enough which are probably the reasons why I've came back here several times despite the unfriendly staff! I don't recommend the French restaurant, overpriced for the quality. But still you have many options to dine out anyways. . . Enjoy your stay!

<Content>Fantastic location A great hotel, in a fantastic location in an amazing city!!! Reception is on the 2nd floor, so the ground level is nothing special. The 2nd floor is accessed by stairs or lift. The only downside of the hotel is the size of the rooms - rather small, but perfecty formed! The bathroom was snug but immaculate, with clean kimonos and slippers every day. There is a safety deposit box in the room which is free, and a small fridge. Plasma tv on the wall opposite the bed, and a radio alarm clock. Even the toilet was electronic! This hotel is less then 2 minutes from the main street through Ginza, and about 5 minute walk to the subway station. Please use the subway - it's straight forward when you get the hang of it, and very clean and safe. The subway map on the wall inside of the station has numbers in place of the station names - this number is the price you have to pay for your journey. If you decide to travel further there is a 'fare adjustment' machine at each station so you can top up your fare accordingly to enable you to leave the station through the electronic gates. Breakfast in the hotel is good - a little over priced but sets you up for the day in a city where they don't do 'breakfast food' like we do! The city felt very safe at night time, and the road between the hotel and the main Ginza street is well lit and with plenty of people about. I'd stay here again without a doubt. Enjoy Tokyo!

<Content>Good Location - does what is says on the box. We were only staying for one night in Tokyo, we had large amounts of luggage, and this was our first trip to Asia. So we needed something easy.Which is pretty much what we got - having missed the instructions for the hotel buses leaving from narita airport, we caught the train into the central Tokyo. From there we went one stop on the tube (subway) to Ginza. You can go to Ginza Itchome which is directly under the hotel, but for ease, the hotel is still walking distance from Ginza. Once in Ginza station, make a note of how the blocks are numbered on the maps outside the turnstiles. I think on the same map there it also shows where the Mercure Ginza is located. Exit out of A13 which is about a 5 minute walk from where you come out of the turnstiles.As for the hotel itself, the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the bathroom quite spacious. It contains all of the mod-cons (including those famous Japanese toilets with bidet etc on it). Bathrobes and slippers are also provided. The international paper written in English dropped outside our room was a nice touch - at least the staff pay attention. All in all, this is a simple hotel - good for a place to lay your head. We found it relatively easy to get to Haneda airport from there as well.

<Content>Great location, great staff, great food! We stayed at this hotel three times when we were in Japan because we had our flight to Tokyo, then we were in the North, then Tokyo, then Kyoto and Hiroshima and at last back to Tokyo. The staff were great. Always smiling and very helpful. When we arrived, jet-lagged, didn't know if we were eating breakfast, lunch or dinner, we went to the restaurant to eat. I ate salmon. It was the best fish-dinner I have ever had! The breakfast was in the same restaurant. It was buffet-style and there were choices between Japanese or Western breakfast.The hotel is in the middle of the shopping-district. FANTASTIC!When we went to Kyoto and Hiroshima the staff were very kind to collect one of our suitcases.I can not recommend this hotel highly enough!

<Content>Good Hotel, recommended. This is a good and not too pricey hotel at Ginza area. The staff is very efficient and can speak good English. The room is consider big in Japanese standard. I stayed at the Superior Twin Room. The bed is bigger than the normal single bed, each bed can take up to 2 person (of asian size). The location is close to 2 Metro lines and also the JR line. All within walking distance. Very convenient. There is a 24hr Macdonald just next to the hotel, and ample cafes, resturants and eateries at the area.The only complaint that I had is the transfer from the Narita Airport to the hotel. Must change at the Tokyo Station or Ueno Station to Ginza. Nevertheless, I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Not Quite French For a hotel in the heart of Ginza, it is quite tastefully done. Aside from the French motif in the hallway red wallpaper, BW framed photos of Paris scenes, and the random young cynical French male national serving in the dining room, you will not feel schizophrenic about where you are in the world. The rooms are clean, small, yet extra-efficient. Paying just a bit more for the next size up (a few square feet more and still small) was certainly worthwhile, and we only had one suitcase. There is not much of a view, but the almost perfect location more than compensates for that. Just a hop (by foot or cab ride) to the Tokyo JR Yamanote line station and hops to 2 or 3 subway stations with access to the rest of the city (Ginza station was invariably the most useful). The single most important aspect of this hotel鈥檚 location though is the walking distance proximity to the Tsukiji fish market鈥攂est visited at 5:00am, the perfect antidote to jet lag for the American or European visitor!The breakfast is not fantastic but still OK and convenient to have readily available before heading out on a long day. And, certainly good coffee is on offer鈥攚hat else would you expect from the French. As an alternative, Starbucks is around the corner, if you happen to be that type. The best culinary 鈥渟ecret鈥?though is the food court in the basement of the next-door department stores, Takashiyama, Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya. Reasonably priced with a large variety of Japanese fair. No place to sit though鈥攕o takeaway is the deal! The service at the hotel is excellent. The staff is young and ready to give you reliable advice on getting around or anything else you might want to learn about. All-in-all, a perfect hotel, especially if you are visiting Tokyo for the first time and want to feel close to 鈥渆verything鈥?

<Content>City hotel in Ginza The hotel is located in Ginza, close to department stores and offices nearby. A subway exit (Ginza I-chome, exit 11) is lcoated at the basement which opens from 7:00-22:00. It is also walkable from Tokyo train station (20-30 minutes walk) which connects to the Narita Airport in less than an hour. The room is reasonably large in size according to Tokyo standard and the service is ok. However, the breakfast offers very limited choices and there is no other public facilities (gym, business centre etc.) at the hotel, though one notebook computer (with Internet access) is available for use next to the restaurant.

<Content>Tourist class hotel We stayed at the Mercure Ginza for four nights. I have to say I expected a hotel of a better class after having read the reviews here. Mercure is your basic tourist class hotel, nothing more. The location is excellent, however.

<Author>Something-Different!
<Content>Great, if small hotel The Mercure Ginza was quite hard to find in the Ginza area of Tokyo as all the streets do not run in numerical order, however, once found it was more than adequate. The rooms were small but had everything you need, including the all singing, all dancing japanese tiolet that even had heating! A great feature was that you did not have to go through the lobby everytime you went out, as the lobby was situated on the 2nd floor. Security was good as you had to put your room key into a slot to go higher in the lift to your room. The breakfast was buffet style and had everything from rice to muffins. Only objection I would point out would be the area the hotel is in - Ginza is very westernised and has mostly department stores and big grand names such as Cartier, so if you're looking for a 'japanese experience' this wouldn't suit. In saying that, the way the bathrooms are set up in your room is very japanese - sliding doors made from glass in panels and they provide the traditional japanese robes. The rooms were clean and had tea making equipment, tv etc. The bed was very comfortable. The views were of other office/shop skyscrapers.All in all, I probably would use this hotel again.

<Content>Faultless, good value, v. central location Immaculately kept, modern hotel in great location right in the heart of Ginza. We stayed in a double room with 2 queen sized beds and though not large, the room was perfectly adequate and cleaned everyday to perfection. Trendy loo and excellent power shower over the bath, freebies in room and mini-bar with enough room for your own water and food. Very cheap local calls from the room phone was re-assuring when I got the bill. Very varied Eastern and Western buffet breakfast from 6.30- at least 10am is good for the jet-lag and was included in our room-rate. Didn't eat in the hotel otherwise - just so many other places to choose from. All the staff are bi-lingual and very friendly. This was our first trip to Japan and I will stay at the hotel again.Ginza is rather like the Bond Street area - smart shops and boutiques but not very cutting edge. Hotel within 15 min walk of Tokyo Station or short taxi ride. Ask hotel to give you directions back to hotel in Japanese ( even print a map to the hotel before you leave) and print out maps in Japanese as taxi drivers rarely speak any English and certainly don't read it and they don't map-read very well - even with Japanese maps but v. friendly. We took JR Line train from Narita Airport which was superb, v.efficient -just under 1 hr from Airport terminal. Hope you enjoy your trip as much as us.

<Content>Wonderful Location and Reasonably Priced! This hotel is in the perfect location....in the nice shopping and restaurant area of Ginza and walkable to the Tokyo Train Station. Tokyo can be so expensive and so this reasonably priced hotel in such a great location is a jewel. The rooms are not huge but are definitely large enough so you don't feel like you are in a closet. We stayed 2 nights and then went to Kyoto for one night and returned to this hotel for our last night in Tokyo. When we returned for the last night, the check-in person upgraded our room to a larger room which was a nice surprise. There is a computer next to the restaurant for free internet access. Lots of coffee shops nearby for breakfast. Would definitely recommend this to our friends.

<Content>Great little hotel My first trip to Tokyo during one of the hotest Augusts on record. Rooms are smaller than US standards but well thought out. Rooms include refrigerator and safe. Bidet toilet, deep tub shower. In addition to normal soap shampoo, conditioner and shower cap, the hotel also provides tooth brushes, razors and kimono style robes and slippers.It took me a few minutes to figure out how to turn on the lights. You place your door key card in a slot near the entry. The A/C was slient and cooled the room down quicktly. This hotel is probably the quietest hotel room I have ever experienced. The staff was very gracious and extremely helpful. The hotel location is 2 blocks off the main Ginza boulevard. Great location because the hotel is on a small narrow side streed I think it contributes to the quiet of the neighborhood. The breakfast buffett is both Western, with eggs sausage, bacon, yogurt, cereal and Asian with miso soup, rice, fish, and tofu. Green Tea or coffee and a variety of juices. The restaurant also offers a lunch and dinner menu and has a bar in the evenings.The easiest way to get to the Narita airport to this hotel is to take the Narita Express to Yurakucho station. The hotel it is about a 10 minute walk or a quick taxi ride away from the station.There is a Starbucks on the corner as well as a McDonalds close by. I skipped them both as I can that in the US but some of my traveling mates enjoyed getting their latte fix in the morning.I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>fantastic hotel......when we eventually found it! We arrived at tokyo narita airport and found the aiport bus to tokyo the best way to travel......however, the bus didnt drop-off at our hotel but we thought, we can easily walk to our hotel from the last drop-off.........little did we know that the address in tokyo are prob the most unorganised, difficult address's to find in the world! we walked and walked and walked (with our large suitcases) down the most busy shopping street in ginza and found a starbucks - who didnt speak any english but managed to use hand gestures to help us find our hotel.....across the road! so eventually when we arrived, the hotel was modern and high rise (as all the buildings in tokyo) and the staff were friendly and helpful. We got an upgrade to a suite as it was our honeymoon so we had a separate bedroom with double bed and average furniture and coffee and tea facilities. The bathroom was modern and spacious and the toilet was fab......seat warmer, water spray etc. this is the norm in toliets throughout tokyo - public toilets and pub toilets are so clean and pleasent compared to the typical english pub toliet!!!!We were room only so having starbucks and new yorkers cafe around the corner was a great, a coffee and a douhnut is def a holiday breakfast in my eyes and a great start to the sight-seeing day! The hotel had a french themed restaruant, which looked lovely and served breakfast, lunch and dinner but we didnt go in coz there were just so much to do away from the hotel it was just a bed and a base for us really. The hotel as got to be one of the best locations in tokyo, in the heart of ginza and the shopping heaven! very much like the heart of new york, the same atmosphere and busy-ness and great to experience the day to day life of a japanese business-person. There were lots of tourists but mostly japanese rather than wetsern and after a few hours in tokyo you can see why........everything is in japanese........doh.....i feel abit nieve now we have been and come back to think everything else really, we english are guilty of expecting everything to be in the home-tongue and english but not in toyko. And on reflection is its apeal and charm but when its nearly midnight and you are struggling to find something to eat for dinner it can get you down! So my advice is to learn at least conversation japanese or to be able to read a menu in japanese to meet them halfway.After that slight drawback we still saw and experienced everything we wanted to and had the best honeymoon! A few bits and bobs about the city......go to tokyo bay, a beach and cafe's and boat trips are ace. The imperial palace is great, takes you away from the city and gives you a cultural insight to the city too. We also went to Ueno Park, which was lovely but much more touristy - the zoo was good and seeing the temple and pergoda was lovely. We got around on the metro everyday - and night - which was great, easy to use and from the hotel you have three different stations and about 6 different metro lines to choose from so you can get anywhere you want! A night at reponggi hills complex is also worth a visit - modern, gorg restaruants and bars. I would love to go back to tokyo but i will def learn some japanese before i go!

<Content>Perfect location, great staff and good value for money. Our family ( me, my husband and our 3 kids) stayed at this hotel in July 2006 and again in February 2007 as part of our visit to the Sapporo Snow Festival in Hokkaido. The hotel is in a great location where we can walk about 10 mins from the nearest JR station where we got off the Narita express. The underground metro station is just at the corner of the hotel. Although, the underground metro is a bit more expensive than the JR, we found that it's more convenient for our family which have 3 small kids (age 9, 6 and 4) as it's station is less crowded than the JR's. From the hotel, it is also a short walk to the other underground station which we took the train to Haneda airport for a flight to Hokkaido.We booked connecting rooms. Rooms are nice, clean and very small. Anyway, we understand that this is Ginza (the most expensive area of Tokyo). The most impressing thing about the hotel is its staffs. Before my trip started, I had booked a hotel in Hokkaido with one of the Japanese website which I used for the first time. I was not sure about the booking so I emailed Mercure Ginza asking for some suggestions. Without my request, one of the staff had called the hotel in Hokkaido and confirmed everything for us. This is really impressed me. I plan to go to Japan again next year for Tateyama - Japan Alps and will definetly stay at the Mercure Ginza Hotel again as part of the trip.

<Content>Great stay in Ginza at Mercure We stayed at the Mercure Ginza July 12-18, 2007. This great little hotel is tucked away behind the Matsuya Department Store just off the main Ginza St. Rooms are compact, yet highly functional and comfortable. We were on the 8th floor, and it was very quiet. Easy to walk to all great Ginza shopping, and to the Tokyo Station. Great rates, and their breakfast is filling and has lots of choices, Western or Japanese! Can't go wrong here.

<Content>Heated toilet seats - thumbs up Booked this place via the accor.com web site which, in my opinion, provides the best web deals. Good location right in Ginza - not the most happening part of Tokyo, that's for sure, but it was very convenient for subway and train access, plus the local department stores all have basement food courts with incredibe food at good value. Good coffee places nearby for your morning fix. I liked the local restaurants in the area - we tried everything from noodle places to sushi to teppanyaki and if Tokyo is supposed to be super-expensive on food these places certainly were not. The rooms were huge and I loved the heated toilet seats and the mirror that was always clear no matter how much steam was in the room. It's those little things that make Japan so great!

<Content>Great location, great hotel ...... Excellent hotel in the middle of Ginza. Great location easy to find your way around. Very helpful and very friendly staff. Standard rooms are rather small and therefore it is advisable to reserve a deluxe room. Rooms on the 12th floor are very quiet.

<Content>Accor's secret Only half of the taxi drivers will find it without mistake, but it is right there in the centre of Ginza, one block from Ginza dori. . A reasonably priced 4 star hotel , directly behind Matsuya department store and with underground access to the Yurakucho line. Expect perfect French service with that special Japanese smile added to. Europeans, used to the portfolio of Accor chain, feel at home from the first minute. As a welcome gift we received French biscuits from a top brand French pastry shop nearby.Small reception and lobby on 2nd floor (use the elevator !). Use the free internet desk and (like many French expatriates) have a lunch in their French restaurant before strolling over to Luis Vuitton (just around the corner) or Printemps department store. Many French companies having their offices around this place, hold their business meetings there.The rooms are European size, the furniture is new, pictures and decoration deliver some mixed Tokyo/Paris-atmosphere. Very comfortable bathroom (incl. Electronic WC). French luxury stores as well as 24 h shops, coffeeshops and fast food chains around.Most of Ginza offices (e.g. Renault Nissan) in walking distance. 5 min. by taxi to Tokyo station. From there you can take the airport bus or train to Narita or stay overnight at Mercure Narita hotel for an early morning flight.Highly recommendable !

<Content>Basic Very Clean Helpful Excellent location for the price, walk straight out to Ginza shopping district. Expect Ginza to be like any shopping highstreet - as close to paris or London in shopping choice, not as nice as Michigan Av Chicargo IL. Very Spectacular when lit at night.Hotel staff very polite helpful, room upgrade given as we had large luggage and a stroller, however extra 拢20 added to have a bed for little one - despite having booked this - advised no way HS would allow extra bed in first room. Bathrooms clean lots of towels/toiletries. Small - but more space than we were expecting for the money. Hotel restuarant was OK not great - very strange take on French Food (not really remotely french)Use the coach service to the airport terminal in the centre of Tokyo to get out to the airport - cheap regular and runs ontime.

<Content>Excellent hotel; stunning location! Our stay at the Mercure was excellent. The rooms are a good size for Tokyo and spotlessly clean. The staff was courteous and spoke excellent English. As for the location, it is literally a 2 minute walk from Ginza dori, the main street in Ginza, a very posh district in Tokyo full of designer shops, eateries and neon lights at night. Recommended!

<Content>great location Our family with 3 adults and 3 kids (Age7,6 and 4) stay in 2 cconnecting rooms. The room was very clean and the decoration are in good condition. However if you have big suitcases beware of the tiny room (which are all the same in tokyo). The location of the hotel are excelllent. There is starbuck around the corner and Mcdonald is on the ground floor of the hotel. The big deparment store (Matsugaya) is 2 blocks away.We came from Narita by airport limusine, get off at Tokyo station and take a taxi ( one taxi is enough for our group!!!!) It cost about 700 yen only. I do recommend every one to stay at this hotel but don't carry large suitecase.

<Content>great hotel choice We were very happy with this hotel. Number one on our list of reasons was the service. Everyone at the desk was so helpful and friendly. They all spoke English quite well. Our luggage was delayed, and the staff went out of their way to help us, even arranging for our luggage to be transfered when it was delivered by the airlines to the wrong hotel. They were also great about helping us map out directions to various sights etc. We liked the location of the hotel. It was 5 minutes taxi ride from Tokyo station, making access eay from the hotel to the Narita Express and other trains for trips outside of Tokyo. The Ginza area was fun, with lots of stores, galleries, places to eat. The hotel was close to 3 subway lines. The room, while not huge, was a decent size. We didn't like the step up to the bathroom, which seems to be the design in Japanese hotels. We also found this in our hotel in Kyoto, but the ste up at the Mercure was steeper. We had breakfast at the hotel, which weas quite anice buffet. We were able to get a discounted rate on the room and breakfast by contacting the reservation desk atby e-mail at the hotel directly. Anyhow, we would definately stay there again-wish we were going back soon! P.S. We had a non-smoking room and did not encounter any problems as outlined in one of the posts we read here.

<Content>Great choice I really enjoyed my stay at the Mercure Ginza. This is a quiet hotel just off the main Ginza-dori, quite a charming area with small boutiques, coffee shops and a fruit stand on the block. Subway station accessible from the basement level. The staff were courteous, my room was very clean and a decent size by Tokyo standards. Very comfortable mattress. Good breakfast buffet. I have stayed at more expensive hotels in Tokyo, but prefer the Mercure Ginza.

<Content>Good three star but beware of smoking rooms I booked this hotel room as part of a package. I read the reviews on this site and thought it was a good bet. When I booked it I strongly requested a non-smoking room.When we checked in I asked whether this had been honoured and the woman on the front desk assured me we were in a nonsmoking room on a non-smoking floor.We went to the room (on the 3rd floor) and everything was good. Clean, comfy bed, nice bathroom. The room is very small but adequate for 3 star. The next day however, things started to go bad. They only give you the bare minimum, one towel each, they don't replace the used shampoo and I had to ask for it. The TV has only 1 English channel (CNN). I am not there for the TV by any means but it is nice to watch a bit before going to sleep of a night. The worst however was that when we got back into the room on the second night it reeked of smoke! So much that went we both walked in we started coughing. We had been given a room that had a door into the next room. This was locked but I think the smoke was getting underneath the door or coming through the air-conditioning system, I am not sure.I rang up reception very confused as we had been told it was a nonsmoking floor and they said that no, I was in a smoking room on a smoking floor. When I said that obviously I had been told a lie then, they refused to acknowledge this or apologize. I requested another room and they said this was not possible. I asked for compensation of some kind and they said that was not possible either. In the end they gave me 1 hour later checkout. Not much good as far as I am concerned. We went out for dinner and they said they would come in and air out the room. When we came back it was a bit better, but could still smell the smoke. We were woken up though at about 6 am the next morning from the really strong smell of smoke. Obviously someone had got up pretty early in the room next to us. Now I understand that sometimes it is not possible to give everyone a non-smoking room, but if you are going to put non smokers into a smoking room you have to at least make sure that they are able to stay in there comfortably. It was so bad I developed a sore throat and had to leave the room.I will never be going back to this place and would not recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great value for central Tokyo Lots of other comments tell you about the high standard of the rooms. I just want to repeat how wonderfully situated this hotel is. Just around the corner and you are on the main department store strip in Tokyo - their equivalent of Midtown Manhattan. Three metro stations to choose from (I don't think we ever used the one in the basement) plus a stop on the JR Yamanote line about five minutes walk away. Ten minutes walk to the Tsukiji Fish market. We only tried the buffet breakfast once as it was quite expensive - you need to be very hungry for it to be worthwhile; it's more like a brunch. However on our other seven days there we had coffee and croissants or Danish in a different caf茅 every day. Do note that taxi drivers don't know this hotel and even their little Japanese map on the website doesn't help much. I ended up giving the driver instructions when we arrived the first day. I used to ask them to bring us to the Matsuya dept store and we would walk the rest of the way (two blocks, and Ginza blocks are much, much narrower than NY ones). So I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.
