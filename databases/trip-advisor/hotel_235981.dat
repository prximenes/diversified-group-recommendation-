<Content>It All Depends What You Want... We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour group, and as with most things in life, it is dependent upon one's expectations. I would say this is probably closer to a 2.5 star hotel, rather than a 3 star hotel, and while we liked it just fine, we would not opt to stay here again on our own time.Because I was traveling with my father, we were assigned a 3-bed, 2-room suite, #37, which was really nice. The rooms were clean and well-maintained, and the maids cleaned it daily. The shower is a good size, and one of the more well-behaved showers I have experienced in Italy, but the toilet seat is awkwardly large and I found it especially uncomfortable. We were never able to open our large windows, but since there was only a street and another building outside, we did not mind too much. The downside of being on the outside wall was we did pick up a lot of traffic noise, as well as the city's bells. Not enough to really be a problem, but someone who is sensitive to noise will probably want to request a room on the opposite side.Breakfast is served in a bright and open terrace area on the top floor of the hotel, but not on the tower. It is self-service of pastries, yogurt, and fruit, as well as water and juice. On each table is an additional basket of pastries, and the servers will bring you coffee, tea, or cappucino. The desk staff is very helpful and friendly, and will hold your key for you when you go out, if you wish. There is wi-fi available, and a computer where one can purchase 5 euros/hour of internet time. The cheapest internet points in Florence are near Santa Maria Novella, and on Via Faenza. The hotel itself is practically around the corner from the Ponte Vecchio, which puts it in the more pricy tourist zone, but Florence is so compact I found it well worthwhile to venture after the cheaper internet cafes.Because I prefer smaller, homey BB style hotels, I would probably not have picked this hotel on my own, nor would I stay there again. However, someone who wants to stay in an old tower building, in a safe, clean hotel with a helpful, English-speaking desk staff, could do a lot worse.

<Content>Highly Recommend affordable Hotel Hotel Alessandra which is located across the street from hotel Torre Guelfa was booked and so my husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. What a upgrade. Not only was it less expensive but this hotel has more charm. Our room was huge with vulted ceilings and our bathroom was even bigger. For breakfast we sat in a indoor terrace on top of the tower. The staff was nice and very helpful. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quite, safe, and clean hotel to stay at in down town Florence.

<Content>A real dump.... My wife and children were in Italy for three weeks, from July through early August. The hotels we stayed in during our trip ranged from decent to surprisingly nice EXCEPT for the Torre Guelfa. It is not that the hotel did not seem quaint when we first walked into the tower where the hotel was located, but it was after taking the elevator up to our floor did we realize that the hotel's own website was completely misleading. The hotel seemed dingy and although our suite was large, it appeared not to have been updated in a very long time. The walls needed to be repainted and the carpets were old and stained. We were not impressed at all.But the best was yet to come. When we awoke the next day for their so-called delicious buffet breakfast on the much talked about terrace with it's amazing view of Florence, we were instead greeted by two people who led us to a third floor table. The food being offered consisted of a small basket of bread and fruit, which looked completely unappetizing, and the coffee was terrible, and when we asked if we could eat on the terrace, they told us that was not possible. We left without eating, and took a walk up to the terrace on the roof of the hotel. It seemed that no one had been there in ages. The iron tables were rusted, and it was just so dirty. What brought our attention to the hotel in the first place was the fact that we could eat our breakfast or have a drink on this terrace. We realized that all of the pictures on their website were just totally misleading. It was a real letdown.After that, we just could not wait to leave. We did not stay in the hotel much in our four days in Florence, but like all travel destinations, it makes every day better when you appreciate and like the hotel you are staying in.BEWARE. Find another hotel!!!!!!

<Content>Pleasantly surprised The Hotel Torre Guelfa was in a perfect location for first time visitors to Florence and for those who had visited before. Easy to see the important sights and sites from this ideal location and the price was reasonable. The rooms were large and had simple but comfortable furnishings. The breakfast was more than adequate. The staff was efficient and pleasant.I would definitely stay here again.

Wonderful desk help...especially the gray haired afternoon gentleman. Yu could not do beter if you truly want an Italian style hotel and not a Westin. Gong to the tower is a must.

<Content>Stay away from the apartment across the street!!! Overall the hotel was okay... just okay. Our breakfast was decent. We booked our room at the last minute and the hotel concierge told us that there was an apartment available owned by the hotel just across the street. We were led into some dark, desolate building next to some offices. The hot water wasn't working for some reason and the shower was cold. Not luke warm but COLD!!!! The bathroom had a horrible stink as a resident cat urinated all over the bathroom. We told the hotel front desk that we couldn't stay here overnight and he got us a room at the main hotel. We wished we had better experience of Florence. We also got a traffic ticket one year later for driving into some historic zone. Watch out!!!!

<Content>Great Tower, Good Hotel I stayed here over Christmas 2006 and Christmas 2007 on family vacations. It's a lovely building, but the rooms are a bit small considering the price. What makes it unique it that it's the tallest private building (apparently) in the old part of Florence which makes the roof something truly special. Location-wise it couldn't be much better and the service was adequate. All that being said, on each trip I also stayed at the Hotel Alessandra just down the street which I couldn't recommend more highly and which (on account of having a few more stairs) is a good deal less expensive and has much bigger rooms. So you won't go wrong staying here but you can do a little better there.

<Content>Okay but not great We just returned from a two-night stay here. Our room was fairly large but had limited storage. There was no view, but that wasn't a problem as we weren't expecting one. Everything was clean but the carpet and furnishings seemed worn so the room was not very cheerful. The bathroom sink and tub leaked. It was quite warm and there was an air-conditioning unit on the wall, but no way to turn it on. We couldn't open the windows at night because of all the street noise so the room was stuffy. Breakfast was good and the view from the tower is indeed wonderful. However, we couldn't really enjoy it because both levels of the tower were always taken over by goups who sat and smoked while enjoying their wine. We felt that the welcome and further contact with people at the desk was very perfunctory and at times unfriendly. We have traveled in Italy before and feel this hotel is over-rated. There are other hotels in Florence that give better value for the money.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic Spent two fantastic weeks at this charming Hotel. Great location, close to Piazza Signoria, steps from the Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio. First off room, was fantastic, unique shape to it and very large. Old/modern feel to our room. Washroom, modern, clean, excellent shower, with two shower heads. Breakfast was perfect, with brioce, yogurt, juices and fantastic cappuccino. Wait staff was great, very friendly and courteous. Staff, especially Allesandro, was amazing. Extremely knowledgeable with information regarding great restaurants that don't break the bank. Also, gave us a wonderful stroll down from Piazza Michaelangelo. Tower was the highlight, breathtaking views across the Arno, of the Duomo and Palazzo Vecchio. Could spend hours up there!!!!Little travel tip, head down the Borgo Apostoli in the opposite direction of the Uffizi, to the Ponte Santa Trinita, less crowded and beautiful view of the Ponte Vecchio. Best place to catch a Tuscan sunset with your loved one!!!

<Content>Renaissance memories We happened to find this Hotel while travelling throughout Tuscany . We appreciated its atmosphere which took us back to the early renaissance period, especially the lounge and the tower with its unique view.We thought the people at the hotel were friendly and helpful, also because they all spoke English. The hotel is in a perfect location right in the middle of the old medieval town.We suggest to whoever wants a hotel which is not a standard one, to stay here - you'll love it!!

<Content>We would never go to this hotel again. The Torre Guelfa leaves a lot to be desired. Even though my husband and I paid a lot of money to stay here, the room reminded me of a dungeon. The bathroom was extremely small and the sink for the bathroom was in the bedroom. Our room was located on the side of an alley, so we were awoken to the noise from the leather market carts every morning. We really could not wait until our stay in Florence was over. The best part of the hotel was the rooftop wine bar which does have a beautiful view of the Duomo and lovely sunsets.

<Content>More than expected My husband and I stayed at the Torre Guelfa in mid October. having read some of the reviews on this site the week before we went, I was somewhat apprehensive. We were most pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to a huge clean room with a canopied bed and a huge clean bathroom. There was no shower stall but rather a vert large tub with a shower hose (which is typical in Europe.) The decor of the room was very atmospheric and I felt like I was staying in a 15thc palazzo (which it is) Our room which faced the main street was quiet due to the double windows which did in fact open. We found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant . The breakfast was simple and nicely presented. While it is true that there were only other Americans staying there-they were lovely The view from the tower is incredible and the public rooms are beautiful. When we return to Florence,we will most definitely stay there again

<Content>Great location, fair hotel Room was very clean, but sparsely furnished and carpet had stains which gave room a tacky, old feeing; bed was comfortable and bathroom small but ok with great shower/tub. No view out the window, but didn't spend much time in the room at all. Hotel was in a great location, close to all the major sites, good restaurants nearby and felt very safe walking to and from hotel at night. Breakfast was probably our least favorite thing at this hotel, just bread/croissants, crackers. Some fresh fruit in bowl was old, unappetizing and just added to the disappointing breakfast. However, that being said, the capuccino and bread actually carried us through to lunch. We took some great photos from the tower rooftop while enjoying a beer and glass of wine. Not a bad hotel but we probably would choose another hotel on our next trip to Florence. Also, there were ALL americans here - where do the Italians stay?!

<Content>Hotel Torre Guelfa The Hotel Torre Guelfa is in a very central location with only a 2-3 minute walk to get to the Ponte Vecchio, Uffizi, and the Doumo. We stayed in Room 1 during our three night stay and the bed was two twin beds put together to make a king size bed. We did have an excellent view from our windows to the Palazzo Vecchio. We were able to open the windows and shutters to let a breeze come in the room. The bathroom was updated with a new shower, toilets, and sink which was very nice. The room was quite large.The only complaint I have is with the breakfast. It is a little basket with about 3 different breads in it and thats it. Only bread with your choice of water or orange juice.The staff is very friendly and they also recommended some great restuarants. They also called and confirmed a reservation I had with a tour company. If you want a genuine hotel experience stay here, if you want something more modern you might want to think about someplace else.

<Content>Extremely Helpful Staff My husband  I along with my brother  his wife stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in Sept 2007. My luggage had been lost  the airlines called the front desk  left a message indicating I needed to come to the airport to retrieve my suitcase. I was exasperated. I had been without my luggage for 4 days  now I had to take a taxi to the airport to get my bags! Fortunately, the front desk staff called my airline  persuaded them to get my bags delivered to the hotel. I was thrilled. The staff went above  beyond ordinary service. The location of this hotel along with their high level of service makes it an outstanding choice in Florence! Sincerely, Becky Freed

<Content>Never Go Back Again My wife and I stayed here from Sept 17th through Sept 19th and I have to say that I was EXTREMELY disappointed. From the tub (not a shower) that had a hose to clean yourself off to the creepy closet that seemed out of SAW the movie. I was eaten up by bugs at night and the breakfast was something comparable to a Motel 6. The staff was nice but the room was terrible. I have stayed in pricely hotels (Ritz and Waldorf Astoria, Palace in NY) and in Motels like the aforementioned Motel 6. I am sad to say that this stay was MORE comparable to that of a stay at the Motel 6. I found a couple of hairs in the tub and we were only given 2 clean towels - no hand towels......just 2 shower towels. As for the furniture, there was a badly stained chair placed in the middle of the room. The bed was hard but I came to expect that in European or hotel beds sometimes so that wasn't a big deal to us. One last thing, the windows were sealed shut and the room seemed dark and creepy. I have to say that our stay at Torre Guelfa severely damaged my view of Florence - I don't know if I would ever want to return to the city let alone the hotel.

<Content>Charming hotel in a great location We loved this hotel and the staff! The reviews in Frommers , Travel Advisor,  Rick Steves convinced me to give it a try; I was rewarded with a lovely experience. My three adult children, my son's finance  I went to Italy for 14 days on July 1. It was a once-in-a-lifetime trip. We wanted an Italian experience, not Holiday Inn in Italy. Torre Guelfa exceeded our expectations. From the enormous wooden, castle-like doors at the street level, tile floors, lovely common areas, and friendly staff we were treated to Italian ambience. Each of our rooms was unique. We stayed on the first floor in three rooms. Bathrooms were small, showers-only, but by no means the smallest bathroom we experienced in Italy! Everything was clean and in good repair. The air-conditioning in the rooms was a welcome relief from the July heat. Our rooms overlooked the front door on ground level. The hotel is about 1.5 blocks from the Ponte Vecchio so the street can be quite lively at night. Light sleepers might have trouble with the 1st floor. We were there 5 nights and only one night did the noise level rise to the degree I found it difficult. (Large group of young people at a wine bar across the street, spilled out to the street.) It is also easy walking distance to most things in Florence. Pitti Palace  the Uffizi are just down the street. In fact, we walked everywhere in Florence. The tower offers a fabulous view of the city. Watching the sun set from this vantage point is breath-taking. The staff also helped us book a tour and provided suggestions on places to visit. Most of the staff we encountered are fluent in English which was very helpful. The only criticism I have is that the breakfast eating area is quite small and there is no real system for identifying who is next. We had tours booked early in the morning, with 5 in our group, it was challenging to get us all in to breakfast before we had to leave, so twice we left without breakfast. Even with this inconvenience, our stay was fabulous. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, lovely setting Location of this hotel is wonderful. Breakfast room and tower are just lovely, sitting rooms for reading and e-mail are luxurious. Room was oversized and more like a suite, and price was very reasonable in the guest house (1st floor). Room was clean, but bathroom was very small and smelled, which was somewhat unpleasant. Personnel were very accomodating and hotel was family friendly.

<Content>Greatly enjoyed the apartment! Before we left to go on our trip to Florence, we checked out the reviews on the Torre Guelfa apartment. We were a bit skeptical at first as there were conflicting opinions from previous guests. I have to say that we found our experience to be absolutely wonderful! Although the hallways leading up to the apartment can be dark at night, there are light switches on the walls and a lit elevator. The rooms inside were very spacious and the ceilings were tall to accomodate lofts in each of the two rooms. The windows opened up to a charming cobblestone street where we frequently heard the clip-clop of horse drawn carriages. Nothing can beat the proximity factor the apartment has to town! It's close to everything! From the hotel manager to the housekeeper, everyone was friendly and helpful. We'd stay in the apartment again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Wonderful Stay This hotel is well-run and wonderfully located. It is well within walking distance to most of the tourist sites in Florence. The staff, while not overly friendly, was helpful and answered all of our questions. Breakfast was yummy. One morning, we had to wait to eat because the smallish room was filled. However, we only waited a few minutes.The tower is amazing and well worth the climb.Our room was lovely, clean and spacious. We will send our friends to this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>The highlight of our time in Florence My two friends and I stayed at the Hotel Torre Guelfa in May 2007. We had a neat room and a big bathroom. The service was great and the breakfast was good. The best part was the tower. We had some wine that was not nearly as expensive as we thought it would be and being up there for sunset made the whole world feel perfect! We loved everything about our stay!!! I can't wait to go back with my husband.

<Content>Best Rooftop Views Of Florence We stayed 2 nights at the Torre Guelfa in Florence about a year ago. When the cab dropped us off, I thought we were at the wrong place. You go through some heavy metal gates and take the elevator to the reception room on the upper floors.What a place!! A magnificent old stairway leads to the rooftop where you get the most amazing view of Florence from a bird's eye. In the afternoon you can go to the rooftop, have a glass of wine (hosted by the hotel) up and soak it all up. Florence is a busy, busy city--motorcycles, mopeds, traffic mixed in with all that amazing culture---and having a peaceful part of the city all to yourself made the experience one to remember.Customer service was excellent, the rooms were clean, and we left feeling we had gotten our money's worth. If I get the opportunity to return to Florence, I'll be here--on the rooftop.

<Content>Torre Guelfa apartments We loved the apartment across the street. We had stayed several times at the torre guelfa and one year when we wanted to go with another couple the hotel was all booked. The apartment was highly recommended so we thought we'd take a chance. It was a little thinnly furnished but the rooms were huge and we just pretended like it was our own place. We moved the furniture around making it feel like our own home., bought a few vases of flowers and threw open the windows. Of course, we put everything back before we left. We had a ball in own home in Florence for 9 days and we even got a discount. I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.Susan

<Content>Eccentric but wonderful From the moment you arrive at Torre Guelfa, you know that it's going to be a different experience -- you have to buzz up to the third-floor reception area to open an enormous iron gate (assuming that the ancient wooden doors to this palazzo are open, which is not always the case!). However, an unusually friendly and hospitable welcome awaits once you take the elevator up. The hotel has some wonderful public areas, including an enormous, beautifully decorated lounge and, yes, a medieval tower that offers a spectacular view over the city accompanied by a glass of wine in the evenings. Sunset on the tower is one of my best memories from this trip.We stayed in a wonderful junior suite, which included a tiny ancient bathroom (used only to house the mini-bar these days), a completely modern new bathroom, gigantic windows (but with no view given the narrow streets of Florence), and an arch though a four-foot wall to connect the bedroom and living spaces.The hotel also boasts an unbeatable location near the Ponte Vecchio. Breakfast was the one soft spot in an otherwise wonderful experience. The breakfast room is small and crowded, so sometimes you have to waite for a table. And the selection of food, while adequate, is limited to yogurt, rolls, croissants, and jams.

<Content>What a gem! My mother, six month old daughter, and I recently stayed at this wonderful hotel. Stepping into the main door you feel as though you've been invited to stay in a friends private home. This is not a fancy grand hotel but what it lacks in initial aesthetics it makes up for in comfort, service, and location. We loved our room with canopy bed and huge bathroom. Each day began with breakfast delivered to our room and ended on the tower deck with overwhelmed views of the city and surrounding countryside. Our experience was perfect until the last night when my wallet was stolen off of me--a complete nightmare. But, in the midst of my turmoil I found comfort and rest at the Hotel Torre Guelfa. The staff made every accomodation, gave valuable suggestions, and extended the concern of a loved one. I look forward to returning to this gem of a hotel and highly recommend anyone to make it there home away from home in Florence.

<Content>Do not stay at the Apartment I should have heeded the negative review of the Hotel's apartment across the street. It had the charm and appeal of a public bathroom. There was no tv and was barely furnished. I hated every second we were there and had 2 awful nights of sleep. Opt to either stay directly at the hotel OR at another hotel altogether. Also, the guy at the front desk was jerky when he demanded I pay cash for the apartment. When I offerred to go to the Bancomat, he then told me to forget about it.

<Content>Questions about Torre Guelfa Our family, two adults  two teenagers, has stayed at Torre Guelfa's apartment across the street on three occasions. We are happy with the apartment because we are familiar with it - however, this time the light in the elevator was burned out and not replaced during the three days we were there. I think it was an electrical problem. At night, getting off the elevator, had we not known where the light switch was, we would have been completely in the black. And the shower needed the drain fixed - which they tried but did not fix, while there.We always travel with either my sister or my mother-in-law, who stays in the hotel itself. My son stayed there last summer on his own. Over the years, I know how much Torre Guelfa has raised its rates. A few years ago, they signed up with Florenceby to make its reservations. You can't go to Torre Guelfa directly to make the reservations. Each year, the price is raised. What started out at 100 euros a night six years ago is now 150 euros a night (for a single). Some of the rooms at Torre Guelfa are worth the extra money, but this time my sister got a room that was not worth that much money. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. It's right in the middle of the city. Very convenient. We love the tower that looks out over Florence. The common living room is very nice. But the rooms are kind of random. You can have a pretty nice one or, like my sister, pay 150 euros for a very small, single room.We have fond memories of Torre Guelfa. However, when I travel next time I think I will do some more research with TripAdvisor to see what else is available for the money.

<Content>A home away from home! Wonderful hotel and staff! Let me begin by saying that I am a discerning traveller. I do A LOT of research before traveling to any destination and I seek out the best value for my hard earned dollar. I am also a well seasoned traveler. I have stayed in everything from youth hostels (in my teen-age years) to 5 star hotels world-wide. I am also extremely honest about my reviews and for every good letter/review I write there are probably two negative ones. So when I say that this was a delightful hotel with a wonderfully attentive staff you can know that I mean it. I began by planning our eight day trip to Florence more than a year and a half in advance. From the day that I contacted the hotel I recieved timely and professional assistance and advice. Of course I had to endure a bit of teasing from Carlo for my advance planning when I arrived--apparently most travellers are not as organized (or uptight about planning) as I am. Service -- We shipped luggage in advance of our arrival- no problems. Had luggage picked up after we left-- no problems. I wanted dinner reservations for the first two nights of our stay made in adavance of our arival- no problem. In fact all we had to do was tell them where we wanted to eat for dinner each morning and at what time and they made the reservation-- no problems. Rooms -- I found these to be a great value in comparison to all of my other researched options. We actaually booked two rooms (my mother and aunt travelled with my husband and myself). Both rooms were on par with rooms we've stayed in throughout Europe. Mid size, tidy. Not huge and not elaborate. SImple, well appointed and clean. But do bring an alarm clock. We stayed in Room 13 and my Mom and Aunt stayed in Room 10. We stayed at the Torre Guelfa for 8 nights and could not have been happier. Yes, you can hear people in the alley below if you leave your windows open. But with the windows closed -- nothing. A/C worked great -- it was starting to get warm. Beds were comfortable -- not the sleep number bed we have at home but we slept comfortably for over a week. Bathroom was reasonably sized and comaparible wtih every other European bathroom I have had in Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, England or Scotland. Breakfast -- This is perfectly on par with any breakfast that we have received anywhere throughout Europe. The rest of the world (save Scotland) does not eat the same kind of breakfast that Americans do and nor should you expect the same as you get at home. Breakfast at the Torre Guelfa consisted of staff serving you a choice of coffee/espresso or tea, croissants, and rolls with butter, jam and nutella. Grapefruit, orange (and some other kind of juice) were always available as were your choice of various yogurts. And basically you could have as much as you wanted. All was served in a delightfully sunny room with cloth napkins and very attentive staff. My only complaint: I have wide hips and the chairs were a bit tight to sit in. I'm not quite sure what other reviewers problem with this breakfast is because if they have traveled at all this is the same breakfast served just about anywhwere and is more than acceptable. In fact you have to search long and hard to find any place that serves eggs and bacon -- for this try: Guibbe Rosso in the Piazza della Republicca and for 15 Euros you can get a traditional American breakfast.Location -- the location of this hotel couldn't be more perfect. Everything was within short walking distance: Ponte vecchio, Uffizi, Bargello, Accademia, Piazza della signoria and repubblica, fantastic designer and off brand shopping; fantastic restaurants -- you name it. The farthest we had to walk was up to the Mercato Centrale and that was at most 20 mins leisurely. Let me also say that I am not in the best of shape so if I can do it just about anyone can! Safety and Security: I read trip advisor and just about every guide book imaginable before heading to Italy. Afetr reading a few things from folks I admit I had some serious concerns: pick pockets, gypsies, cleanliness, the language barrier and personal safety. I was there for 8 days and I can honestly say that I was floored with 1) how amazingly clean the city is. I was hard pressed to even find dog poop on the streets-- we did once and the shop owners seemed disgusted and it was a point of major discussion! 2) The alley ways-- these are numerous but extremely well lit at night and I felt safer there than I do here in Northern VA!! I am always cautious about my personal safety at home and abroad but I felt VERY safe and at ease while walking these alleys-- in fact we found MANY great restaurants stowed away in these alleys. Borgo SS. Apostoli (the street the torre Guelfa sits on) is very well lit and we wandered it at all hours of the day and night. The hotel also has a secured doorway and gate-- although I'm not sure why-- probably to keep curiosity seekers out more than anything.As for Gypsies and pick pockets-- we had NO problems. The women were often at the Duomo and Baptistry working the crowd for loose change, but as long as you're firm with a Grazie, Non! Vai! They leave you alone. Oh and the police are everywhere at the key tourist spots. Extras: Reccommendations from Staff- we were on the look-out to buy a few items while in Flroence and after a few days of looking we weren't finding what we wanted. Finally we just asked Kamal (the night shift at the Torre Guelfa) and he gave us some excellent recommendations and we got VERY good prices and excellent service from the merchants we went to-- paying less than at the touristy places we kept finding. The Tower! Everything that everyone says about this tower is true. It is a key selling point for this hotel. In fact I liked everything about the common areas of this hotel. They all have a very old world feel and look just as they do in the photos.Summary -- Everything about this hotel's web site rings true in real life. They don't pretend to be the five star Grand Hotel and they aren't. What they are is a delightful hotel with solid service and an attentive staff. They won't fall over themselves kissing up to you, but if you ask for something, it will be done accurately and efficiently. If you ask for guidance, they will give it graciously. What they do, they do well and the price is just right for someone who wants a full service hotel with character that won't break the bank. The bottom line is that I loved this hotel for every one of the eight days that I stayed there and when we return we will not hesitate for one second about where to stay. I hope that this detailed and accurate review helps you to plan a wonderful visit to Florence, I know that I found these reviews helpful when planning my trip. Ciao!! And Buona Viaggio!!

<Content>Hotel's apt. across the street The hotel has apt. accomodations across the street in addition to rooms at hotel. Don't stay there. The only space available was one of the apts. which we were told was nice by the staff. Wrong, it was terrible. No telephone, no contact with hotel staff, totally cut off from hotel. Accomodations were a bed and chair with drape thrown over it. We said we can't stay in the room, desk said okay, no charge, then called owner who said we would be charged full rate! Nightmare!

<Content>An Amazing View ... Not an Amazing Hotel This hotel is not located in the best of places - at night you can hear people walking down the little street screaming and laughing. So, don't expect to sleep much at this hotel. Also, the street is quite dark at night so I wouldn't venture alone. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel doors. However, the room we stayed in was quite large. It had a four post bed and a sitting area. There was a tub with a shower (but with no curtain so you have to hold the hold the shower head and freeze when you exit from the water). But it was made of marble as well as the sinks - very spacious. The toilet, though, was in a separate closet in the room and was a very very tight squeeze. Breakfast was plain - some dry bread with butter and some yogurts and juice. But the best thing about this hotel is the view from the roof. You have to climb some stairs to get there but the fatigue is worth the climb. You have a 360 degree view of Florence, and the red dome (Duomo) is staring right at you. We took some amazing pictures during a clear day. It was a breathtaking sight. We're glad we stayed there just for the view, but I most likely wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Not worth the price We booked a triple based on the incredible looking website. It was somewhat expensive for our budget, but it was a birthday treat, so we wanted to spluge. The room first supplied looked nice, but the third bed was a pull-out couch with a mattress so thin (2 inches) you could feel every bar. When we mentioned it to management, their response was that no one else had complained... After much protesting, they gave us a second, single room, which was musty and moldy. Very disappointing. Also, there was only enough hot water for one person to take a bath. After that, there was NO hot water for SEVERAL hours. Definitely not a good value and not even a good splurge. We checked out a day early and high-tailed it to another, more simple hotel and were much more content.

<Content>A wonderful small hotel The Hotel Torre Guelfa lived up to the wonderful reviews. We just returned from a 3-night stay in this hotel in Florence. It was wonderful. The 360 degree offered by the hotel tower was breathtaking. Sadly it was March so a bit too chilly to sit and enjoy but I can imagine that in warmer weather the tower terrace and tower top area would be filled with guests enjoying the evening view. Our room was large and comfortable - the bath was tiny, tiny - but this is expected and was not a problem for us. We were grateful to have warm showers and a safe clean place to stay. I will stay here again.Also - this hotel is located on the third floor but there is a modern elevator that is easily accessed.

<Content>This place is wonderful After reading some very negative reviews of this hotel prior to going on holiday, it was with some trepidation that we drove up to the entrance, unloaded the car, parked it in the nearby garage as advised in advance by the very helpful hotel reception (incidentally, directions from the motorway to the front door were faultless) and stepped through the impressive solid wood street door. Our first two nights were in the Tower Room. This is a slight misnomer, as it's more a roof terrace, but it's romantic and wonderful, with great views and did not disappoint. The actual tower, with its hotel bar, is SO romantic, sitting at sunset enjoying a prosecco and looking over the Duomo, the Ponte Vecchio - all the sights of Florence. The receptionists were very handy with great restaurant recommendations, they got us tables in packed places at short notice and we were greeted at each place they'd booked like long lost friends. Our second two nights were in a standard room - it was fine, quite large, lovely antique furniture. If you want a romantic hotel in the heart of Florence (by the way, we were oblivious to any noise, I'm not sure if some of the reviewers who mentioned it stayed at the same hotel) and are not expecting a 40 square metre bathroom (this is central Florence, not Florida) then come here, book early and get the Tower Room. This is Room with a View revisited. It's a great place.

<Content>Great Place I was very hesitant to stay at this hotel after reading some of the recent reviews. I am so glad we did not change a thing.The hotel is charming and posseses the tallest private tower in Florence where you may enjoy evening wine and beautiful views. Our room, #15, had a LARGE private terrace where we enjoyed morning coffee, picnic lunch, or late night cocktails.Front desk staff, bellboy and maids were all very pleasant and nothing but helpful and couteous. We sent out laundry with no problems.The location is exceptional. Nothing most tourist want to see is very far in Florence, but this location seemed to be the center of everything.Sure, the breakfast was a little weak, but we did not go for the breakfast.

<Content>Too hard to find and poor bathrooms and room layout Stayed one night and there is no shower just bath tub and the toilet part is located in a closet that had a musty odor to it. The room was okay and sufficient. There were no hotel ammentities at all. If you want a bed this place was fine. We started our trip at another hotel for a little more in price and it was much better. Would not stay again.

<Content>What a great place! My husband  I just spent 4 days @ the Torre Guelfa. We loved it ! The room was large, warm  sunny. I can't believe some people were whining about the bathrooms! They are updated, marble, hot water  good water pressure. Good grief, the place was built in the 1600's! It is beautifilly refurbished  updated. The location is perfect. In the heart of everything, but on a quiet little street! We slept like logs! Definitely would return!

<Content>A wonderful place I find it suprising to read a number of poor reviews about this hotel.Me and my girlfriend stayed here for two nights and it is THE perfect place to stay in Florence, it's in the centre of everything.Wonderful building, very interesting. - we had the priviledge of staying in two dir=fferent rooms, bith very charming and well appointed. The tower, with the view over |Florence has to be seen to be believed, especially at sunsetThe staff were brilliant, breakfast was typical of Italy and even the day we were late for breakfast the staff hapily gave us a tray to take to the room.Can't fault it, if you want period charm of real Florence you should try here. If you want typical 'Amercian' 4-star there are plenty of other options.

<Content>Not Worth The Money-Horrible Bathroom I was very excited to stay at the Torre Guelfa, but ended up VERY disappointed. The hotel is run down and, therefore, not nearly as charming as I expected. Our room was horribly noisy and the bathroom was the worst. The toilet was in a tiny room that had no sink and poor ventilation. The regular bathroom was nicely done in marble, but there was no regular shower. You had to stand in the tub and spray yourself down with the hand sprayer. There was no wall mount for the hand sprayer. Also, our room was very dark and dreary. If the place was re-vamped, it could be a great hotel. The only thing that was great about it was the location. The rooftop wine bar was overrated. The view is tremendous, but how much time are you really going to spend up there? The rooftop consists of approximately five little tables and chairs. Nothing more. I will not stay at this hotel again. I don't understand why it is written up in so many travel books.

<Content>Really liked this hotel My friend and I enjoyed our stay here. The tower is very cool and a great way to enjoy the evening and get some good pictures. The location was also ideal. Our room was quite nice - very good size and a good size bathroom. I think we had room 3 - it was right off the reception area so I was worried that it would be loud, but we had no problems either night with noise from the hotel or the street. It is well secured but I can see how it might be hard to find, although our taxi driver found it fine from the train station. The elevator is a blessing, especially since the hotel is on the third floor. Breakfast was just OK. We found the hotel staff to all be very helpful, giving restaurant recommendations and helping us find the train schedule on the internet to our next destination.I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>dreary, overpriced, the worst bathrooms After reading some positive reviews on this site, we booked 4 nights at Torre Guelfa. What a mistake! The first night, we had a triple which included an uncomfortable pullout couch as the 3rd bed. The hotel and rooms are dreary and tired at best. In the middle of that room is a small step up that I tripped over at least 50 times that day.The toilet was in a separate room from the rest of the bathroom, and the door to the toilet room scraped the floor when you opened it, all at the head of the person trying to sleep on the horrible pullout sofa. Then, to wash your hands, you have to go to the other bathroom. There, the bathroom has a tub with a hand-held sprayer to shower, but no shower curtain. All night long, the sound of motorcycles and trucks kept us awake. The next morning, exhausted from lack of sleep, I asked the desk person (who turned out to be the owner I think) to either change our rooms or help us find another hotel. He said he didn't have another triple available and had the gall to claim that the room was not noisy, but after giving me a hard time, he decided to give us a double and a single room. Our double room, although dreary, was quiet and fine. However, bathroom in the single room had a shower with no lip or separate floor, like on a boat or an RV, so that the ENTIRE bathroom floor got we when you used the shower. We certainly will joke about that bathroom for years to come!During the 5 weeks we spent in Europe, this hotel was both the most expensive and the worst hotel we experienced.

<Content>Mixed Experience The hotel is part of an old castle, and in a great location. The tower view is amazing--all of that makes it architecturally interesting. BUT, the service ranged from outright rude to indifferent (unusual in Italy). If you bring a car, be aware that it is 30 Euro a night / partial day to park. Noisy day and night--I had to wear earplugs to sleep.

<Content>What a View! My partner and I recently returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Torre Guelfa (in their Guest Rooms)and were very pleased with all that it had to offer. The hotel is in a great location by the Ponte Vecchio and nearby the Uffizzi Gallery which made it easy to start our sightseeing in the center of beautiful Florence. The rooms, although a bit dimly lit, were spotless and very comfortable. The daily breakfast included was perfect to start the day, and the staff extremely helpful in booking day trips to Sienna. Also, the view from the hotel's 13th century tower (with it's accompanying wine bar) is absolutely amazing! We had perfect weather when we were there and took full advantage of the view at sunset on a nightly basis. The only downside was that being quite an old hotel and in the heart of Florence, the noise at night was a bit loud. Next time I'd specifically request a quiet room. I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends!

<Content>very disappointed After reading reviews in travel articles I thought this would be a delightful small hotel with a lot of ambiance. Not a good decision. Finding the entrance to the hotel is a major challange after dark. It is a single locked door with no sign or light on a very dark street. No indication at all of the hotel location. I walked back and forth before discovering the entrance. Then it was through a dark courtyard to a tiny elevator up to the 3rd floor. Alone and after dark this did not make me feel good. The front desk was not friendly when I arrived as they seemed preoccupied with something else. My room (actually bedroom/sitting area) was quite large, but very dark and cavernous. The only bright welcoming spot was the new sink/shower area. The wc was in a closet like area off the sitting room and old and musty smelling. The cold tile floors on 2 levels that you could trip over in the dark made a trip to the bathroom at night a difficult feat. Breakfast was very nice and the staff was friendly at that time. However there are many hotels in great locations and patios with lovely views in Florence. I would never stay here again.

<Content>For that tower we would return We stayed in late Sept. 04 and the tower experience was AMAZING and I give it a 5, but since the room experience was a 3, I'm splitting the difference. The staff is FAR above the competition in regards to service - they were so wonderful with directions, suggestions, and help! And although our room and bathroom were absolutely huge and quite enchanting upon entry - the reality is that the tile floor (in both rooms) was cold in the middle of the night, we were too uncoordinated to keep the water in the curtainless shower, and this was the only hotel during our entire Italian vacation where we were swarmed by mosquitoes after dark. Despite the buzzing I'd go back in minute for that private view and the overall atmosphere. The nightly glass of vino while watching the sun set over all of Florence far outweighs any pesky mosquito.

<Content>great location! My husband and I were in Italy in mid-Nov. of this year. I would recommend this hotel for several reasons. 1) The location is great. It is very close to the Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi. 2) The staff speaks very good English and they are helpful and courteous. They recommended good places to eat as well as made the reservations for us. 3) We stayed in Room 10 which was a good size and clean and comfortable. If you were to pay the same amount for a hotel in USA you would expect more, but everything was more expensive there--especially hotels. What it lacked in amenities, it made up for in other ways. THe view from the tower is fabulous! It is a pain to get your luggage up to the hotel b/c you have to get on a tiny elevator to reach the 3rd floor lobby. The elevator could hold only me, my husband and our two suitcases! There is also a wonderful wine shop across the street.

<Content>This is a wonderful place! My husband and I spent 3 nights in room 24. It was a Jr. Suite. The room was beautiful and spacious. My only issue was the small 'wc' room that gave off a bit of pungent smell and there were really no views from the room. But the main bathroom was large and the bedroom and sitting area were beautiful. The lack of view from room was offset by the wonderful tower. It was the best! And the service at both the front desk and at breakfast is the BEST. The front desk personnel spoke excellent english and were always very, very helpful in getting us reservations for the various museums, calling taxis and giving us general info. Each evening at dusk many of the guest gather to watch the sunset and have wonderful wine from the fantastic tower view. The wine steward is so helpful and friendly. The location is perfect to walk to all the important spots in Florence and great. This place had a lot of charm.

<Content>not what I expected Many reviewers consider this hotel romantic. It is located in a old building with a high tower. Although the tower was nice- one can get a nice view of Florence at sunset while enjoying a glass of wine (served by the hotel for a charge)- overall, we found the hotel disappointing. The room was too small and uncomfortable for the price we paid. The access to the hotel is clumsy. The breakfast was below average. On the positive note the hotel is situated in a convenient location, close to the Uffigy Gallery and shopping.

<Content>The tower is great, but the rooms........ Stayed 1 night in early October. We had a double on the second floor.The room was dismal at best. Needs to renovated badly. Altough, the bathroom was newer , clean, and perfectly acceptable. I think most of the rooms are in this condition, but we did see a suite, with it's own terrace that looked nice.The location of the hotel is very good. A little hard to find and there is parking near by in a garage. The rooms and reception are on the upper floors of a building. There is a elevator, but it is very small.The tower is very nice, the view is great! This made staying here completely worth it to us. So if you go when it is cold and you can not enjoy the terrace on the tower, don't stay here. otherwise it is just a slightly run down, average hotel.

<Content>Stay away!! I am not sure why this hotel has so many good reviews as my experience was nothing but bad. I chose this hotel because several books said it was nice and the reviews here would seem to confirm this. Unfortunately this was not the case. I had rooms 4 and 5 and they were complete dumps. People often use words like quaint or charming when describing hotels that may have some flaws. This hotels problems went well beyond being quaint. The rooms were in horrible condition and desperately needed remodeling or at least basic maintenance. Both of these rooms had tons of peeling paint, mold, broken moldings, and a variety of other problems that just made for an awful experience. Stay clear of this place!!!

<Content>Can't touch this in Florence! Marvelous. I stayed in this hotel in July, 1999; but, reading the recent postings it is still up to its game. I traveled Central Europe and Italy with my mom, my best buddy, and my girlfriend. We thoroughly enjoyed Torre Guelfa. A friend had recommended a penzion across the way, but they were out of room, so on a whim we just walked across the street and asked for a room. WHAT A DELIGHT. This place was a bit pricey for us - at the time @ 160USD; but the tower was just a dream. I could sit on the tower deck and look about and not see a single tourist - because the streets wind about, and the tower is so high, the optical effect is seeing nothing but rooftops and structures, but no tourists. Sharing some wine on the tower patio just made a wonderful closing to every day of sightseeing (being one of the tourists I didn't want to see). Oddly enough, while sharing a LARGE jug of wine on the tower patio we witnessed a brigh light cross the night sky. It was the NASA space shuttle in orbit - truly amazing sight. My mom still waxes poetically about our tower. If in Firenze, you really should try this place. Ok, it isn't 5 Star; but, I'm not a 5 Star type of person. The rooms are nice, not overblown, but the common rooms are keen. Happy travels,CH
